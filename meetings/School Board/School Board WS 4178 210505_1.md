| 3:02:19| Anthony Thompson Jr., who had arrived at this public forum seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| answers regarding the death of their teenage loved one. As his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| father wept, police surrounded him and his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10947)|
| 3:02:31| Do you think that made him feel safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10951)|
| 3:02:35| I certainly don't. Is this overpowering police tactic the example we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| to continue on in Knoxville? This speak up and be silenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| mentality? When's it going to stop? We're supposed to be raising the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10963)|
| 3:02:47| community up and listening to the voices of those affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| We don't need police. We need programs. We need resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| And we need to make positive changes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10975)|
| 3:02:59| When you start listening to all the voices, that's when we make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10979)|
| 3:03:03| Until then, say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10983)|
| 3:03:07| Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10987)|
| 3:03:11| Summer Alwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10991)|
| 3:03:19| Hello, my name is Summer Alwood. I am a lifelong Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| resident and an alumna of all Knox County, not all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| but of Knox County schools throughout my K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11007)|
| 3:03:31| I want to first uplift the words of a friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| Brandi Augustus. She is a mother of Austinese students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| and she was not able to be here today. And I want to uplift her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| voice as a black mother with students at Austin East. And I think that's what we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| doing in all of these conversations is uplifting those who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| being directly impacted and harmed by these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| If Mr. Watson's house is on fire and my house is not on fire, we're going to go to Mr. Watson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| house and we're going to say, what's going on? What do you need? Let's get you out of here. Let's figure out how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| can get this fire put out. And so those are the voices that we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11043)|
| 3:04:07| uplifting. And in any community listening, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11047)|
| 3:04:11| process you all decide going forward, we need to be uplifting the voices who are being harmed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| this and who are speaking out. And so I want to uplift Brandi's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| that she's calling for the removal of school resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| officers from schools because she expresses, as we've all seen, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11063)|
| 3:04:27| police, whatever training they have, they tend to lose that training whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| they're dealing with black people. It tends to go out the window. We've seen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11071)|
| 3:04:35| here in this very body, as the person prior to me spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| when you have a multiracial coalition of activists protesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| and the only ones that are arrested are black. And so we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| right here in this body how KPD and KCSO officers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| unequally applying the law. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11091)|
| 3:04:55| so we can't trust those people to be in our schools and be treating all of our students equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| As we've seen multiple times, white men can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| into schools, into movie theaters with assault rifles, and they will be escorted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| out unharmed and even taken to Burger King, as we saw with Dylann Roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11107)|
| 3:05:11| We keep having to repeat this, but it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11111)|
| 3:05:15| And so, as Brandi said, black people are not, are perceived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| to not be able to be reasoned with, as was the case with Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| And they're not given the presumption of benevolence. And so in that case, police are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| focused on eliminating what they perceive as a threat rather than preserving life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11127)|
| 3:05:31| My mother, who's been a Knox County teacher for 20-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| described to me a school officer putting a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| grader, a seven-year-old, on the ground and handcuffing that student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| a black student. There should be no reason that a seven-year-old needs to be in handcuffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| And so, you know, Brandi also uplifted the idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| having logical consequences. You know, we have a police officer murder a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| at school, and so we respond by putting more school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11155)|
| 3:05:59| security and more burden on the students and blaming the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11159)|
| 3:06:03| and criminalizing those students. And what we need to be doing is getting rid of the threat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| which is the officers in the schools. And Brandi said, it's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11167)|
| 3:06:11| we're sending our babies off to the slaughter. And it's really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11171)|
| 3:06:15| awful to have to hear that from a Knox County parent. And so if we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11175)|
| 3:06:19| cultural competency, if we're talking about trauma-informed schools, your schools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11179)|
| 3:06:23| neither culturally competent or trauma-informed unless they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| considering the trauma that black and brown people experience at the hands of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| But I also, you know, those are Brandi's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11191)|
| 3:06:35| but I also want to comment on my own observations as a white woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| on looking the business of this meeting. You know, I'm really glad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| we're all kind of showing up to these meetings to see kind of the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11203)|
| 3:06:47| and the ways that those procedures are utilized to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11207)|
| 3:06:51| put forward and to thwart certain resolutions or policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11211)|
| 3:06:55| I was really appalled to hear Board Member Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11215)|
| 3:06:59| talk about, well, I'd like to thank all of the officers because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| my students are safe. Ma'am, if you can refrain from making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| comments about specific board members, please. Okay. I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11227)|
| 3:07:11| it is really awful to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11231)|
| 3:07:15| people, you know, they talk about all lives matter. A statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11235)|
| 3:07:19| like that does not say all lives matter. It says at least my child was safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11239)|
| 3:07:23| but I don't care about Anthony Thompson Jr.'s family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| You know, and this brings me to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| board members and just government entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11251)|
| 3:07:35| like this, they tend to always say, well, you know, I get what you're saying, but can you say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11255)|
| 3:07:39| the way we want you to say it? Can you say it in the right tone? Can you say it at the right time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| Can you not shout after people are speaking? Well, the thing is, when we come up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| the podium, you all aren't listening. And you're giving us blank stares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| And so we have to make our voices heard in other ways. And this is one of the ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| white supremacy operates, is it uses parliamentary procedure and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| rules as a scapegoat to stall action and to thwart justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| And so when we see, you know, you saying, well, I don't like that you put this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11283)|
| 3:08:07| in a resolution. I don't like subcommittees. This is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11287)|
| 3:08:11| just kicking something down the road, using the rules of white supremacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| to thwart justice and to thwart action. And it is cloaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| our indifference in the cloth of civility and telling us to be quiet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11299)|
| 3:08:23| in the language of telling us to be civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| And so, of course, as we end all of these, say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| Ashley Burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11311)|
| 3:08:39| Hi, Ashley from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| What a year to be on the board. Sorry about all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| It's been crazy this year. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| all of us can agree, board and the community, that we would all love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11331)|
| 3:08:55| to see more access to mental health services, social workers, health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11335)|
| 3:08:59| services and the like. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| I find this to be a very common theme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| among everybody that said anything to include your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11347)|
| 3:09:11| And I appreciate that. People in our community are hurting. The pain is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| understandable. The pain has become anger. And like most anger, we take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| out on the wrong people. We tend to take it out on people that don't actually deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| it. There are individuals and organizations that feel it's okay to take this anger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| out and act upon it, which does nothing to solve the matter, but does everything to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| keep the perpetual cycle turning. And unfortunately, there are those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| would not know how to even live their lives without this anger in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| The really unfortunate thing is that they then take those fears and anger and teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11379)|
| 3:09:43| it to our children. This keeps the cycles moving for generations with no true way to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11383)|
| 3:09:47| off the ride. I've heard a lot about accountability in the past few months, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11387)|
| 3:09:51| even on that subject, we are asking for the wrong people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| accept accountability. Instead, when we do, we begin to hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| our, instead, when do we begin to hold ourselves as individuals accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| and as a community accountable? When do we begin to show respect and love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| toward our neighbors? When do we begin to stop acting like bullies? When do we begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11407)|
| 3:10:11| to break generational curses and figure out how to change our family trees and teach our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| children how to better themselves? I believe there needs to be discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11415)|
| 3:10:19| that has been brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| for the, I think it's the MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11423)|
| 3:10:27| and I'm excited about that discussion. I'm excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11427)|
| 3:10:31| the fact that you're looking to the community and to leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=11431)|

| 3:20:33| That's not true for everybody at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12033)|
| 3:20:37| I've had to talk to my kids because their father is dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| because he was shot by the police during a mental breakdown because they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| not trained to handle it. Anthony Thompson Jr. is dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12045)|
| 3:20:49| because the police are not trained to handle that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12049)|
| 3:20:53| So I'm coming for you as a parent, as a widow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12053)|
| 3:20:57| as somebody who is in the military, as somebody who is a veteran to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12057)|
| 3:21:01| that you need to work with your communities. You need to listen to them. You need to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12061)|
| 3:21:05| to them. You need to. All these people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12065)|
| 3:21:09| are trying to tell you something. They're trying to tell you that we have a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12069)|
| 3:21:13| We worked hard on this. It's been. It reads really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12073)|
| 3:21:17| well. And it's coming from the person who it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12077)|
| 3:21:21| affects their district. And this is them saying this is what my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12081)|
| 3:21:25| district needs. This is what we are supporting. And along with somebody else from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12085)|

| 3:21:33| So just because you might feel safe and cozy when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12093)|
| 3:21:37| all your privilege doesn't mean everybody else has that safety. Say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12097)|

| 3:22:07| They got to speak their words. You know, I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12127)|
| 3:22:11| going to become a stronger community by communicating. Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12131)|
| 3:22:15| thank you very much for your time this evening. I know you're taking time away from your families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12135)|
| 3:22:19| And that hopefully we can get this done here and all go home and spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12139)|
| 3:22:23| some time with our families. I want to talk a little bit about masks today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12143)|
| 3:22:27| I know there's a lot of feelings around this. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| some pro, some con. What I would like to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12151)|
| 3:22:35| stick to is the science behind it. And even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12155)|
| 3:22:39| though we'll go over some of the science, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12159)|
| 3:22:43| what people, what their belief systems are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12163)|
| 3:22:47| plays a big role in whether that's for any reason, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| we can go over some science right now. But for most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12171)|
| 3:22:55| people, that's not going to change their minds on whether or not they want to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12175)|
| 3:22:59| wearing masks. Because the psychological portion of the brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| will kind of anchor to its emotional attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12183)|
| 3:23:07| But I just kind of want to go over some scientific stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12187)|
| 3:23:11| When we're dealing with our kids, I want to look at this from a scientific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12191)|
| 3:23:15| perspective, not from an emotional perspective. And though I get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12195)|
| 3:23:19| emotional side, and I appreciate it, and I know that all the parents in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12199)|
| 3:23:23| want the best not only for our kids, but for our community, but we really got to stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12203)|
| 3:23:27| to the science side of this argument or this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12207)|
| 3:23:31| I want to read a pretty decent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12211)|

| 3:23:43| in-depth study. And what they did is they had their conclusion. I'm just going to read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| conclusion here so we can kind of wrap this up really quick here. The conclusion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| the existing scientific evidence challenges the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12231)|

| 3:24:03| medical and non-medical face masks are ineffective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| in blocking human-to-human transmission of viral and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12247)|

| 3:24:19| Wearing face masks has been demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12263)|
| 3:24:27| effects. These include hypoxia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12267)|

| 3:25:07| Now this is a Stanford study. And so this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| a couple people coming together and just kind of have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| or having emotional feelings behind this. This is science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12315)|
| 3:25:19| And what do we keep hearing? Follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| science. But we have a lot of people come up and what they're doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12323)|
| 3:25:27| myself even, I have an emotional attachment to this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12327)|
| 3:25:31| But what I need to stick to is what the science is telling us. And if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| science is saying that wearing masks increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12335)|
| 3:25:39| a whole host of health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12339)|
| 3:25:43| and has absolutely no health benefits, why are we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12343)|
| 3:25:47| Why would we make our kids or have our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12347)|
| 3:25:51| wear something that is being proven to cause adverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| health effects and having no health benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| Now I'm sure a lot of us here would understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12359)|
| 3:26:03| going through the end of this year wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12363)|
| 3:26:07| masks. Though I'd probably be happy to see them gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12367)|
| 3:26:11| tomorrow, I would understand the school board going through the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12371)|
| 3:26:15| with masks because I think there is some simplicity and consistency with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12375)|
| 3:26:19| But based on the science, I think we should as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12379)|
| 3:26:23| remove masks from our kids and just from society in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12383)|
| 3:26:27| It does not change the spread of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12387)|
| 3:26:31| not only virus but any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12391)|
| 3:26:35| bacterial infections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12395)|
| 3:26:39| It just doesn't do that. I wish it did. That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12399)|
| 3:26:43| But with the science and what it's saying, it just doesn't. So I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12403)|

| 3:27:15| that this Friday, Austin East students are hosting an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12435)|

| 3:27:23| and I would absolutely love for every community member in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| to come out and support our students. Only staff and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12447)|
| 3:27:31| will be permitted in the parade, but community members are allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12451)|
| 3:27:35| align the Martin Luther King Jr. Street and we will start from Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12455)|
| 3:27:39| and go to Dr. Walter Hardy Park. And so that's this Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12459)|
| 3:27:43| starting at 4.30 p.m. Heath is taking forever to pull up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=12463)|
