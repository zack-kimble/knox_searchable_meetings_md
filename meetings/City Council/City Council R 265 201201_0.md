| 0:09:35| that she started her work in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=575)|

| 0:10:07| which you're probably also aware of is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| today is Rosa Parks Day in Tennessee, December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| On this day in 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| This act led to the Montgomery bus boycott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| and ultimately to the Supreme Court ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| that segregation on public transportation systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| was unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| As a way of remembering this important moment in our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| CAT is paying tribute to Rosa Parks all day today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| by keeping one seat open on every bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| The seat features a placard recognizing the contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| made by parks in the fight for racial justice and equality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and how this small act of sitting down on a city bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=645)|

| 0:21:57| Mr. Brace or Mr. Anders, did you wanna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| okay, Mr. Ryder, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Yeah, Mr. Anders, how many square feet are you guys in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Actually, we won't be replacing the building we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| And so what we share now is over on Barnard Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| with we have us and Knoxville Emergency Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| We'll actually be moving a backup site over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| We're losing our backup site at KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| So we'll be moving a backup site over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| and also moving FEMA over there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Okay, so is the square footage comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| or is this enable anything different to services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| or just it makes up for the backup space you're losing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| So it'll give us a warm backup spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| It'll also give more training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| for fire, police, and public safety area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| And it'll also give Collin a new EOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| It's just a much needed win-win-win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| So it's, oh, I told somebody yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| it makes too much common sense for government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| to do it this way, but we found a good way to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1376)|

| 0:27:12| that is the target of the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1632)|

| 0:27:20| no monitoring issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1640)|

| 0:31:18| Yeah, I believe Ms. Wade or someone from BMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| may be able to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| So I'm very supportive of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| and have long said we needed more social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| Ms. Goodwin, who was on the call a while ago from CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| hears from me kind of frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| There's a lot of places in the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| that I end up sending their outreach team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| to go and help folks that are camping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| And also Ms. Kline at BMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| I've reached out to her several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| So in the past, the two current social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| funded for BMC were only to cover areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| around the CARM area and 5th Avenue and South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| And the social workers, the two outreach workers for CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| were covering everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| So kind of speak to where they're able to cover everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| This is exciting to have, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| now eight instead of four total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| Yes, this is Becky Wade again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| And I'm really happy that Bruce Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| has joined us on the call too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| And he may want to comment further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| but yes, BMC will be adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| four additional street outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| to their current staff of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| And this will enable them to go to other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| rather than just the Broadway Central area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| They discussed the Old City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| which we know is a place where people congregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| And with this, the addition of these workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| I believe that it can be responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| to where camps come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| where people are congregating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| and be flexible about where they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| But I'll let Bruce comment further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| And maybe if Dr. Spangler could comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| exactly how their day goes or how their work goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| how they're best used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| And if you could just start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Yes, I'm Bruce Spangler, 511 North Broadway, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Yes, Council Member Ryder and all of the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| Yes, we will cover any part of the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| What this does, it allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| to be more expedient in our responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| And so by doubling or if not tripling our present staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| we should be able to respond very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| to pop-up camps and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Right now, our outreach workers are in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| anywhere from four to six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| The other hours, they are doing paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| in their office and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| But I hope that you have seen them around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| and we're just very grateful for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| willing to expand this service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| So I know there may be other council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Dr. Spangler, can you kind of elaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| what they're able to accomplish with the homeless folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| when they go out and make contact with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| What benefits come of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Well, one of the things is that they help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| with a lot of information and addressing misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| to help any of the neighbor, any of the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| that we're working with to direct them to permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| So it becomes a conduit for referring them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| to the four-year Salvation Army Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| to maybe CAC services or at CARM as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| So it just really gives a frontline opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| to be a roadmap for folks who sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| may be a little difficult to reach for a variety of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| but we have seen it to be very effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| in terms of connecting them with services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| that are very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| We also use our street outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| to identify folks who may be benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| to reunite with their family in another community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| And so we vet those as well as they are directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| towards our street outreach workers through KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| So you're meeting them where they're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| versus waiting for them to come in for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Yeah, I just wanna add that I've had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| to watch the current street outreach workers work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| and they do an amazing job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| And I think Council Member Ryder describes it well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| that you meet people where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| A lot of people, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| have a lot of trust issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| It's the relationship that they establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| with people who've experienced a lot of trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| who know in their rational minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| that there's help out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2172)|
| 0:36:12| but they just don't feel like it's available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| or comfortable accessing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| And the street outreach workers help bridge that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| And it's not one outreach effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| it's usually dozens, if not more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| to build that relationship and trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| so that people feel comfortable accessing the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| that are available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| So I'm thrilled that we're able to add to this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| because those are sometimes the hardest to reach people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| And we sometimes have the resources available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| but if we can't get people to access them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| then that's not getting where we wanna go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| So I'm glad that we're able to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| in this hopefully tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Yes, Mayor, I just want to congratulate, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| the administration for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| and the two previous ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| We're all struggling with what to do with homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| and people who need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| And to be able to access these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| and apply them in the way they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| is an excellent step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Of course, we've got a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| And then partnering with people like Mr. Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| and Volunteer Ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| we will continue that dialogue, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| and try to get a better handle on this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| I had a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| I am in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| One thing that I wanted to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| is how long we went without any social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| and without any outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| and then how long we went with just the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| And now to double that, it's a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| And that goes through 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| I think that's pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| And I think this needs to be one step of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| We have lots more to do as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| And we need to really consider beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| the relief funds that we've received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| what we're capable of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| I have some questions that I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| are gonna be answered today, later in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| regarding our reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| regarding our unassigned fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| and getting a clear picture of what more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| might we possibly be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2339)|

| 0:39:41| to provide administrative services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2381)|

| 0:42:52| to the Fountain City Skate Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2572)|

| 0:42:59| of that public use area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2579)|

| 0:46:18| Mr. Cannon, I know I had a brief discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| with you very recently about congestion mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| and how this will impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Could you make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| I think that's important as we talk about the climate goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| that we've set as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| and the mayor has the Climate Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| that's gonna be reporting very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| One of the things that we can do locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| is deal with congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| So we don't have exact numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| on how this will impact things or improve things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Not at this time, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| The city initiated this program in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| We're in the design and right-of-way phase right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| It's a long process getting this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| The thing that is most positive for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| is that on our key arterials, we will have connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| finally have connectivity between our signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| And the feedback will be centralized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| back to our Morris Avenue facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| That has multiple benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Number one, the timing of those signals can be adjusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| almost automatically based upon congestion matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| so that we keep people moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| The second thing is that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| we have to rely on 3-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| if a signal goes into failure mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| And we have to wait on that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| This will automatically tell us what is happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| so that we can send crews to address that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| The smart fix, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| that TDOT implemented years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| that was the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| towards this advanced traffic management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| This is taking that to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| And quite frankly, it will prolong, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| it will prolong our useful roadway life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| because we are able to manage congestion better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| on a holistic basis versus on an individual signal basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| So at some point, if we do have data or thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| on how it will impact the overall, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| picture on congestion and exhaust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| is that something that you could come back to us with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| And I want you to hear the improvements to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| The good news and the encouraging news to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| is that this is being done across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| The results have been remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| And this is why the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| and the state governments are so proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| in promoting the ATMS program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Well, I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| We've been talking about it since 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| And I know there's some federal and state things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| that have impacted how long this has taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| But when we talk about it in the budgeting time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| it's just fascinating that we actually have dumb lights now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| and we would go to smart lights at our intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| And even the lights you have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| probably 10 to 15 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| those would have been called the dumb lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| And the ones you have now would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| the greatest thing since peanut butter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| So we are constantly improving the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you, Council Member Ryder and Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| And Mr. Cannon, I'll encourage you to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| with the traffic engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| but also with Brian Blackman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| from the head of the sustainability office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| to help capture those things on a local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| So it's really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| And I'm pleased that we can bring this to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| And also no local match required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| is always a good thing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| So any further questions or discussion on this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=2993)|

| 1:00:12| plays a really important role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| during what we would, quote, call normal times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| providing marketing for the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| and for Knox County as a destination for visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| whether that's conventions or events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| concerts, festivals, sporting events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| and really through their efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| we're a premier destination for visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| which is a huge boon to our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| We wouldn't have anticipated in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| that a global pandemic would be coming our way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| and that that would radically change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| the way that visitors interact with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| We did ask a lot of Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Despite the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| you would think that their workload would have decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| instead, we actually asked more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| We really needed them to help keep our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| They played a really key outreach role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| with the business community, with event planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| and with others to help them understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| how to stay safe during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| how to adapt their business practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| how to make sure that we were marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| our community appropriately, not just for visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| but also for people who live there, or who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| So very important role they've played during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| So I think you have this in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| but we paid Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| and we typically pay them based on a projected amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| of hotel and motel tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| And although we didn't have as many visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| physically staying in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| as I had stated, we did ask VK to adapt their services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| to make sure that we were being healthy and safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| And because their work volume didn't change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| despite the reduced number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| staying in hotels and motels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| we're asking council to approve this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| which allows Visit Knoxville to retain funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| that we've already paid to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| in the fiscal year that ended in June 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And we do have Ms. Bumpus here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| She can answer any specific questions that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| about the type of work that they were asked to perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| and the ways that they've adapted their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| to not just keep us safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| but to also make sure that we're prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| as we recover from the pandemic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| And I'll be happy to take any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| but again, thank you, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| and Ms. Bumpus is on the phone as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| on the call as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Council Member Huguet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| I was just gonna say, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| I seconded the motion because as someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| who's living through it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| actually the easy part was living through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| the initial part of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| the risk to businesses, nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| and other people is what's coming now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| And to keep your staff in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| for when the vaccine takes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| and we can go back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| We cannot lose momentum and lose people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| so that when things get better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| we are ready to hit the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| So I would hate for Visit Knoxville to have to back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| by losing people and losing momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| So I certainly support us letting them keep the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| Thank you, Council Member Huguet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| Council Member Simms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| I had a good conversation with Ms. Bumpus earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| I think there is this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| that leisure and travel is just a luxury item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| And the conversation we had was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| well, one, I appreciate how they were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| to shift their role and still help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| with the economics of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| But what impressed me was how much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| they bring in for each dollar they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| And then I also wanted to have Ms. Bumpus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| talk about another criticism of it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| just being something that impacts or benefits downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| Would you mind talking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Definitely, and I did enjoy our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| and I just appreciate all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| and this opportunity, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Ms. Bumpus, could you just state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| and position and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Yeah, you know, it's Zoom, so I forget that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| Sam Bumpus, 301 South Gay Street, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| And again, thank you for this opportunity and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| And what Sima and I talked about was the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| and the power of tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| And I think it's important for everyone on this Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| to know that this is the number two industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| and it's what's gonna lead the economic recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| as we come out of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| We're already seeing that as East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| but just to put some numbers down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| and these are real travel expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| hard tax dollars, I'm not talking economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| It's a $23 billion in 2019 it produced for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| with 195,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| It generated over 75 million in new tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| which over half of that went to support education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| we're number four of all the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| and we generated 1.2 billion ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and 28.6 in local tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| and $64 million for this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| So tourism's a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| and it saves all of the Knoxvillians taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| in state and local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| So that's also important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| And during COVID, we have not stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| I mean, we have been promoting our destination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| for the love of Knoxville travel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| And even when we were in the shutdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| we were still putting messages of when you can visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| it's safe to visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| when you wanna visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| And we partner with all of our stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| on virtual events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| We put that out nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| I mean, there's been a lot of activity going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| And then we also became kind of the king of the pivot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| as Stephanie mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| and we helped with the census and Knox together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| We played a key liaison with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| I have definitely educated a lot of events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| on how you should do business during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| I've been screened at quite a few times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| just because people are frustrated and need help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| and want to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| So we've really, really tried to embrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| all of our stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| It has been a devastating virus to our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| And I think by retaining these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| it just makes us that much hotter out of the gate in 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| And just to put it in reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| we moved over a hundred events worth a hundred million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| of economic impact out of 2020 into 21, 22, 23, and 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| We also have booked over 60 new events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| into future years during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| So we never stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Some destinations did shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| We changed how we were doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| and we started to make it more conversational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| more relationship building and planners really responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| So I just want you to know that the end is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| and Knoxville is gonna be well positioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| to dominate out of the gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| with booking and soliciting business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| And of course, for the love of Knoxville Travel Safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| I mean, that will probably be an evergreen message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| So did that help answer, Seema?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| It did, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| And then we had also spoken about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| you talked with a lot of tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| and one of the reasons that they were traveling here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| was our mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| Could you talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| I definitely can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I mean, I think the reason East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| is leading the state in tourism recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| and that's been the way it's been since first to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| They want to go to destinations that have outdoor adventure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| So that's where our greenways and the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| are really playing to our favor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| They wanna be physically distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| and they wanna be in a place where people are wearing masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| and that's a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| Visitors want to get out of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| They wanna travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| But they also wanna do it safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| So I think I've had the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| well, why would we be marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| when the COVID numbers are out of control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| We're not marketing unsafely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| We're marketing and telling people how to travel safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| because they're gonna travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Whether we like that or we don't, they are traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| So the ones that are coming to Knoxville are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| because we can give them the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| that makes them feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| And there's quite a few silver linings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| that will come out of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| It's hard to visualize that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| but it's gonna happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| I mean, we're having talks with different partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| that we've never had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| And it's because these industries are starting to embrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| how important outdoor adventure is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| because that'll be a key pillar as we look to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| I just thought it was interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| that the people felt safe to come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| because we were wearing masks and mandating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| Thank you, Ms. Bumpus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4210)|

| 1:12:21| a variety of budget housekeeping steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| to keep the budget aligned with the many initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| that you're familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| as well as to reflect the city's ongoing response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| to the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| So I wanna first thank Susan Juneau and the finance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| for their work to prepare this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| and to bundle multiple items into the package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| under your consideration tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| In addition to Susan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| who can address specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| about the accounting and financial details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Deputies Grace, Gail, and Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| are also here to address particular items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| that you may have questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| I really appreciate your consideration and support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| There's one person signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| Is that right, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| Kevin Faddis with the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| employee rep from the Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| Mr. Faddis, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| I am, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Yeah, you know what to do, state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| president of the Knoxville Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| I just wanted to thank council tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| but before I start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| I wanna thank the mayor and her staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| for being so quick and thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| in appointing a new HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| So I welcome Dr. Kelly Grumman, if she's watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| So I look forward to working with you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| But I wanted to get on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| and voice my support for this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| I think it's very well thought out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| this pandemic that's going on at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| You know, things are moving, things are shaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| I enjoyed listening to Ms. Bumpus talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| how things in the city are progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| And from the Fire Department standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| we certainly haven't missed a beat either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| We've had to adapt and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| just during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| So like I said, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| I just wanna voice my approval of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| I don't know if there's any specific questions for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| or Chief Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| but I wanted to thank each and every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| for looking at this and the finance director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| for bringing this, you know, to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Thank you, Mr. Fass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| Council members, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| I'm guessing there might be a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| There's a lot to this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| which I had spoke to once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| just a couple of meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| that when this many things get lumped together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| there's certain things I agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| there's certain things that I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| And I feel like I don't get the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| to choose what I'm in support of or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| So there's plenty I'm in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| and other things that I question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| but I'm gonna vote no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| because I wanna be able to see each item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| and to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| Thank you, council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| I have a question for Director Janelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4534)|
| 1:15:44| I believe she's on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| I'll go ahead and pose the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| and she's ready to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| I sent an email to her a few hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| with some questions hoping she could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| just kind of set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| give me a financial overview of where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| and how this budget amendment might impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| This is Susan Janot, CFO for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| I did receive your questions and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| I did not get them in time to give you a written answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| but I'm glad to speak kind of generally to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| I know that you would like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| essentially, it sounds like how we ended up FY20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| and just kind of as a note of disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| the audit is not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| So I do wanna make that clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| that I'm hopeful that that will be released very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| We're on schedule, I think, to present that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| to the audit committee later this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| but just be aware that that's not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| So it looks like you were asking me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| first of all, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| if this amendment will increase the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| that we had planned to utilize a fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| for the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| And the answer to that would be yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| it will increase it by the $373,640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| So aside from that, in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| our sales taxes are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| a little bit better than expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| Last fiscal year, I think, year to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| they came in about 2% above the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| Of course, pre-pandemic, we were well on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| to come out quite ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| And the pandemic slowed down that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| Currently, for the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| we are still a little bit ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| I am cautiously optimistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| because those numbers run two months behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| And two months doesn't sound like a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| but in the middle of a pandemic, it certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| And a lot can happen in two months, as you're well aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Did you have other specific questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| And the total current land reserves, do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| Okay, again, I am somewhat dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| on how our audit will come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| But we should have, I'm hoping, around 19.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| in, I think, what you're calling reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| You're looking for available amounts in savings, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| I mean, in accounting terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| reserves mean something a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| So I want to make sure I'm answering the proper question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Well, I'm looking for that specific 20% policy amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| that we have in reserves, that specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| Okay, that would be 46.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| Again, all of this currently is unaudited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| That is what just, and for your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| we use that to cash flow various purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| Right, and then for, just for my information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| will we get, you know, kind of an itemized update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4774)|
| 1:19:42| on the different tax revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| during that audit presentation later this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| I presume that you, I'll be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| I don't know what that presentation normally looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| because obviously I'm new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| and I haven't been through it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| All of that information will be in that audit report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| So, you know, you should have access to that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| if it's not a part of the presentation itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| Again, I apologize, I haven't been through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| so I don't know specifically what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Yep, perfect, okay, those are all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| Thank you, Council Member Parker, thank you, Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| Council Member Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| and then Vice Mayor McCampbell will be after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| You're still on mute, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| Sorry, just talking to myself here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Okay, I wanted to follow up on one of the answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Ms. Juneau gave to Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| So let me get to that in just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| But since Council Member Parker brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| I just wanted to state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| and I'm apologizing for not staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| at the top of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| the audit committee where the audit company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| will be going through the CAFR will be on December 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| That has yet to be public noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| because we're determining whether that's gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| an in-person meeting as planned or a Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| Right now it's scheduled for the Public Works Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| on Thursday the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I hope I set that date correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Maybe Mr. Johnson will correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Anyway, that's what is scheduled at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| And to answer Council Member Parker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| the CAFR, which looks in some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| a lot like the budget presentation is what we go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| you as a audit committee member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| we can have any information we want reported to the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| So if you want the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| so if you want specifics on revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| let's tell Savannah and we can talk through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| and add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Ms. Juneau, can I ask you a specific question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| to follow up on the answers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Because I went through some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| with Ms. Gill last evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| On page 633 of our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4925)|
| 1:22:12| the amended budget is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| that reflects what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| so we have the adopted budget that we voted on May 26, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| And it has the, what we would be using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| out of the fund balance, which is fund number 5998| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| towards the top of the page 633 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| And one of the concerns that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| with some of the budget amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| that we're voting on tonight was it would appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| if you look at it that, wow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| we're spending a lot of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| But when you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| we're actually spending less fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| Ms. Gill pointed this out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| It's actually gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| We're not spending more fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| We're spending less fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| than what we approved in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| And I think that was Councilwoman Parker's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| was we're spending, if I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| were we spending more fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| but it looks like we're spending less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| And Councilwoman Ryder, if I can jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| because I hope that I haven't caused additional confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| This is Erin Gail W. Tamayor-Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| And Susan, the point that Lauren and I had discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| just to draw your attention to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| and Lauren articulated it as I did, so apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| And you can correct me on the record, Susan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| if I've totally misled Mrs. Ryder here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| But on our line-by-line breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| where it shows the different revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| and it indicates that the appropriated fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| that we have to transfer in to the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| in order to balance our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| that in the original adopted budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| we had planned on transferring in 11.4 million, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| but as a result of some of the additional revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| that have come in and the adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| that you've been able to make throughout this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| in this budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| that the amended budget that we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| only transfers in 10.4 million to balance that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| So it's a slight reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| But Susan, if I have led everyone astray here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| please correct me on the record and set them straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| No, no, no, I think you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| And I think it's confusing the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| that this has to be presented, Erin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| from an accounting standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Those differences between the verbiage in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| which is the $373,000 worth of use of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| those are new monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Some of this really, to reconcile back to the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| that you're looking at on page 633,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| that is due to COVID monies or grant funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| let me say, coronavirus grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| that are replacing monies that were presented previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5107)|
| 1:25:15| as a use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| I don't know if that helps or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| But that's what's happened, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| is just that the difference between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| in the ordinance verbiage is prior monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| from items that we have utilized in the past fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| relative to coronavirus relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| items that have already happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| and it's really kind of replacing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| Okay, so let me take another stab at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| If not but for the coronavirus grant monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| we would be spending more fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| but because of that inflow, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| Yes, that would be a correct statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Okay, because I had the same concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| that Councilwoman Parker had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| and I brought that up with Ms. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| and so that's how she explained it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Okay, we'll go to Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| and then Councilmember Fugate had her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5188)|
| 1:26:28| So on page 625 in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| at the very top, it says providing 100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| to the Knox Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| to provide internet access to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| for distant learning purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| How does this correlate to item 12b,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| where we are appropriating the sum of 100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| for what sounds like the same purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Yeah, that's exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Ms. Gill, could you explain the legalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| of why we had to put it in as a twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| Yes, I absolutely can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| So thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| and you are right to draw attention to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| because it could be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| It is essentially a two-part action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| So the budget amendment itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| is where we allocate the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| appropriate the funds into a community agency grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| And then that second ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| is where we take that community agency grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| and actually donate that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| to Knox Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| So because we're doing it through ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| the law department advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| that we did need to break it up in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| So that's why you see it appear back to back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| But that being said, it is just one sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| We're not allocating it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Yeah, thanks for that point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| I mean, and I wouldn't be opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| to additional funding for that purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| because it is much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| But thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Council Member Fugate, you had your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I don't know if you still have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| No, I was going to attempt to layman explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| what I thought the finance director meant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| which is basically we got grant money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| so we paid ourselves back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| and it's not as bad as we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| we were going to wind up spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| It's the way I understand it in layman's terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| But you have to, you had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| because we're having to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| you can't recognize the grant right at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| you spend the money and then you recognize the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| and pay yourselves back, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| That correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Good way to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I just had a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| and I thank everyone for the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| because I do think it made it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| And I just wanted to express my disappointment, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| We are living under a state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| It's during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| Our unassigned fund balance is not our reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| As Director Janot just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| we have 46.9 million in reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| We also have another reserve of a couple of million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| That's required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Now, 46.9 million, we use it for our cashflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| I think that's very smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| During times like the ones that we're living through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| we have to consider what is the proper use of our reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| And we are now ending our calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| We're in the midst of a fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| and made plans to use 11 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| of that unassigned balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| leaving additional millions in the unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| And our priority in the midst of this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| is to pay ourselves back with federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| that could go towards those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| with the greatest need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I just don't think that should be the priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| of our budget at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| Good business practice, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| but not good practice of a government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| that's supposed to be there to catch folks when they fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| So I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| I'm very much struggling with many of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| Some, I believe, are positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| but they do not, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| capture the urgency of the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Council Member, anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Yeah, Council Member Riley, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Ms. Gill, could you clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| because it took a little bit of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| between you and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| and I had one question about it from someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Could you clarify the State Street Aid line item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| So State Street Aid is not about the road downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| It's a revenue source that comes to us from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| to support transportation and street infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| This is the fund that has historically funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| the streetlights, and for those of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| who have been on Council for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| you know that that in past has amounted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| to $4.4 million of utility bills going to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| As a result of the streetlight retrofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| we took over the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| and now have reduced those utility bill payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| to about a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Actually, it's closer to 900,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| so it's actually less than a million every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| but we are taking on additional maintenance costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| for what are now our lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| So the total amount of money that we are spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| on the lights is still significantly less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| than what we were to the tune of $2 million saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| However, the line item that Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| is referring to is essentially a pole rental agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| that we will need to enter into with AT&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| for the lights that are located on AT&T's poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| There's a few thousand of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| scattered around the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| and now that we are the owner of the poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| we now are the tenant on that infrastructure that AT&T owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| So this is a line item that we have always known was coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| and it was accounted for in the streetlight project budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| and the pro forma that many of you heard me talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| about quite a bit as we did that streetlight project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| and the poles that are located on AT&T's poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| So we are now at the point where that is coming to fruition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| and, therefore, need to move or have those funds available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| for that contract in the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| Does that answer your question, Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Yeah, I just thought it needed clarity for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| since someone asked me about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| and I did not have full understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| of what the lease agreement was about to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| Council Member Smith, and then Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| I have a question for Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Could you explain the corona relief funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| just why it's categorized that, and the definition of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5609)|
| 1:33:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| There are funds, federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| made available through the state based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| I believe it's per capita amounts in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| In our case, it amounted to a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| over $2.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| There are certain stipulations upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| And our grant expert, Cheryl Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| has spent quite a bit of time on that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| and making sure that we leverage that appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| And so we were able to leverage the entire amount of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| the $2.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| But for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| every municipality should have had access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| to some of that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| and for the purpose of specific relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| for COVID-related expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| Okay, and when you say leverage that funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| what do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| In general, back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| there are certain stipulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| to being able to capture those amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| I don't know that every municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| has been able to meet those stipulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| and we were fortunate in that we were able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| And that was $2.8 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| Yes, it's the $2.8 million that is a part of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| $2,812,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| So most of these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| just like the money that we're gonna vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| on the next item for an office education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| most of these items have come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| in front of council individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| But I think there's some new items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| that are here for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| Ms. Gill, would you mind addressing those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| that have not come in front of council before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| There are a couple of things, but there's a lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| I mean, we're not even, this is where we're funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| I guess it's moving monies around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| but it is a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| that this is where the body cams money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| And that's an additional amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| to what the police budget already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| the huge amount that the police budget already was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| There's just a whole lot here to take apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| between a gym floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| There's some E911 facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| There's just a lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Ms. Gill, would you mind talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| what is new to the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| what we're seeing for the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| I will take a stab at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| but I'm gonna have to ask for some assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| from my colleagues, Director Brace and Ms. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| if she's on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| But to your point regarding the body cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| and David, please jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| I wanna make the point that the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| for those body cameras as a project has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| So you have, as council, seen and endorsed the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| for those body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| And a portion of the funding for those cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| that we've always known was coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| has been sitting in what we call the 706 Equipment Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| And what this budget amendment does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| is it brings those funds out of the Equipment Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| where they've always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| and we always knew we were using them for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| and brings them to what I call meet their friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| that you had allocated as part of the main budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| adopted back in May to allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| to be utilized toward that body camera contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| as you all have approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| And again, we've known and talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| when we discussed that earlier this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| that there were two sources of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| that would support that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| And so this is housekeeping to bring those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| into where they can be used to support that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| So there's a few other items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| but I'm going to let David maybe articulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| a few of the ones that he's been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| that would also be maybe newer to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| since I know you guys are very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| with the body cameras project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Yeah, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| And Ms. Singh, it may be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| just to do a very quick run through top to bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| and just briefly discuss which each item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| why it's in this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| So the real estate positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| there are several that are HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| when I say HR, just positional in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| that are being relocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| to meet the organizational needs of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| So there's two real estate positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| that are being moved into engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Those are two civil service employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| that have agreed to that move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| and they are now reporting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| through the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| that does the vast majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| of real estate related acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| if you think about all of our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| We've got positions that have been in civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| but now that many of those functions are being done by HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| I've sat down with Ms. Hatfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| and two vacant positions will be relocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| into the human resources department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Now that those functions are being completed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| and done by HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Ms. Hatfield is aware of that and agreed to that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| There is a vacant administrative assistant position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| that was always intended to be sent over to HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| and was originally budgeted in the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| but now that we have an HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| an HR director, it needs to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| There is a longtime vacant operations manager position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| in public service that's being moved over to support HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| and that was the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| We are no longer, do we need a deputy director of fleet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| Keith Shields, the fleet director, retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| There's been some reorganizing in fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| That deputy director position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| the resources for that have been moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| into the economic community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| We'll support the efforts of what Mrs. Welch is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| The emporium lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| so many of you probably know the 100 block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| part of that revitalization was the arts community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| And so this is an error on my end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| During the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| that lease has been in place for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| and it was re-upped in December of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| And I failed to include the additional funding requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| for that new lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| And so as that first payment hit, we realized that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| and again, that was on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| I just failed to include it in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| So that is to bring us whole on that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| There was, there's on-call work that was being done in KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| that some officers voiced concern about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| The chief brought that before the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| There were some concerns about violating civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| and some of our practices for paying people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| So the 54,000 is to rectify that issue in internal affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| We talked about state trade aid, small sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| So the state has passed some legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| about local municipalities needing to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| certain permitting services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| for those small sale installations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| We don't have any choice on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| We have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| And we now know what those costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| So this is a have to, not necessarily want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| but we need to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| Community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| We had always budgeted dollars for the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| It needs to be moved into special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| into the neighborhoods conference budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| So it's literally shifting dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| from one line item to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| Human resources is now spending dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| that we knew they would spend once they were up and running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| and we're now bringing them whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| to that next $100,000 transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| We talked body cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Fleet services for a long time has needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| to replace a fuel system, tanks, pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| With the new public works complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| we held off on replacing them at the old KPD facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| but we're now going to replace them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| not to replace them, but install them at the new complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| So that was always budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| but now that we're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| we need to move it over into that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| TEMA, which is the Knoxville Emergency Management Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| they have a very old mobile command unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| It's over 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| Colin Ickes is on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| if you have questions specifically about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| The city and the county had always planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| on replacing that vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| It came in a little bit above budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| so the city and the county are splitting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| City will pay for it, county will reimburse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| And so that was an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| Colin, I'm not sure if you need to add to that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| Just real quickly, I'll add that the reason for the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| Mr. Ickes, just state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| My apologies, Colin Ickes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| director of the Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Emergency Management Agency, 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| I'll just mention the reason for that shortfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| is internally we had gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| as part of this we're trading in our old mobile command truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| and we had gotten, internally we've been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| a really, really rosy estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| of what the value of our old truck would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| It's coming up on 15 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| And the estimate we were given is it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| about 25% of its original value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| and that turned out to be just really quite overoptimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| So when we were given the actual trade-in offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| as part of the purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| it left us with a bit of a budget shortfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| which is what we're asking for to make up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| I'd be happy to elaborate if you need more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| And then just two other items that I'll discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| and then we've already talked about the Corona relief items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| So earlier in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| city council approved a lease with E911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Director Anders was on to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| This is appropriating $3.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| that will be reimbursed from E911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| to handle the capital build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| So the city has the space, the real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| at our new complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| We'll lease that, which is the lease you approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| but E911 will actually pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| for all the construction build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| And so this is allocating dollars to build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| but knowing we're gonna get the money back from E911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| And then the final item is a little unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| but we have a recreation center out in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| along Asheville Highway that we had a contract with a roofer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| and the roofer came in and removed a lot of the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| at a bad time and we had lots of damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| And then we got into a situation with the charity bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| and replacing the roof, but lots of interior damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| So not to offend any lawyers on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| but right now it is between the lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| and we need to get a rec center open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| because we are busing kids now for our afterschool program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| over to Cal Johnson and it's been 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| And so this is to allocate 500,000 to repair the gym floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| and all the water damage and really fully renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| this center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| And we're gonna let the lawyers and the insurance folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| figure out how much money we can get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| from the general liability insurance folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| So that is the final item and appreciate the patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| and I know we've discussed the other items below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| and I will mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Actually, would you mind going over the other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| I know that we've discussed some of them or most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Sure, so we talked about Knox Ed Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| PBA renovations, so because of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| we've had to make physical changes to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| the 150,000 for First and Second Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| because of the pollution and to deal with the litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| and pollution that has been in those water systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| And then we've got the personnel investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| There was a firefighter payout for annual leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| that actually had a net savings for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| for those firefighters that was brought by Chief Sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| and by the association requesting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| and it made sense financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| And then there were payouts to general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| and to the uniformed officers, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| as part of investing in our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| and keeping the city running during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| So Christmas bonus is sort of, is what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| That's not how I would characterize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| No, it does coincide with the same month as this holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| but the reason is because of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| just the hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| And I think it was in council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| Roberto's invocation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| some people working there exposed to greater challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| because of COVID and they can't work from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| and they have to just deal with some extra challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| plus the other things that are in the description there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| So no, it's not a holiday bonus or Christmas bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| it's related to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| But the timing, I'm sure is opportune| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| for some people who do have greater expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| around the Christmas season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| I know there's been a lot that's gone on this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| I think COVID and the malware or the ransomware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| happened like right at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| It's been a pretty crazy year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| But the reason I wanted to go through all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| is to show how many different items there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| And I know that this is a strong mayor system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| but I feel like if I'm going to be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| where I'm asked to look over items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| then I need to look over specific items, not lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| You know, the majority of this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| But when it's given to me this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| as a yes or a no for all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I don't feel like I'm really participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| And when we don't talk about all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| it's not very transparent to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| who are watching the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| Not everybody reads the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| So that's where I'm coming from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Council Member Ryder, do you have your hand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| Yeah, I just wanted to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| that there is, Ms. Gail pointed it out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| and I'll just state, I had asked Savannah Maupin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| council staff, our auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| to get an accounting of all the COVID money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| and the expenses related to COVID that had come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| And she got that for me in an Excel spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| And after gathering that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| I appreciate that the city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| has posted it on the city's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| It's under the COVID-19 page on the mayor's office page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| And it's a city's response to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| And it's a full accounting line by line of $5.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| that has been used to support local initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| and expenses related to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| And so I want everyone to know that that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| and you can go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| I asked for that because there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| inaccurate comments made on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| where most inaccurate comments seem to come from these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| about how people, governments, not just our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| but governments spend COVID money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| And so I wanted a list of what we'd gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| and how we'd spent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| And so I appreciate that being publicly posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| and want to point out to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| that it's there for your perusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| And to let us know, as council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| if you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| and we can get information from staff on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| And yeah, thank you to the finance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| and communications team for getting that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| posted to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| A couple more questions that came to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| One is about timing and whether there is a need for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| to be passed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| The reason I ask is because we have several amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| related to KPD, yet we have a commitment this Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| to spend some time going through KPD's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| and having getting a better understanding of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Is there a reason why we need to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| these budget amendments before that workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| Well, I would just say that workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| is about the current year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| It's not gonna be an opportunity to make amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| to that budget at that juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| It's an information presentation and input session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| So that, you know, we have a major budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| that we plan to go forward and bring ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| from the community and from staff and from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| into that budget, including innovations in public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| So that is definitely gonna be happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| is happening already, and those proposals will come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| in the next year FY21-22 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| So that's sort of a very important topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| but not relevant to the current year budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| that you're considering amendments to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| Well, one question that I have is the KPD on-call salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6703)|
| 1:51:51| 50-something thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| It just seemed odd to me that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| following the discussion of KPD's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| during the budgeting process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| it was made apparent that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| KPD uses the unfilled positions to pay for overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6727)|
| 1:52:15| to pay for, you know, unexpected expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| We obviously are not able to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| all those positions this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| It's just hard to imagine that from that budget line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| the largest in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| we couldn't find another 50-something thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| to cover these needed salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| Also, considering that we have received emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| that KPD has had to pull back on some of their patrol work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| because of COVID concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| so we don't even have a sense as a city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| whether KPD is having to take as much overtime as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| but I just don't have a sense of why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| their current budget can't cover this expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| Mr. Rice, it looks like you have-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Yeah, just very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| and then the chief can jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| and talk more in detail about the response changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| during COVID for non-emergency accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| which I think is what you're referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| So I think your first question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| we need to pass this budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| because we have, I need a rec center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| that we need to get fixed for the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| that are being transferred over to Cal Johnston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| and we have to move forward with HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| We've got a director now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| We need to get those positions filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| So many of these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| all of these items need to be done very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| and we need this amendment to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| The unfunded positions in KPD, you are correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| and Ms. Juneau can comment on this if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| At the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| as we balance out areas where there are over expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| and areas where they're under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| there are times where unfilled positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| help clean up at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| The 54,000 for these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| is our dollars that we're spending right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| Individuals are on call and not being paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| to carry their phone while on call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| and when we realized that was happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| the chief brought that to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| which is not fair to those employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| and they're not being compensated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| for literally not going out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| not maybe if you're out one evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| and you want an adult beverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| you can't get an adult beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| You're on call with your phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| but you are not being paid for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| and so when that was brought to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| we were obviously concerned about making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| that we were being fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6878)|
