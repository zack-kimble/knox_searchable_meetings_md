| 0:01:43| Thank you Director Boock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| I'd like to take a moment to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Can I get a motion? I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| Second. I have a first by Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| and a second by Commissioner Bustler. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Aye. Now I'd like to take an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| for our law director to swear in those who are going to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. If you are here to appear and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| testify before this beer board, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Raise your right hand. Everybody that's going to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| swear and affirm that the testimony you shall give in this matter shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| help you God. I do. Thank you. You may be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=155)|

| 0:02:43| chairman schoolmaker, commissioner schoolmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Under section 2.3 of the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| you should keep in mind that any person who lies to or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| intentionally misleads Knox County Commission, this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| or any other committee or board of Knox County under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| authorized statute, state of Tennessee and our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| may be held in civil contempt and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| called for civil perjury. So keep that in mind as you answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Thank you director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| And now I'd like to turn it over to the clerk's office for the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| The first one is Shell Fulmark number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| two thirty eight Andrew Johnson Highway owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Mr. Patel. First offense August 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| 2021. Second offense is September 21st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| 2021. In district eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| Mr. Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| attorney with professional address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| 2125 Millbrook High in Knoxville representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Mr. Patel and Michelle Mark number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| Mr. Patel is here with me. We have provided you some documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| which we hope that you will find helpful. I'll ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| let him actually respond to some questions particularly with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| the same. We have now placed in operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| the new DCI point of sale system and we've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| had them come back in a specific program. The photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| that I've attached for everybody's application albeit not a video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| we do have a video but it basically prevents that system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| from being manually overwritten. Unless somebody just grabs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| a case of beer and runs out the door. If it goes through that system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| it will not access a scan of a valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| driver's license to be able to be defeated or at least that is what has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| represented to us and that is what has been demonstrated in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| utilization of the center. But I have Mr. Patel with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| I've got to go through the procedure here. Would you state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| name sir? My name is Natasha Patel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Couldn't hear. Oh Natasha Patel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Everybody hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=311)|
| 0:05:41| Oh yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=341)|
| 0:06:01| Extra counsel or I mean extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| credit for counsel pointing out the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| Go ahead. Yes sir. My name is Natasha Patel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| And what is your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| 238 Andrew Johnson Highway Knoxville Tennessee. And what is your business address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| What was that? Your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| Same thing. 238 Andrew Johnson Highway Knoxville Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Now let me tell you what the procedure is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| Officer Lawson here is going to state what you're what he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| accusing you or what the county's accusing you of selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| You will then either agree with that or disagree with it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| then you will have a chance to have a say and your counsel can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| also. But since he went ahead and said this and he wasn't under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| were the things that your counsel just represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| in this letter and the pictures are they true to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| your own personal knowledge? Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| Officer Lawson. Yes sir. On September 21st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| entered his shell station at 238 Andrew Johnson Highway and was able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| purchase beer from the business and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| ID was not checked. Okay sir. Do you admit or deny those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| allegations? We admit. Okay. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| anything you'd like to say before the county commission asks you questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| Other than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| he's already said that you've sworn is true to your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| That's about it. I mean like I say we're trying hardest again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| we retrained the employee as well to identify underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| customers specifically. They also have taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| course by Raja. They all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| attached two certificates showing the course was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| So they have gone through proper training now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| I turn it back over to you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| I'd like to open the floor up for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Mr. Chairman I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| I'm going to make a motion that we impose a fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| or a suspension but I have just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| clarification. Has this business been before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| us for their first offense yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| They were before us last month or not? This business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| I don't remember. We have several repeats on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| It is my understanding that they have. I mean basically these two offenses were picked up just boom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| boom. They put in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| and evidently the employee or whatever was able to override it and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| Now you literally have to scan the driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| There is no other way to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you for that and I do appreciate you putting in those measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| because obviously it's a serious issue. We don't want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| selling alcohol to minors but I guess my clarification is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| have we imposed a penalty for the first offense yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| Yes he was fined $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| Well as I was actually before the meeting advised by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Mr. Boog I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| second offense is actually supposed to be a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| have a precedent of $1,500 so since the first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| was a $1,000 fine I'll make a motion that we impose a $1,500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| or a 60 day suspension whichever Mr. Patel chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| We would certainly be very receptive to the fine as opposed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| suspension if you would so be inclined to grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| I have a motion on the floor. Can I have a second? I'd like to open up the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you Mr. Chairman. Are all of your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| aware that the state of Tennessee on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| driver's license has made it pretty much idiot proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| with the line that designates that that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| is under 21 years of age so before you even put it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=621)|

| 0:11:05| scan it and if it popped up a no sale they could type in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| and they could override that sale. They can no longer override it. They could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| manually override so there is once they scan that driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=673)|

| 0:13:21| the procedure here. I'll get Officer Lawson to give the statement and then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| either admit it or deny it. You've already said part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=805)|

| 0:13:53| I admit it. Okay. Is there anything else you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| to say before we turn it over to the commission? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=837)|

| 0:14:17| testimony. I remember when you were before us last month and I genuinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| believe that first offense was an unusual occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| I don't think it was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| intentional on the part of your employee but this one obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| was not good. So that's the motion. $1,500 fine or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| 60 day suspension. Okay. May we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=877)|

| 0:16:13| Okay, now you've seen the procedure here. Do you understand the procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| you'll go through? Oh, absolutely, yes. Okay, well I'll ask Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Lawson to make the allegation. You either admit or deny and then you can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| whatever you'd like to say, okay? Yes. Officer Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Yes, sir. On September 21st, an underage person with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Sheriff's Office entered the business at 8929 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| They were able to purchase a twisted 24 ounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| tee and they did check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Yeah, I think the issue was she did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| check the ID but she put in the wrong date and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| so that's how there was a mistake. So you admit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| that happened, correct? Yeah, this employee is very new, not even a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| and since then she's done the training and we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| certificate here so we know that she's now well trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Hopefully we don't do it again and also she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| trying to pay the fine. I think she has until January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| some date in January to pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| So that's basically and I'm very unhappy that this happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and this is our first offense and we've had the business for over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| Thank you. Officer Lawson, just for clarification, is twisted tee beer or malt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| liquor? Honestly, I couldn't answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| that. I don't know either. It's in the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| section. I'm going to entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| I'd like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| a motion that we impose the first offense fine of $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| or a 30-day suspension. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Second. First by Commissioner Hill, second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Commissioner Durd. I'd like to open up the floor for discussion. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| I was going to ask that same question. Are we positive that it's beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| or malt liquor because we had this incident earlier on this year where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| it was alcohol and I don't think anybody said yes. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| being the same cooler which doesn't mean it technically is just because it's in a cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| Earlier in the year it was purchased as wine. That was from Don Gallo's and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| that was the issue and then at one they did... Did the liquor take out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Yeah, they did liquor at another Don Gallo's. Are we positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| that this is malt liquor or beer? I can Google it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| I don't want to pass judgment that we're not sure about. Does malt liquor fall under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| TABC? I believe we can do malt liquor and beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| Yeah, 5% or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Did I understand you correctly that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| cashier was selling beer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| liquor, beer at that time without training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| Yes, they have a month and she was less than a month and she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1161)|

| 0:19:29| that as soon as... So they can sell beer up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| a month before they go for their training service. Yeah, she just joined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| I did not know that so I learned something. We looked up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| rules and we said, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Commissioner Hill. Have you installed any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| type of extra checks? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Melissa? We do have a system where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| you can scan in the ID but it's not like automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| You have to put in the date of birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| or whatever and she put in the wrong number so that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| So we're trying to figure out. I just learned about this thing which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Scott Jones was talking about this new thing and I was asking my manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| should we get something like that and so we'll definitely think about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| because that's important. It's just not a very good thing to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| worrying about that. Lieutenant Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1225)|

| 0:20:37| Is there any other discussion on the floor? We have a proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1237)|

| 0:20:53| $1,000 or a 30-day suspension. Which do you choose? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| $1,000 would be better. The clerk's office will be in contact with you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1257)|

| 0:26:45| on Maynardville Highway, was able to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1605)|

| 0:27:01| Mr. Wortley, and say whatever you'd like on behalf of your client. They're taking steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| to make sure that everybody, before they start selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| takes the beer server's course, and if they need to, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1629)|

| 0:27:21| Thank you. I'll turn it back over to you, Mr. Perkins. Thank you, Director. I'd like to entertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair. This location has had a problem before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| I've got a question before I make a motion. Who sold the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Give me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| Because before in this, if you remember when it was before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| he sold the beer when it was in somebody else's hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| and he did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| training then, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| So he sold the beer then. It was illegal. He sold it without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| even asking for an ID this time. It seems like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1689)|

| 0:28:17| before I make the motion, this seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| a problem with this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Well, under the law, under the statute, the license is issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| to the person, not the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| So the person, if he passed muster and the license is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| his name, his prior record, whatever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| shouldn't come into play, shouldn't be relevant in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| So if the license is properly in his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| that's what you have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| Unfortunately, I don't like the way the law is, but that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| I'm just asking what our options are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Now, we have a problem with the language of one thing, and I made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| the motion to give this person the license to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| and operate their business. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| explained to them when he was working at the other place that you could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| sell unless you had the training. He now owns the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| and now he made a sale knowingly and not asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| for ID. There is a co-owner, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| he's here, and he's taking steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| to ensure that the law is complied with in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| He does have a language problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Okay. As a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| offense, it's normally $1,000 or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| I will make that, but if he comes before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| in the next few months again with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| violation, I will not be able to just give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| the fine. I understand. I've explained that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| I'll make a motion for $1,000 or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Entertain a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| We have a proper person, a proper second. We'll open up the floor for discussion. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner Bussler, I believe back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| in the spring that at this location they had their third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| offense for selling beer to minors, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| they sold it to this gentleman here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| and he was actually the third offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| where you made the motion, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| properly second, and everybody voted in favor of suspending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| their liquor license, correct? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| So then now he takes over. He's already had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| one infraction, but now because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| legally in his name, this is really a second, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| we can only qualify it as the first one. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| what the law director said, correct? And we cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| there's no way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| for the interest of public health in Knox County that we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| that this is a nuisance business that's operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| selling beer to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| The nuisance statute would be different. You wouldn't be dealing with it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| Carlton Bryant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| has discussed with me, he usually comes to these meetings in the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| Office, the problem with this particular place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| I didn't look at, and I'm assuming that there's proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| documentation to show that the business has been legitimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| transferred with a new business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| and all of that. It's a problem that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Mr. Bryant has said with regard to this business and some other businesses which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| they seem to hopscotch and keep selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| I told him, and he's looking into getting something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| done at the state level to modify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| beer ordinance, which we're under as a state law beer ordinance, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| an update on that sort of thing that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| on, but right here, right where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| you've got to operate under the beer ordinance, the state statute, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| may be something to look at with regard to a nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| that you can't deal with it as a beer boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| I have a question. Is it zero or 30 days, or is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| seven days? Mr. Buick, is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| instead of zero or 30 days, is there a, we can suspend for seven days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Is that an option to us, or no? Suspending for seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Yes. I'm sorry. I'm asking, yes, so right now we're saying $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| or a 30-day suspension of license. Is there an option to say a one-week suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| No, there's not. So it's zero or 30, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| We're bound by what's written there. Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| does this board have the authority to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| a scanner to be installed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Before you guys, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| laid the previous minutes of the past two meetings that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| ADs involved for you guys to look over so you could see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| when it was purchased and whenever they had their new beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| I believe one of the things, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| a little discretion we could do is maybe talk with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| and Lieutenant Lawson. If we go back, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| the fourth time this has been in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| You can obviously see Commissioner Busler is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| very worried, and I can definitely see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Commissioner Busler. Before us, we have a prop, oh I'm sorry, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| Ward? If I may interrupt, we also, after this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| done, confirm that the business license is different, has been transferred from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| ownership party to another ownership party. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Commissioner Hill? Just out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| and this may not be allowed, in this last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| sale, did money exchange hands, or was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| this just a sign from one person to another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| No, there was an exchange of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| compensation. There was a sale of the business. More than a dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| I'm sorry? More than a dollar? Yes, ma'am, considerably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| Commissioner J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| Can you restate what the motion is? The motion on the floor is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| have either a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| for Big D's market, whatever they choose, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| the first is from Commissioner Busler, and the second is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Commissioner J, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| No, I paid the fine. Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| Commissioner Busler? If this person, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| if this person comes back before us in the next little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| and I'm still on commission, it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| not be just a fine and a suspension. It will probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| a suspension. I understand that. I'll explain that to them, and I will further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| something that's got to stop. I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| We have a proper first and a proper second. Motion on the floor. All those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| favor say aye. All those opposed? And the ayes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| have it. Clerk's office will be sending you an email shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Commissioner Smith? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Officer Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| out of curiosity, we had five violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| on September 21st. How many businesses were checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2185)|
| 0:36:37| Twenty-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| That's almost 25%. Thank you, sir. Thanks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| what you do. Is there any other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| on the floor? I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| Director Buch, you stated that we follow basically the state's guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| so if we were to want to do an ordinance change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| we could not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| I will double-check that for you, but basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| the licensing for beer establishments is set by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| state law, and that's what we have adopted in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| I will look into that bill for you and see if we can, because it does need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2237)|

| 0:37:25| Whenever you get back to me, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| it's okay with this body, I'd like to forward you that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| and what he does. I would say it would be before our next beer board meeting, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| at the next meeting we can have that as a discussion item, if that's okay with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| Moving forward, is there any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| I'd like to entertain a motion to adjourn. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| All right. All those in favor say aye. Aye. And we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2269)|
| 0:38:01| Good evening. I call to order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2281)|

| 0:38:41| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Commissioner Lundy, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| please lead us in this evening's devotional? I sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| Jacob, can you put up the photo that I gave you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| So, to be honest, I don't think I've ever done a devotional in my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| publicly, so this is my first time. But a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| I was able to go to Atlanta and I wanted to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| the Martin Luther King Museum and I came across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| this statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| and I want to start off by reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| The beloved community is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| realistic vision of an achievable society, one in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| problems and conflict exist but are resolved peacefully and without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| bitterness. In the beloved community, caring and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| compassion drive political policies that support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| worldwide elimination of poverty, hunger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| and all forms of bigotry and violence. The beloved community is a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| of heart and mind, a spirit of hope and goodwill that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| transcends all boundaries and barriers, embraces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| all creation. At its core, the beloved community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| is an engine of reconciliation. This way of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| seems a long way from the kind of world we have now, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| believe it is a goal that can be accomplished through courage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| and determination and through education and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| and if enough people are willing to make the necessary commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| So that really touched me because I think about and I reflect about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| on our past year during COVID, so many things have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| We have argued so much, mass versus non-mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| Do we stay open? Do we close? We have protests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| increased violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| just everything, Democrat versus Republican, zoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| just so much and I'm thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| how can we come together as one not counting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| and to me it's all about respecting each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| and I was led to the scripture Galatians 5-6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| and it says the only thing that counts is faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| that works through love and I know we all have goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| to have a better community and a better county that's profitable where people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| thrive, but we're going to have to get to the point that when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| have a belief and a faith in something that we want to do right, we have to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| through love and it's a love that respects people's opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| regardless. I'm really tired of sitting up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| and people always judging all of us. We were the chosen leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Everyone up here was elected. Do we agree on everything? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| But I respect all my colleagues and if they need me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| outside of these four walls, I'm going to be there for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| and I hope that there are more people that can act like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| It's not that serious. Life is very short and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| to do a better job at communicating. So with that being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| said, I just want to take this moment to pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Please bow your head. Dear God, thank you for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Thank you for this opportunity. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| at this time and this moment in time, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| are really calling us together. With all this disruption that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| in our city, our county, our state, our nation, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| world, I know you're trying to teach us the lesson and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| pray and hope that we can get that lesson and start moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| towards that beloved community that you have called us to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| No, you did not call us to be the same. You didn't call us to have the same mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| You called us to be individuals, to respect and love each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Please help us change our hearts and minds as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| continue to walk this walk. We all have a purpose on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| earth. Let us fulfill it. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker, would you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| I pledge allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2597)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker. We will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| now set our agenda for tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| If it pleases the body, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| how tonight's meeting will flow. After we set the agenda, we will then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| vote on our two consent calendars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| and after that, we will move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| to honorary resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| and two presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Then we will have public forum, our first session of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| Then we'll approve our minutes and we'll get into the rest of our non-consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| I would like, without objection, to move one of our public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| speakers to after the consent calendars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=2651)|

| 1:02:08| As Commissioner Ward would probably agree, this has a very close and dear place to my heart as his mother and I both thank our Lord that are both breast cancer survivors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3728)|
| 1:02:20| and this one means a whole lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| Today I have the ladies here with us from the American Cancer Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| I've had an opportunity to meet them multiple times, and they're just amazing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| and they've actually placed some pins for you guys up by your name badges, and I see the majority of you guys are wearing those, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| Whereas, according to the Center of Disease and Prevention, CDC, breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| and is expected to be diagnosed in 281,550 women in the United States in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| Whereas, increasing the public's knowledge about the importance of early detection of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment can save lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| Whereas, Breast Cancer Awareness Month is a worldwide annual campaign in October to highlight the importance of breast cancer awareness, education, and research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3784)|
| 1:03:14| and to promote mammography as the most effective weapon in the fight against breast cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| And whereas the efforts of various organizations have made a major contribution to spreading breast cancer awareness through outreach, education, and screening programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3800)|
| 1:03:30| and have empowered women with the life-saving message of early detection and the importance of having regular mammograms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| Whereas, one such organization that is dedicated to the fight against cancer is the American Cancer Society, located both nationwide and in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3818)|
| 1:03:46| Whereas, the commission wishes to acknowledge and commend the extraordinary commitment and effort invested in this cause by the American Cancer Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| and the other organizations in our community who are working towards a cure and to raise awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| Whereas, Breast Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity to unite all citizens in our community to show their support for everyone affected by breast cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3839)|
| 1:04:07| and to help prevent breast cancer deaths through increased education and regular screening tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| Now therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| The Knox County Commission hereby recognizes October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| and encourages all Knox County citizens to join the fight against breast cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3863)|

| 1:04:40| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| I have the ladies here from American Cancer Society and if you'd like to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| Absolutely. I'm Kayla Shelby. I'm the Senior Development Representative for the American Cancer Society and a 19-year cancer survivor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3894)|
| 1:05:03| So, this fight is personal. While, you know, breast cancer impacts everyone in a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| the reality is that one in eight women will be diagnosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Those are mothers and sisters and aunts and friends and those are people with families that will grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| and go through that process with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| That's why it's so important that we continue to raise this awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| and I just appreciate you for taking the time tonight in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| Specifically, you know, over the last 18 plus months, screening has impacted dramatically through COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| People were being delayed in their screening. Now, they're getting diagnosed later and farther advanced in their stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| So, now more than ever, it's time to buckle down, wear the pink, spread the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Ladies, I encourage you to talk to your doctors, have those conversations with your health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| about your risk, your age, when it's time to get screened, how to get screened and what's best for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3951)|

| 1:06:07| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=3967)|

| 1:08:45| We responded to properties valued at $300,340 and had a property loss of $147,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4125)|
| 1:08:53| which means we saved an average of 51% of the valued property with an average response time of 4 minutes and 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4133)|
| 1:09:02| 86% of the reported fires were contained to the room of origin, with 71% starting in the kitchen or the cooking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4142)|
| 1:09:12| Oddly enough, the theme for Fire Prevention Month, which is also in October, remains the cooking and kitchen fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4152)|
| 1:09:21| Station 30 and Halls remains the busiest fire station again, responding to 164 emergencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| but we have a new player in second, and that is Station 34 in Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| responded to 102, I don't have those numbers, sorry, and Station 41 in Farragut, sorry, Commissioner Schoonmaker was third this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4173)|
| 1:09:43| The North Battalion remains the busiest with 537 emergencies and the busiest hours for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| For emergencies, this month was between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| A slight change from what I usually report, you notice these people standing behind me and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| I want to introduce you to some pretty special members of the rural metro fire family, as well as one special young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4200)|
| 1:10:08| This is Madison Harbour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| So Madison is a young lady that, like most of us, headed off to work on April the 15th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| but on this day, Madison's life would change forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| As she turned left onto East Emory Road in Gibbs, she was struck in the driver's side by a small SUV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| pinning her in the car and causing major trauma to her left side, particularly her left leg and her left hip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4227)|
| 1:10:36| As our crews began to cut away her car to get her out, paramedics Randy Wilson and Eric Bradshaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| I'll get them straight in a minute, began treating Madison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| Her left leg was bleeding profusely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| We did not bring pictures, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| I wanted to keep it all clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| Her left leg was bleeding profusely and barely attached to her body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| Our fire medics administered fluids and new medication that enhances the body's ability for blood to clot, thus slowing the bleeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4260)|
| 1:11:09| When she was freed, they loaded her in our fire medic unit and rushed her to the trauma center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| well within the golden hour for trauma care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| Twelve surgeries, some 26 screws in her body, particularly in her pelvis and left leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| Several months in UT hospital and extended therapy, Madison is not only alive, but walking today as you saw on her own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4285)|
| 1:11:34| Friday, Madison, along with Fire Chief Jerry Harnish and Mayor Glenn Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| had the honor of pinning these firefighters and some others with the prestigious Fire Service Phoenix Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| Oddly enough, some of those special skills and equipment that they used to save Madison on that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| were only available to them for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Before that, it was they weren't on our trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| As I told the mayor on Friday, the system, as we call it in emergency services, worked that day in Knox County, as it does every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4318)|
| 1:12:10| And Madison is living proof that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Madison, you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| These amazing first responders, I don't know where I wouldn't be here without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| And they deserve all the recognition that they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| And I'm just so happy that I'm still here, and it's all thanks to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| We wanted to bring these people, as many as we could, most of them are working on fire trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| and Madison, to you to introduce them to you and let you share with us in their extraordinary success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| Randy Wilson has been with us for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| Mr. Dobbs, we call him Josh Dobbs, he is really not Josh Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| That's the joke with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Josh has been with us two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| He actually worked the extrication tools that got Madison out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| And then Mr. Watham, two and a half years also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| So they're newbies, they're babies in our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| And there were several others that were instrumental in Madison's success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Eric Bradshaw was the other paramedic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| So we just wanted to bring them to you, to introduce them to you, to let you know that the system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| It works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Madison is living proof of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4413)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you, gentlemen, for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| Madam Clerk, please read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Presentation by Knoxville Chamber of Commerce President Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| Good evening, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Good evening, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| How are you all tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| I would like to request that next time I speak, I go before Mr. Bagwell, because I can't compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| So just a little update on our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| So the last two times I've been up here, I've talked a lot about how full our prospect pipeline is, and that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4459)|
| 1:14:27| We continue to see pent-up demand from a lot of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| Supply chain issues that are impacting the country are driving a lot of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| as a lot of people are trying to think more strategically about where they put operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| A lot of companies here are starting to look at expansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| We have 69 active projects right now that equate to about just over $1.8 billion in capital investment and a little over 13,000 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4483)|
| 1:14:56| For us, and I've talked about this before, a big part of our work now versus where it used to be is about expansions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| helping companies here who have made the commitment here, have hired local people to be able to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| So of that 69 projects, 25% of those are expansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| And so that number continues to grow month by month for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| We're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| The areas that we're seeing the most new prospects are in health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| So a lot of pharmaceutical, excuse me, and other things related to COVID and hopefully soon post-COVID movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| So a lot of electric vehicle, automotive, and then what we call power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| So how electricity, electric vehicles, things of that nature, how we're getting power to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| In the last couple months, we've posted 14 site visits for companies looking to relocate or expand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| And over the last four months, we've done over 100 expansion visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| So we've done about 25 a month with companies that are here talking to them about their needs and see how we can help them grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| We are targeting specific markets right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| So we have some areas that we are not being able to grow organically and that we want to try to get some companies here to help out the companies that are already here be able to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4566)|
| 1:16:15| So we've been doing some very targeted marketing in the Chicagoland area and in the Miami, Florida area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| And early results are very positive with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| Moving, kind of looking at our employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| So unemployment in Knox County is at 3.3%, which is almost a full point below full employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4587)|
| 1:16:35| And even more concerning is that our labor force month over month decreased by 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| We lost 4,400 people out of the labor force in the last month from July to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| Knox County job at the same time, the job postings in this area in the county have increased by almost 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| So a couple other things we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| We have developed a plan for a national program called Tech Goes Home, which works with families that do not either have the technology they need, the Internet access, or the tools on how to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4618)|
| 1:17:11| So we're hoping to secure a grant for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| We've created an internship toolkit to help companies grow their internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| A lot of small and medium-sized companies just don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| They don't have full HR departments, training departments to create internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| So along with the partnership with UT, we created kind of a toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| They can go in and take those tools and be able to create internships themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| We have been working with the mayor's office on the American Job Center, trying to kind of increase their production so that we can find more people, get these people working, get them the skills that they need to be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4656)|
| 1:17:50| Next, we have just completed a two-week talent attraction campaign in the Chicagoland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| So what we did was we purchased social media advertising, advertising in Spotify, as well as two digital billboards in Chicago, and we targeted UT graduates that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4678)|
| 1:18:11| There are about 1,800 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| The advertising was focused this time on IT professions because it is one of our ones that we're really struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| Next time, maybe healthcare could be something in the manufacturing sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| But we had over 400 people in a two-week time period click on that advertising and go to a specially made webpage that we designed for those folks, showing them all the IT jobs, showing what's great since they left Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4705)|
| 1:18:41| So we're going to do more of that in specific markets across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| The only other thing is that Development Corporation in Knox County, I've talked a little bit about that, that transition continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| Just this last week, the board of TDC approved the structural transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| So the attorneys are now working everything out on that to get it all correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| From there, we'll have a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| So if not, then by the end of this calendar year, we're hoping in the next quarter after that, we'll have that all complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| So I'm happy to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Mr. Odom, if I heard you correctly, significant loss in the labor market due to, I'm sure, 1,000 variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4759)|
| 1:19:30| But job postings were up, and additional opportunities for employment is up with a market that has virtually no unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4770)|
| 1:19:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| So I was encouraged to hear some of the initiatives you all were working on with workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4783)|
| 1:19:52| In the past, the chamber has been much more focused on just recruiting companies to come here without focusing on that element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4792)|
| 1:20:01| Do you feel like the next couple of years, your focus is going to be dominated by the workforce side versus the recruitment side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| And what else can this community do to help build that pipeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| Because we have to figure out our labor shortage if we're going to retain the companies we currently have, much less attract the new ones to walk in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4814)|
| 1:20:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| So the vast majority of our work right now is on workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| So whether it be what we call workforce, which back in the old days would be called blue-collar jobs, or talent, again, using that nomenclature, white-collar, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4829)|
| 1:20:40| So we're growing our population, as you all have seen in the latest census data, although they have not released yet the granular data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4840)|
| 1:20:50| So as we kind of talk about, we are getting older and we're getting younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| So we're growing significantly in 55 years and older and 23 years and younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| So we're getting folks here to go to school and then they leave and they come back when they're ready to retire, which is one of the – our hypothesis is it's one of the biggest problems with our labor force is retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4863)|
| 1:21:15| So if you think in past economic disruption like the 2008 housing market bust in that area, the stock market shrunk by about 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4875)|
| 1:21:24| In about the year and a half of COVID, the market is actually up 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| So a lot of people who – pensions, 401ks and the like said, you know what, I'm just not going to deal with working from home, Zoom meetings, disruption, everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4889)|
| 1:21:40| So I'm going to go ahead and just retire, and that's what's really hurting us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| So we're trying to replace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| We've got to backfill all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| So that's a very poor answer to your question, so let me address that directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| We're trying to keep people here more so than we're trying to bring new companies in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| When I talk about our talent attraction – I'm sorry, our business attraction efforts, they're very targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| So we are trying – we are being much more picky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| We're vetting a lot more companies before we try to bring them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| We want specific companies that could help the companies that are already here, and then we're working very robustly on the workforce and talent pieces for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4928)|
| 1:22:18| And of all the inquiries, of all the site visits that you – which were amazingly high, 25 plus a month, what are the companies that are from outside of our market looking here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4938)|
| 1:22:31| What are they – what are the key indicators they're asking you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| What are their key decision points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| What are they most concerned about or most excited about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Well, the biggest question is workforce, and that's by far – that's dominating everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| Then it's infrastructure, so the viability of traffic, transportation, broadband, things of that nature, the business climate, which we do really, really well, not a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4967)|
| 1:22:58| So – but workforce is the biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| We have – excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| We have a company now that is actually interested in one of our sites, one of our industrial parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| And so we have been – we've actually talked about incentivizing them to put daycare on their site because then we can get a lot of these parents who can't – because of childcare issues, can't get in the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=4991)|
| 1:23:23| That's another labor issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| So we're actually trying to think creatively and innovatively about how we're doing this to try to get some of our folks who just need a little – if we could get the right situation, we'd be able to get back in the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5005)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Do we have anything in the works to utilize the Pellissippi Place joint partnership with Blount County for those – that property that we have there off of Pellissippi Parkway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5023)|
| 1:23:54| We've actually been showing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Interest over the last couple months has actually increased there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| There are still some issues related to the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| There was – kind of the egress from TDOT somehow was not correct, and so we're trying to get that straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| So it's really hard for us to be able to promote that one too greatly until we get that part figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| But we do have some interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| So we're promoting that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| It's a great piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| Is there a section of the workforce that's in higher demand on one end or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| You said IT, but are we looking for – you're talking about a lot of factory-type stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| Before, are you looking for $15-an-hour guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| Well, it's all going to be over $15, $15 and above now just because of demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| The number one job section – sector in this area is remediation, waste management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5083)|
| 1:24:52| A lot of administrative is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| Below that is – I'm drawing a blank, but I know third is professional services, which is more the talent piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| and then right after that is manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| So that's kind of how it's falling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| It's been pretty static for the last three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| Are there any further questions or comments for Mr. Odom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| We will now move into the public forum section of our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| We have three more individuals who signed up to speak to public forum during the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| The first is Mr. Kevin Murphy, and I'll call Mr. Murphy forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| The other two, we have Ms. Sandra Korbelik and Ms. Joyce Feld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| and these two ladies have requested to speak when the item comes up, which is item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| So, Mr. Murphy, if you'd state your name and county of residence, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you very much, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Tonight I'm here on behalf of the Board of Advocates for the Knox County Planning Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| to speak to you in support of the contract that you've just approved with Kimberly Horn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| to work on the general plan and comprehensive transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| KCPA's core mission is advocating for intentional growth with coordinated infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| and that's exactly what Knox County is proposing with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| With this update and robust participation, intentional dialogue from stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| and dedication to implementing the recommendations of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| this will positively position Knox County for future residential and economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| It will help preserve our sense of place that makes our community so desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| and is the reason that people want to live and work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| We're particularly interested in the listening and learning portion of public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| That comes up pretty quickly in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| While I'll personally be speaking and doing some advocating during that listening-learning phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| I'm also really committed to some intentional listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| As you all know, often land use is really adversarial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| and this is a chance for us to get out of the adversarial arena and have some good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| We are going to work as hard as we can to encourage as many people from the public to participate as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| That's really important, and we want a wide variety of views on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| That's something that KCPA is going to lean in and help with as much as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| to just galvanize and get people in so we can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| We're going to hear stuff that we're not used to hearing, and I'm looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| That's better for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| I hope that you'll also really join in in that listening and learning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| I think that's important for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| The other piece that we're really excited about is that there's a fiscal analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| and scenario modeling component of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| Joe Minicozzi, he's a member of the project team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| and if any of you saw his presentation he did here in Knox County in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| or if you've seen one of his webinars, I was just watching one on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| he talks about the fiscal cost and tax revenues for land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| and the infrastructure cost and capital expenses and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| It's eye-opening, and it's really game-changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| If you haven't seen one of his, I strongly encourage you to look him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| He's got a TED Talk, and there's a number of recordings, but it is really game-changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| I'm so excited that that's part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| KCPA wants to express our appreciation to Mayor Jacobs for putting this on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| and putting this proposal forward, and we'd especially like to express our support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| to Directors Benedict, Brooks, and Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| who they did a really great job getting this statement of work crafted in a short time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| and they're going to need all of our support over the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| I think this is a huge project they're undertaking, and they will need our full support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| We support, so anyways, to conclude, KCPA supports the general plan update project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| and the contract that you approved with Kimley-Horne tonight. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Before we move on, just for clarity, we do have three individuals who signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| for public forum at the zoning meeting, so if any of those are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| just know that you'll be given a chance to speak when the item comes up during the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| Approval of minutes of the previous meetings, and there are two set, September 1st and September 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| We have a motion to approve by Commissioner Smith, with a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5378)|

| 1:32:01| to serve a four-year term expiring October 31st, 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5521)|

| 1:32:26| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Commissioners, with regard to item 35, the acceptance of Judge Emery's retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| it will fall to this Commission to appoint a replacement for Judge Emery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| I have instructed the Commission Office to begin soliciting applications next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| and we normally would have about a 30-day window to receive applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| but we'll be needing to proceed on that appointment certainly by December at the latest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| because Judge Emery's term does expire on December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| Just wanted to make the body aware of that procedure that's coming soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5586)|
| 1:33:14| Madam Clerk, please read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| It's Resolution R-21-10-110, appointing two individuals to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5597)|
| 1:33:26| Terms expire October 31st, 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| We have two slots to fill on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| There are three individuals that have expressed interest in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| One we heard from last week, Ms. Catherine Ogrode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| The current members of the Ethics Committee, Billy Stevens and Michael Covington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| have expressed willingness to serve again if either of them are appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| So there are essentially three names for us unless there are others that would like to be nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5637)|
| 1:34:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| I believe that she has to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| and then the open spot can be one of the two that are going to be over their term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| That's correct, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| Thank you for that clarification, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| Well, I suppose then we need a motion to elect Ms. Ogrode to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5667)|
| 1:34:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Motion by Commissioner Bussler with a second by Commissioner Biggs to elect Ms. Ogrode to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| Are there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| Ms. Ogrode is elected to one of the positions on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| The only two applicants we have received for the other spot are Mr. Stevens and Mr. Covington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5700)|
| 1:35:09| Commissioner Biggs, I got an email earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| and they were trying to send their letter to, I guess, the wrong email address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| Is there any way possible that we could just put the dates when another position will be available on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5723)|
| 1:35:32| or something like that so they can apply next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| Is that OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| Whenever the next person comes off so they can apply the next go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| Sure, that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| Are you talking about advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Well, there was a person that tried to apply, but they couldn't apply properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| They went to the wrong place to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| So I was wondering if I could let him know when the next position is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| so he can apply the next time when there's another position available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| For the Ethics Committee or for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| For Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| If that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| I don't know when the next opening will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| I figure it will be a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I would just make a note to reach out to that person prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5772)|
| 1:36:23| So I guess the proper procedure would be to take nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| I wanted to ask the Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| is there any way we could just vote the one nominee we have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| and then advertise for another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| When does the Ethics Committee meet again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| When is it, Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| It's quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| I think it's in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Coming up November is the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| The terms expire tonight, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| They expire tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| We have to have a meeting by the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| and then they will reorganize with their chairman and co-chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| And that was nothing against our two current servants, Mr. Stephen or Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| It's just that, you know, you like to have new people every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| So I might understand, Mr. Law Director, that we do need to vote on one of these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| The chair will entertain nominations just for procedural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5851)|
| 1:37:37| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| Mr. Chairman, I'll nominate Michael Covington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| Mr. Schoonmaker nominates Michael Covington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| I'll nominate Mr. Stephens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Mr. Biggs nominates Mr. Stephens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| Do I have a motion that the nomination cease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| So moved by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| So we will be voting for either Mr. Stephens or Mr. Covington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| to fill the second position on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| This will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| Please vote for either candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Madam Clerk, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5894)|

| 1:38:22| Covington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=5902)|

| 1:40:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| I pulled this one off consent last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| and asked for some additional information from the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| I'm not sure who would like to field the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| but I just wanted some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| because this did not have any specifics of the scope of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| or a dollar amount, so I was just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| I'm going to let the powers that be known and can explain that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| Aaron, Captain Yarnell will talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| I'm Captain Aaron Yarnell with the Knox County Sheriff's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| I'm Captain over the Technology Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| First off, I'd like to apologize for any confusion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| It's really pretty simple once you hear the whole story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| so I'm not going to be talking for an hour about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| In a nutshell, and I'll answer any question, obviously, that you may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| but in a nutshell, network security is one of our main priorities at the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| We have seen that Knox County-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| We have made a lot of changes over the past couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| a lot of proactive changes when it comes to virus protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| malware protection, new hardware, new software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Part of this process was to integrate a new on-cloud email exchange server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6122)|
| 1:42:10| As a lot of you may know, on-premise email exchange servers has vulnerable areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| that could be targeted by cyber attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| With that being said, we wanted to move towards cloud-based services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| similar to what Knox County IT had already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| moving to Office 365 and Office Exchange in the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| As we started this process, I reached out to County IT to get their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| Since they have went through this process, it's obviously a very costly process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| and I wanted to make sure I did my due diligence in talking to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| who has been a part of this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| especially within our own building here in our own jurisdiction in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| With that came the suggestion of Avero, a company I was not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| I had seen them online, but hadn't met them personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| They had done a lot of good work for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| and we reached out to them, spoke with them about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| That's what started the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Kind of a complex situation when you talk about migrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| an on-premise email exchange server to the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| Sounds pretty easy, like a click of a couple of buttons, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| It's a long process. A lot goes involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| But being a major part of cybersecurity, it's something that we wanted to work towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| We contacted Avero, contacted them about these services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| and what they would provide in assisting the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| We obviously don't have the IT staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| not even that Knox County IT has a lot larger IT staff than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| We've got about six people compared to their plus 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| So we knew we'd be needing some assistance with this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| Being recommended by Knox County had been used before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| and speaking with them, we was very excited about this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| to get us into the cloud server to be as safe as possible with cybersecurity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| So that's where this started. That's where it's at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| We also have representatives from Avero here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| but also from our finance department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| But that's kind of it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| Thank you, Captain Nairnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Do you know the general timeline of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| and the estimated cost of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Time-wise, from start to finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| could be up to a year, year and a half of implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| of a whole new exchange email server on the cloud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| along with the services that go along with that with Office 365,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| which you guys are familiar with that you guys utilize as well in county IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| Cost, like I said, we've got people here that can analyze the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| a little bit better than I can because there's different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| when you talk about cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Avero would be the company we wanted to use to analyze our network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| to look at our strong spots, our weak spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| to see exactly what we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| If we wanted to start from scratch, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| with the new .gov domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| also run it up through Active Directory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| with several different components to this exchange service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| So this was step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Step one is to get a third party in that has been used before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| that obviously is familiar with Knox County, Knox County's network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| to get their opinion about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| to where it wouldn't just all be coming from one entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| One important part that I think that we pride ourselves on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| at the Sheriff's Office is being able to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| with other members in the IT world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| You heard it from the previous speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| IT positions are hard to get and there's a demand for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| So we try to cooperate with each other and help each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| I know Mr. Webb has been a big help for the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| and as well he would say the same thing about us, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| But this is the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| I completely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| I understand the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| I understand what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I'm just trying to get a sense of there's a scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| It's going to take a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| What's the estimated cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| You're asking us to approve a contract that has no scope of work and no price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| I'm just really trying to make it really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| I don't need a ton of details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| I get what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| I'm just trying to give a ballpark of what you're asking us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| I'll let a representative from Averill speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| My name is Mike Caffrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| I'm with Averill Advisors, District 5, West Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6385)|
| 1:46:33| There's two pieces to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| One of them we were hoping to complete in short order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| and that is to get through discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| As was pointed out a couple minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| there's a lot more complexities to this than just moving mailboxes to the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| So through a discovery period that we're hoping that we can compress into a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| a week and a half, that's phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| Phase two, we were looking at not just the email piece of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| but also from a security point of view, triage the system that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| and patch up any gaping holes that might exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| I would expect that to be done within a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| As far as the migration itself to live, a year, year and a half seems like a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6442)|
| 1:47:33| Some of these things can and will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| I think what we'll know best after discovery, after two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| is how much other things need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| At this point, it feels like doing brain surgery on a sprinter while he's running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| So you've given us three scopes of work, discovery, triage and patch, and migration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6469)|
| 1:47:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| Does anybody have an estimate of any of those three projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| Altogether, we're looking at, and again, these are rough numbers, about 50K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6480)|
| 1:48:07| For the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| For the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| Discovery is going to be roughly half that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| That's all I really wanted you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| I was going with the same line of questioning that Commissioner Jay was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| that there was a ceiling to our cap, how much we were going to be spending on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| and what just the discovery alone was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Could we break it up for discovery and then the rest of it afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| Because after discovery, what you discover is what the rest of it is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| My other question was, is there a hack or anything that happened to lead us to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| that we're at right now, or is this just effort of maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6526)|
| 1:48:54| What we can look at is the end-of-life service on a lot of Microsoft projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| especially being an on-premise exchange server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Regardless if there was 10 hacks or one hack, we don't like to call them hacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| but attempted network intrusions, we're still looking at end-of-life on on-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| email exchange servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| Nothing that specifically said, hey, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| This has been an ongoing process for network security for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| along with Knox County IT for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| Just to clarify, there's not been any violation of any private information that citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| nothing like that has gotten out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| Oh, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| I just want to make a positive comment about the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| I've been working on a project, and I've been dealing with Blount County on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6582)|
| 1:49:50| One thing that I've found is when a county guy talks to another county guy, you get the real story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| So they had nothing but high marks for this company that you guys have selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| So I'm glad you guys did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker, this company has a great reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| I am very glad to see the Sheriff's Department doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| This is something that needs to be done, and I'm just very happy to see you all doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| And whatever it costs, $50,000 to figure out we have $200,000 worth of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| I can assure you in the long run we're better off trying to fix these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6635)|
| 1:50:43| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| I, too, appreciate you taking the time to do this and take these steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| One question I have, since we're doing ballpark figures saying it's $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| is there an actual cap to what we will be spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| Say we're assuming it's going to be around $50,000, but no more than X amount of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6659)|
| 1:51:17| Chris Caldwell so graciously helped us on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| We had three-quarters of a million dollars to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| We have spent around $400,000 so far, so we have around $350,000 left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6685)|
| 1:51:32| Between the equipment and the other things that we are going to have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| it may cost upwards to about a half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| so we do have some extra capital money that we may be able to use for this to finish up the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| To clarify that, there's hardware involved with the software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6707)|
| 1:51:56| Are there any further questions or discussions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| The motion is to approve item number 40, resolution 21-10-302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6719)|
| 1:52:06| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| Thank you, Mr. Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| You almost got away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| Tonight we did three honorary resolutions for three separate categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| and you have some amazing women and men that work for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| One of the things that I didn't see get a whole lot of media attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| but out in the 7th District did get a lot of attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| is one of your officers saw a house fire, a car parked very close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| It could have engulfed the entire home, but he grabbed a water hose real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| and kept the fire at bay until Royal Metro got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| If it would be okay with you and my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| I would like to do a resolution for that officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| I don't know who it is or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| Maybe we could work together and do a resolution for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| because what an amazing act and a real hero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| We were going to come to you all with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Well, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| You can just ruin it for me, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| I'm honored that you would say that, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| I certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| I think, as Jeff told me in the back there, that he had asked the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| if he wanted an application, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| no, I just want you to hurry up and get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6824)|

| 1:53:54| so I'll be reading the revised caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| It's a resolution approving a signed location lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| and memorandum of lease agreement with the Lamar Companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6841)|

| 1:54:19| for a term of 10 years with an automatic renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6859)|

| 1:54:40| Sandra Korbelik, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6880)|
| 1:54:49| I'm Sharon Davis, 401-4 Hosted Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I'm with Sandra Korbelik,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| and she and I are representing the community as officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| of the Town Hall East Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| I'll give you five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| Thank you, and good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| When this billboard was put up, well, I wasn't around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| Let me start before that and give you some history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| We're going to ask you this evening to deny the renewal of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| Ms. Davis, could you lower the mic just a little bit so we can all hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| Does that sound much better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| The billboard renewal issue is much more to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| than just an advertisement on a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| We are really, our heart of the neighborhood is this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6942)|
| 1:55:51| and the neighborhood is going to ask each of you tonight to deny the renewal request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| As you probably know, Tank Strickland Park is a county park in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| Originally, as travelers came down Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| they saw dilapidated buildings, condemned buildings, mattresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| junk car parts, rats, and all that come with that type of setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| Some of you may remember it, some of you may not, but the neighborhood does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| So we're especially proud of the development now into Tank Strickland Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6984)|
| 1:56:31| The promise was to clean up that area and develop a sweet parking park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| and as they were developing the park and taking up the old asphalt that was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| they had a couple surprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| One was five gasoline storage tanks underground and the pocket park and the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7005)|
| 1:56:53| that little creek that runs through the pocket park now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| So, yes, the development was stalled and a proper environment work was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| The neighborhood is very pleased with this sweet pocket park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| but they're not pleased with the way the third partial has been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| and to start that development again is to remove this billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| so that we can go ahead with other development in Tank Strickland Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| The land was originally three partials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| and actually the day of the ribbon-cutting to open up Strickland Park on the first partial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7048)|
| 1:57:36| we were there with the ribbon-cutting, and that night I was before the commissioner asking for funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| Of course, they knew I was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| At that time, I knew all the commissioners, and I'm sorry I don't know all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| I know some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| But anyway, I think there were 14 or 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| I can't remember, but do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| There were 19 commissioners at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| and every one of them voted for us to get the money allocated to purchase that last third partial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7080)|
| 1:58:09| and I'll accept one, and, of course, I remember who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| And after the commission meeting, he did come down and apologize to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7094)|
| 1:58:22| Anyway, we're real happy with the park, and we appreciate the commission and the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| You've got something for Mr. Dellavopi, I think, in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| He states everything that I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| He worked with me right from the groundbreaking all the way through to the ribbon-cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7116)|
| 1:58:42| and Mrs. Lundy, if you would read the statement from Sam McKinsey that's in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| It says, Sharon, when we purchased and dedicated the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| we asked and were told that the lease would not be renewed after the contract period expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| I do think that takes away from the parking should come down, Representative Sam McKinsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| So we're asking you tonight to not renew the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| and let us continue to have faith in what the government tells us that they will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7148)|
| 1:59:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| I've got a request for the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| If it's Ms. Cabello would, Mr. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| Chair Spangler would like to introduce Lieutenant Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| He's our new environmental officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| He has to go, so can we do that right quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Is that okay with you, Ms. Corberley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Could we wait just for a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Chair Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Just real quick I want to introduce Lieutenant Tom Walker who will be our environmental officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| and also taking care of all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| so making sure that you reach out to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| and also will be helping out with codes and the highway department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| So with that being said, I just want to make sure that you put a name and a face together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| and what he's going to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| and hopefully we'll be able to clean up some of our areas that we have some issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| So I don't know if you have any questions of him, but if you do, if not, we'll let you continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Thank you, Lieutenant Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Ms. Sandra Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| You would say your name and your address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| I will, and congratulations on the last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| Sandra Corbelic, 5212 Daphne Drive, president of the Town Hall East Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7243)|
| 2:00:51| What you have before you is the request for a billboard lease renewal on a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7251)|
| 2:00:57| and you are aware that the commissioners involved and the community leaders involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7257)|
| 2:01:05| have all stepped forward to state that the understanding was the billboard lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| would not be renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| And Sharon forgot to mention that Tank Strickland, who was the chair of the commission at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7273)|
| 2:01:20| contacted her and stated he too remembered that the billboard was to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7280)|
| 2:01:27| I call furthermore to your attention on the site plan for the park the notation billboard to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7287)|
| 2:01:35| But I'm here to say, what if?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| What if the commission decides to renew the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| And I'd like to point out there's several topics that might come up in result of that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| The county would receive only $250 a month for the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| Tank Strickland is a very visible park with the year-round stream, playground equipment, statue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| and picnic shelters, a park that serves several hundred nearby homes and apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| Many of the Tank Strickland Park trees presently interfere with the street view of the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| I submitted photos depicting that this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| I'm not sure you had a chance to see them, but if you could take a look at your packet, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| Renewing the lease will require that these trees be substantially cut over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7343)|
| 2:02:29| to the detriment of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| What happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Knoxville City contributed, I'm going point by point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| I could go one, two, three, but I think you're catching the drift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| Knoxville City contributed $250,000 toward purchase of this property so it could be developed as a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7361)|
| 2:02:50| Perhaps the city might question why the billboard remains on park property, property that is zoned open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7370)|
| 2:02:58| Billboards are not allowed in the open space zone within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| If this billboard is allowed in this park, will a standard be set to permit billboards in other parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7383)|
| 2:03:11| or billboards appropriate in parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| The billboard was originally installed when the properties were all commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| Now the land is a park next to Burlington Library, the U.S. Post Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| Chihuahua Hills Baptist Church, and a derelict hotel which will soon be torn down and 80 apartment units developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7404)|
| 2:03:33| The county cannot control messages displayed on the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| This billboard is on county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| What if a message is posted that is seen as offensive to the community or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7422)|
| 2:03:48| The revised resolution still states a 10-year lease with a 10-year renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| This means the county would face this predicament for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7434)|
| 2:04:01| We are asking the commission to deny the billboard lease, and furthermore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| we are asking the commission to require the billboard to be removed 90 days as of this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7446)|
| 2:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| Thank you, Ms. Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| Joyce Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| My name is Joyce Feld, and I am here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7463)|
| 2:04:28| Scenic Knoxville works to enhance the beauty and visual character of our public spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| our streetscapes, and our scenic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| Parks are an especially treasured scenic resource in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| Parks provide accessible retreats from our urban bustle and the drumbeat of commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| Parks are a core civic service and do not exist to create revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| Knox County recognizes the importance of this responsibility by maintaining numerous beautiful parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| which all of us have enjoyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Anyone who had any doubts about the importance of parks in commercial-free areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| surely had their mind changed when they saw how people flocked to parks and greenways during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7506)|
| 2:05:13| Children especially deserve to play in a commercial-free zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| and to enjoy the beauty and tranquility of nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| In Tank Strickland Park, there's a sweet little playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| but looming over the playground is a giant advertisement for candy and soda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| Is this fair to the children using the playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Is it fair to the parents who brought them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| We don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| This park includes many trees, as Sandra Korbelak just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| that haven't yet achieved their full size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| The contract allows the trimming of these trees to maintain visibility of the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| These are publicly owned trees, owned by our taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| which beautify the park and provide numerous benefits to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| These trees should not be cut back to enhance commercial profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| We are concerned that approving the renewal of this lease would set an unfortunate precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| suggesting that, under the right conditions, our public parks are for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7570)|
| 2:06:15| Our zoning ordinance prohibits billboards and commercial signs in open space zones, and for good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7575)|
| 2:06:22| Scenic Knox will request that you do not approve the renewal of this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| Chair, we'll look for a motion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| I have a motion to deny the renewal of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7598)|
| 2:06:44| Deny or dismiss, whichever one's the best worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| Motion is by Commissioner Ward. Second is by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| Was there a clarification on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| The motion is to deny the renewal of this lease, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Commissioner Jay, your light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| Do you yield to Commissioner Skinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| Was I up first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| You were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Question for the lawn mower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| Was there any documentation on any agreements found in the process of the last couple weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Myers is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| He went through everything in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| There's been a lot of talk about an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| There is nothing written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| And under Tennessee law, everywhere in the United States, when it comes to real property, if it's not in writing, it doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7652)|
| 2:07:41| I'm not saying it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| I'm not saying that those representations weren't made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| I'm saying as far as a legal document, no, there is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| Follow-up question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| If a motion is made, does it also need to include a removal time period as requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7674)|
| 2:08:02| Here's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| This is not truly a renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| This is a new contract because the other contract ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| If the contract's denied, then is there a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| So they have presented this to this body for a new contract, which has this ten years or ten-year automatic renewal and these other things that are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7692)|
| 2:08:28| Technically, the way it is now, they are there on a month-to-month lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| And under Tennessee law, when you're there on a month-to-month, you give them 30 days' notice, one month's notice, to get off the property that their month-to-month lease is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7714)|
| 2:08:47| That leaves the position of now it's going to take more than they may want to contest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| They may want to argue about it in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| Assuming they don't, it's going to take more than 30 days, I would think, to take down this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| And there's another issue involved, and that is the necessity for them to take in heavy equipment that could cause another problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7742)|
| 2:09:12| That's down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| It has to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| But, yeah, as long as you give them that 30 days' notice to vacate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| Minimum 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Minimum 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| It's on a theory of a month-to-month lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| And who is the governing authority or what department would enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| That should fall to the executive, to the mayor, or through his ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| Would that be codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Codes enforcement, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| Technically, it's an executive function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| Thank you, Director Buca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Is there a representative from Lamar Advertising with us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| Just a couple of quick comments, and I appreciate the extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| I did reach out to Lamar last week and asked for some additional information, trying to better understand the business perspective side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7788)|
| 2:09:57| Received no information back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| I've been looking for more information across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| I've driven the area several times, and I have information from Mr. Dellavope and State Representative Sam McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7804)|
| 2:10:15| which I find to be both good and honorable people that put forth, including many of the people who are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| And I will be supporting the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| And in addition to that, I just want you all to know that there is a massive utility line that goes right through there that is a huge pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7824)|
| 2:10:32| that is bigger than the billboard, that has one line, one actual utility line going from one side of Asheville Highway to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7832)|
| 2:10:41| but with about 72 guide wires that hold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| It's a pretty massive structure, and so I've actually inquired with KUB on if this were to be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7844)|
| 2:10:51| would they also consider looking for an alternative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| Because it doesn't solve the problem if you take out one pole and the other pole is standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| So I don't speak for them, but at least that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| And I hope the commission will continue to support removing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| but putting an amendment of probably 90 or 120 days given the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| Commissioner Ward, your light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| You're the maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| I agree with the community and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| The thing that I've always had a problem with beginning with this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| and it's something that I want to make sure we're making note of, this is a terrible contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| The $250 amount isn't what I'm striving over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| It's the 10-year contract with an automatic renewal, locking the county in for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| I just really have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| So I would really like our department to reconsider how they're doing these kinds of contracts going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| I mean, two years at most in my personal business capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| But also I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| Hopefully we'll deny this and do what's right for the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7915)|
| 2:12:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| Yeah, I believe that this thing needs to be removed as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| and that's why I was going to ask that Commissioner Ward wanted to amend his motion to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| there would be X number of time periods that they would be allowed to remove the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| Since they're now currently paying month to month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| we also need to make sure that if the Finance Department of Knox County or the Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| who actually is receiving the revenue and registering the revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| that we no longer accept payment for this billboard after, well, it should expire this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| so that we don't collect a November or December payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| We're going to have this removed by January 1st of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| And I think that anytime you have a county park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7970)|
| 2:12:56| that it should be sacred ground to where people can go and enjoy the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| I'm kind of glad a couple months ago that I pulled this off from the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| because more details came about just because the community got to wind of what was going on and reacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7987)|
| 2:13:16| and I appreciate them coming out and supporting that the denial and removal of this billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=7996)|
| 2:13:23| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Commissioner Ward, did you want to respond to the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| Yeah, I'll amend to give it 120 days, given the holidays and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| I know from running trucks and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| it's impossible right now to get equipment and everything else that you need to get stuff done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| so 120 days I think would be fair four months from right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| Commissioner Lundy, is that agreeable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| The other thought is if they're going to have 120 days to remove the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8031)|
| 2:14:00| and if they're not paying to have a sign posted there, an advertisement posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| then the removal of the actual advertising should be prior to the removal of the whole suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8045)|
| 2:14:15| Director Book, you're talking about the number of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| but the key to this is they're on a month-to-month lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| You have to give them written notice that that month-to-month lease is terminated 30 days, one month notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8066)|
| 2:14:35| It's not 30 days, it's one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| So I think you ought to amend your motion to say that the mayor is to give them one month's notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8077)|
| 2:14:48| that the month-to-month lease they're on right now is over and done with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| and that would have to be the end of November, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| Yeah, so my thought process is 30-day notice from after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| One-month notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| One-month notice, yeah, and then 120 days until it's taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| So they have the one-month notice and then 90 days after that to actually take the structure down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| I think we probably need to look at who actually has the ownership of the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| because in some cases you own the structure, in some cases the advertising agency owns the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| depending on how old it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Some of the older wooden ones are actually owned by the people that own the original land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| Mr. Snowden, you've approached the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| Would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| Yeah, I just wanted to make note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| On billboard structures much like cell phone structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| we hold a bond in perpetuity in our office for the removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| So obviously my office and the code's office will issue a notice of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| and then should the owner of the structure choose not to comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| we actually hold a bond that we could foreclose and remove the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| Just wanted to give you a little more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| How much is the bond and how much time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| I'd have to, usually we deal with the law director's office, Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| There is some time frame obviously for the surety to weigh that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8168)|
| 2:16:13| but typically it's somewhere around 30 to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| Okay, so 120 days should be sufficient to give you enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| Yes, sir, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| I'll let Commissioner Daly speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| Okay, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| The updated resolution that we got today, I'm going to vote no, no doubt about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| but that last sentence, a term of 10 years with an automatic renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8199)|
| 2:16:44| at the sole discretion of Lamar Companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| Who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| I would like to know who amended this resolution that made them the king of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8210)|
| 2:17:01| Ours is Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| He's, I guess, it's all on your shoulders, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8222)|
| 2:17:10| Ours is Morton Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| The resolution was amended to appropriately reflect what the contract provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8232)|
| 2:17:19| When Jill drew up the resolution, I failed to notice it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8239)|
| 2:17:23| and I failed to understand the need to be in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| and Jill diligently pointed that out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| and the resolution was changed as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| Well, I'm not fussing at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| I just don't like that wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| If it came from Lamar, that's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| It's their form, and it's legal as is to form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| but this commission doesn't have to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| Commissioner Lundy, did you want to have the last word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| Commissioner Ward's last on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| I just want to thank the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| I want to thank Joyce, Sandra, Sharon, and Kevin for advocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| I love when you all come out and advocate for what you believe in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| and I just hope my commission supports the denial of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8284)|
| 2:18:09| Like they say, this was a commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| and now it's a park that's being used by the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| and this doesn't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| Commissioner Ward, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| I want to read just to clarify what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8303)|
| 2:18:44| I want to ask the maker one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| After the one-month notice, did you want to give an additional 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| It's 90 days, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| So to deny the one-month notice and then 90-day removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| The motion before us is to deny this lease agreement with Lamar Companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| for the renewable lease of a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| located on Knox County property at 4630 Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| for the mayor to give the lessee one month's notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8351)|
| 2:19:18| that the lease has been terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| and then 90 days to remove the sign from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| Now, to clarify, this is a motion to deny the renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| So if you vote yes or aye, you are voting to deny the renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| A no vote would be to vote to continue the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| So the motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| Am I correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| It was just a technical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| You said deny the renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| It's not a renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| You're denying entering into this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| because there is no written agreement to renew at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| So the motion is to deny a new lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| Do we need to state the sign and the structure be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8406)|
| 2:20:13| They could take that sign down and that structure could stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8413)|
| 2:20:19| Does the structure belong to Lamar, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8419)|
| 2:20:30| I'll just get the sign down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| I'm not specific on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| but typically the advertising agency owns the support and the sign structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8437)|
| 2:20:44| I would imagine so. That's previous practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| So the motion then is to deny this lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8448)|
| 2:20:54| for the mayor to give 30 days notice of the termination of the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| and one month notice of the termination of the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| and 90 days to remove the sign and the structure from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| For clarity, an aye vote is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| No vote is not to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8477)|

| 2:26:54| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| Mr. Mullins, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| This property is on West Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| This is in the planned growth area of our growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| The sector plan is low-density residential, which allows consideration of densities up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8828)|
| 2:27:17| The applicant originally asked for and advocated for at the Planning Commission stage for five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8837)|
| 2:27:24| Tonight, after conferring with the neighborhood, meeting more additionally with Commissioner Hill and talking to Jim Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8844)|
| 2:27:35| we're asking for an increase, a slight increase, of four dwelling units an acre for our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8855)|
| 2:27:42| The planning staff recommended 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| The Planning Commission approved 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| We are asking for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| To put that into perspective on this 8.1-acre parcel of property, that is a modest increase of four homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8868)|
| 2:27:56| from 28 allowable residences potentially to 32 potential residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8876)|
| 2:28:03| This is completely consistent with the growth policy plan being planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| It's completely consistent with the existing sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| It's completely consistent with the community and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| When you look at what is built already there in this area, you will see within a 4,000-square-foot radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8894)|
| 2:28:22| and I use that radius number because there were some examples that planning staff had looked at in their consideration of surrounding densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8902)|
| 2:28:32| You will see densities of 16 dwelling units an acre, 5 dwelling units an acre, 6 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8912)|
| 2:28:43| There's 12 dwelling units an acre with consideration up to 24 dwelling units an acre, only 600 feet east of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8923)|
| 2:28:50| So the property is consistent, what we're requesting, with the density that is allowed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8930)|
| 2:28:59| There is opposition from lazy acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| Lazy acres has some existing flooding problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| I've seen the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| The pictures, you know, do show they have some existing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| And in the record, I mean, Mr. Snowden has went out there and he's had his people go out there and look at why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8950)|
| 2:29:17| And there's some existing stormwater issues with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| They have a spillway and some culverts that do get impounded and backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8960)|
| 2:29:26| Their property is also extremely flat, flatter than what they recommend the road to be to allow stormwater to clear off of a highway that's engineered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8966)|
| 2:29:34| So there are existing issues, but we know that with the existing stormwater ordinances in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8974)|
| 2:29:41| and Mr. Snowden can speak to this if he's here, that we will be required to make sure that there is no additional runoff in this property than post-development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8981)|
| 2:29:52| than there is pre-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| He's met with the applicant, and they are committed to working with him to even try to improve that to the extent they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| So we can't promise that there will never be flooding in lazy acres because of the existing conditions at lazy acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| but we can promise to work with engineering and try to improve the situation to the extent that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| And we've met with neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| We've talked to them about that, and we've told them that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| if there's problems during the construction, call Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| You know, whatever contract we have will be bonded to make sure that they aren't causing any conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| because we don't want that to make sure that gets taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| We'll be glad to continue to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| There's concerns about the traffic and safety in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| West Millers Cove Road, it's 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| It has 70 feet of right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| In this area, it is fairly straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| There is a slight curve to the left just as you get to the west of this property that goes down the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| towards the entrance of lazy acres, and lazy acres, the entrance there, is kind of in a gully, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9054)|
| 2:31:00| It's down at the bottom of a hill and then goes back up to another hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| And we've talked to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| What can we do to make that better as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| We've talked about, you know, do they want a deceleration lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| Do they want rumble strips, rumble stripes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| And I think what the engineering is recommending is that we use our frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| our 220 feet of frontage there, to increase the width of the shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9080)|
| 2:31:26| and to make that wider so it would minimize any impact at that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| We can do that along our frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| But when we met with the neighbors a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| one of the things they asked us to consider, which is why you sit down with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| because we never would have thought of this as a possibility until they referenced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| They said, would you be willing to not access this property off of West Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| but go completely through Levi Powell Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| And because this property does share a significant adjacent property line to Levi Powell Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9114)|
| 2:32:01| and the road actually, Levi Powell Park, runs right to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| And we talked to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| They loved the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9127)|
| 2:32:08| They would like to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| We don't know if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| I've reached out to Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| I've reached out to Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| Is this something that would be considered and approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| Because right now we're only at a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| We don't have a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| We don't have a development plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| And I know Mr. Snowden was going to have conversations with Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| about whether or not that was a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| If it is, that is certainly something that we are willing to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| and willing to revise our development plan so that we don't even access West Millers Cove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| or if we can still improve West Millers Cove, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| West Beaver Creek along that frontage and still access through the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9164)|
| 2:32:50| So these are things that we are willing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| But to be able to consider that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| we have to be able to plan for these unforeseen contingencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| and that's where additional density will help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| When you look at the zoning where Lazy Acres is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| it's zoned RA, which is your general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| General residential zoning allows lot sizes as low as 10,000 square feet an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9190)|
| 2:33:17| You do the math, that's 4.356 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| Essentially four dwelling units an acre is what we are asking for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| Now, why aren't we asking for RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| Because the property has environmental conditions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| It's an odd-shaped piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| It's kind of like a bent ruler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9212)|
| 2:33:33| It's narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| And going to planned residential allows you a lot more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| in looking at smaller lot sizes and addressing some of the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| about clustering the development so you can plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| for additional stormwater considerations should they come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| but still have the same amount of density that the neighborhood beside us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| the Lazy Acres, is allowed in their current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| So we think this is completely consistent with what's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| and what could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| Again, it's in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| and we're willing to work with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9246)|
| 2:34:08| We're willing to address, to the extent we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| the conditions they're currently suffering from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| Because I've seen the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| I've seen the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| It is bad out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| And it can only improve when there are additional developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| that can come along and maybe address something upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| And so that's something we're willing to partnership with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| and partnership with the community to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| So with all respect to the recommendation of planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| for 3.5 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| we really would ask today that we increase this to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| We have Christina Fowler, who has registered for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9286)|
| 2:34:52| Mr. King, you representing the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| Sorry, I didn't sign up in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| If I had done so, I don't know if we would have everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9301)|
| 2:35:08| I'm John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9308)|
| 2:35:17| I was engaged by Tyler Smith in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9317)|
| 2:35:22| He lives in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| and that neighborhood tonight is represented by Ms. Fowler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| who's going to be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| Mr. Smith could not be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| and I ask that I at least be here to acknowledge that he is fully in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| and prefers the position of the neighborhood group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| and she will be happy to tell you what that position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| Ms. Fowler, if you will state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| My name is Christina Fowler, and my address is 7249 Evanelle Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| Sorry, am I not loud enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| Christina Fowler, and the address is 7249 Evanelle Way in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9365)|
| 2:36:09| It's a family home of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| It was built in 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| My grandparents lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| My parents lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| I live there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| I myself have been a resident there since 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9377)|
| 2:36:22| I did send out an e-mail to all of you in advance of tonight's meeting with e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9382)|
| 2:36:29| and with a copy of a map that was sent to me by Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| and also several photos from just one of our recent rains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| so you can see how bad our current flooding issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9398)|
| 2:36:42| I sort of outlaid everything that I was going to talk about tonight in that e-mail to you in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| just hoping that you would see our position and do some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| and just understand why we're here before I got up here to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| knowing I had a limited amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| And I appreciate those of you that have taken the time to respond to me with that e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9418)|
| 2:37:05| We in our subdivision just don't feel like the number of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9425)|
| 2:37:10| that are going to be put in here really does help the housing shortage or the housing crisis that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9430)|
| 2:37:16| We have subdivisions that are going in close by that have hundreds of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| and feel that those better meet the needs of our community to solve the housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9441)|
| 2:37:28| We don't feel like 30 homes is going to make that big of a difference for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| but we do feel like it would make that big of a difference in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| as far as those water issues go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| I don't know that I could do any better of a job of telling you how bad it is than Mr. Mullins did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| He did explain that we do have a lot of bad water issues in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| We don't have them fixed now, and our concern is that it's going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| And while I realize that they say that they're not going to be allowed to make it worse, I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9473)|
| 2:38:00| but where's the burden of proof for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| I kind of feel like that's going to fall on us homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| and how do we get up here and prove, yes, you've made it worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| I mean, we know it'll be worse if we're living there day and night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| and the water used to come up to this side of the house and now it's coming up further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| but where are we going to be left if we can't prove that they're making it worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| So that is our burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| So I ask that you think about that in knowing that they can't make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9507)|
| 2:38:35| We, of course, have a drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| Even today, this afternoon, I was home today and it rained and our roads are completely flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| I could have taken and sent more pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| but they're all going to look the same as the ones that I've already sent out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| It's just a huge concern that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| And also, I mean, my property directly backs up to this proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| and I can't imagine that new homeowners moving in would be happy purchasing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| that are going to sit in as much water as ours sit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| So that's obviously the drainage situation is obviously one of our biggest concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9544)|
| 2:39:13| And also the line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| I know that they've mentioned that they're working on potentially resolving those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| but right now we don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| We're at the bottom of two blind hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| There are signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9565)|
| 2:39:26| There are flashing lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| It suggests the speed limit to be 30 miles an hour when you're coming down both sides of those hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| I can tell you with the amount of traffic that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| and the amount of commuters that we have that use West Beaver Creek every morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| as a cut through to get to West Knoxville and Farragut, that speed limit's not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9580)|
| 2:39:45| There's never anybody out there from Knox County patrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9585)|
| 2:39:49| There's never anybody pulled over for speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9589)|
| 2:39:53| There have been 43 crashes there in the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| There's a cross that we pass every day as we leave the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| and we're reminded of families that have lost loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| We also have a school bus that stops at the entrance of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| at the bottom of these two blind hills to let the kids out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| So what we don't want to see is two entrances beside each other competing in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| going left and right, more struggles for the kids getting on the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| and also more potential for accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| It's a huge concern because they don't have the line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| If they did have to take some trees down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| there may be trees that are on another neighbor's lot that they could take down to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| but that would mean that that neighbor has to agree to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| and who knows if they're going to allow their trees to be removed for this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| for the line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9643)|
| 2:40:44| The property that they're looking at coming in off of Levi Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| we ourselves, when we tried to purchase this property some time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| also inquired about coming in off of Levi Field and told that that wasn't an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9653)|
| 2:40:59| It was a donated property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| They donated it for the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| and they didn't want a road for a residential area coming in off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| And also, that's just another issue with the kids at Levi Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| We have kids that, you know, right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| they do cross through this property from our subdivision to go play at the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| and obviously there are concerns there if there's a road in of them getting hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| when they're walking over and riding their bikes over to the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| We know that we're number 60 out of 554 roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| and I realize that that's not the worst on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| I realize we're down there on the list, but still 60 out of 554.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| I still think we're in a pretty bad situation where we are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| and just don't need that additional traffic coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9706)|
| 2:41:53| Regardless of what goes on here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| we're requesting that you, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| don't allow that many houses to come in and develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| and we feel like there's issues with the sightline, issues with the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| and not sure that they can be resolved with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| and not sure that they can be made better with the initial concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| And I realize that they haven't spent a lot of money up front to research this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| and they don't want to, and I understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| It might not work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| But I'm asking you to please listen to what the homeowners that have lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| myself for 40 years, and the others have to say and look at our photos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9748)|
| 2:42:34| and see our situation as it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| and see our point of view that this could potentially make it a lot worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| for the drivers in and out and for the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| that already experience bad flooding in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| So I would respectfully ask that you allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| no more than two to three homes per acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| Thank you, Ms. Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| Any questions or discussion from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| Mr. Snowden, can you help us better understand the flooding issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9783)|
| 2:43:08| in Lazy Acre Way, and is that something that's been going on for quite some time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9788)|
| 2:43:16| Is it because of a topography issue or retention ponds that weren't in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9796)|
| 2:43:22| Yeah, I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| I was looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| Lazy Acres, I was looking at the plat when it was originally created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| Obviously, at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| our stormwater standards were very different than they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9814)|
| 2:43:38| That's an older subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| It's probably, and Ms. Fowler might be able to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| She said early 70s, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9823)|
| 2:43:46| Yeah, 1976 is the plat date here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| So obviously stormwater standards were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| the thought was to get water off the street as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| In this situation, there isn't any catch basins in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9838)|
| 2:44:01| There are no retention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| It pretty much, you know, flows from the roofs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| and the hard surfaces into the drainage ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| The properties, the drainage way that is in reference here is very flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9850)|
| 2:44:16| It's essentially about 600 feet long, and it's about 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| So even under ideal or best conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| it's going to be very hard to move water out of there quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| So, yeah, I mean, a combination of just a lot of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| do create issues where we have issued a work order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9872)|
| 2:44:37| There is, I guess, the spillway is silted up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| so there is some improvements we could do within the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| to get the water off the road a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| But once it gets off the road, the profile is going to be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| But we're certainly going to do some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| within the right-of-way in the very near future to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| And then the second question is, I'm looking at the map right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| and it looks like Martingale is the drive that is—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| it actually has several residences on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| and then it certainly attaches and loops around through the park as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| Can you address the idea of having access restricted to Martingale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| instead of West Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| I mean, it looks like a standard drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| until you get virtually right on the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| Yeah, I think there's pros and cons with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| Obviously, we do want to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| it's always best to limit access points and conflict points on any roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| so there's a benefit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| I have reached out to Joe at Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| I haven't had a chance to actually speak with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| But as this lady mentioned, oftentimes there are land-use restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9946)|
| 2:45:50| There would have to be quite a bit of what appears to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9950)|
| 2:45:54| mature vegetation removed to construct that access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9954)|
| 2:45:59| And I'm sure some of the folks at Martingale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| they potentially may not like that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9962)|
