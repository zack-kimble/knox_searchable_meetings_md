| 0:01:00| and turn it over to the experts, because I'm far from an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| Thank you all for taking the time today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| and to hear more about the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| and amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| As you are aware, the growth policy process is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| A little history of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| After an attempt to amend the plan in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| we listened to feedback and began the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| in creating our first comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| and transportation plan, and reconvening the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| committee was the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| We proposed an amendment based on the data gathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| from the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| The committee reconvened in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| and held its final meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| There were four public meetings, and many of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| here were in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| We heard from presidents and members of all bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=105)|
| 0:01:52| requesting additional changes to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| We carefully considered their request, made a few edits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| and presented a final amendment, which was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| at the January 10th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| There are members from the leadership team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| here today to give a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| and answer any questions you may have regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| the plan and the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| And we would appreciate your support and help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| in moving this plan forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| And I'm going to turn it over now to our presenting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Hi, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| OK, so I'm going to start off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| We want to start off talking about our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| and how they relate to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| So we're going to start off talking about the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| plan, which is really why we're here, what it does and doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| do, and put it into context with the other tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| that we have to consider land use and future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| and development in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| So this is one of three documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| that we'll touch on, like I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| I want to start by talking about the purpose of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| which is to establish three areas, urban growth, plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| growth, and rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Of all the documents that we're going to go over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| this one is the most general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| And so when it pops back up, this will make more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| So reading this map does not tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| that everything in yellow that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| is going to be suburban residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| or that every parcel in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| is a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| What it does tell us that the areas in yellow, there it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| I'll pause for just a minute so you all can see the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=212)|
| 0:03:43| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=223)|
| 0:03:53| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=234)|
| 0:03:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| So what it does tell us that those areas in yellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| have been identified as places that future growth could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| be accommodated over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=244)|
| 0:04:04| Now we're going to talk about what the growth policy does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=247)|
| 0:04:07| Director Brooks, can I interrupt just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| Can we back up for a quick second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| because just making sure we all understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| the growth policy plan is a plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| was initiated in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| But maybe, I know we're going to get into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| hey, we've got this urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| We've got the planned growth area, the rural growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| But what was the reason that the state required the localities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| to go into it to produce these growth policy plans in 2001?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| I think that might help us as we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| kind of putting this whole thing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Well, Public Chapter 1101 was initiated in, actually, 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| There was concern over, well, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| was a number of different concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| One, I think, that's talked about most frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| and is most predominant is unchecked annexations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| that were happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| But also, to think about the rapid growth at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| I think the statistics as quoted as Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| was 13th in population growth at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| And sprawl was a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| And so those are just some of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| it was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| So was it part of looking at, we've got a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| we've got unincorporated county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| We've got city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| We've got town of Farragut all in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| And so obviously, as one part of that develops, it affects others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| So was it kind of to promote smart growth, in a sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| And encourage jurisdictions to coordinate with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=343)|
| 0:05:43| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| I think I was hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| So what does it not do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| It doesn't rezone someone's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| It does not dictate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| But like I said a minute ago, it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| identify places where future growth could go in years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| And it doesn't make someone use their property differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| or make them sell their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| If someone is farming on their property right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| that process does not change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| So now I want to touch on the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| or general plan, as it's called currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| The purpose of the plan is to provide recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| for land use and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| It outlines policies and guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| on how future growth in the unincorporated county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| can be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Again, I want to make sure that you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| this is couched in the advanced NOx process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| It was the county's initiative to update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| land use, transportation in the unincorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| So the creation of this plan is really how we got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| The process has taken place over the last two plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| It's involved a lot of data analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| of where and how the county could accommodate growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| And we've received input from thousands of community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| So this helps us go from the general question of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| can growth be accommodated, that we are answering to the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| policy plan, to what types of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| are appropriate in these different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| This is the point where we can begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| to understand where and what scale residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| might occur or where a commercial center might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| And it is important to note that there are places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| with rural character found throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| not just in these rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| So again, when you look at this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| you're able to see much more nuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| and can identify what places, even those within the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| growth area, that are anticipated to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| more rural in character, and which areas are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| appropriate for just traditional style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| development, suburban development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| and where we might see more intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Those are things that you can't determine just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| by looking at the growth policy map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| but can begin to understand through the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| I want to emphasize that the comprehensive plan map, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| we refer to as the future land use map or the FLUM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| was created first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| And that all the input that I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| that we've received over the last two plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| we took all that, and then the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| took these growth policy boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| and brought them into alignment with the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| And finally, we have the zoning ordinance and map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| This document takes the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| from the comprehensive plan and defines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| what is legally allowed at the parcel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| It is the most detailed and defined tool that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| But I want to be clear, right now what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| is not the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| This document will have to be updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| if the county's comprehensive land use and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| We know that both the separation and coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| among these three documents can be confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| as Chris mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| But it's really important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| that they're all closely linked and built upon each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| And this slide is just a recap, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| went over at a very high level what the growth policy plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| It determines rural plan growth and urban growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| The comprehensive plan gets into more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| It provides land use and transportation policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| and action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| And then the zoning ordinance regulates land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| at the parcel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| And now I'm going to turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| to the county's director of engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Jim Snowden, to review the proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| to the growth policy plan and discuss next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I don't get the chance to visit with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| like Amy does on a monthly basis, so it's nice to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| As Amy said, I'm Jim Snowden, director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| of engineering public works for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| My role in this process, just a little higher background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| is the things, the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| that come out of planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| are enforced by my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| So that's the kind of role that engineering public works plays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| much like Tom Clabo in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| I wanted to go through just generally what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| we have proposed as text amendments and map amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| and kind of how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Generally, on the text amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| we wanted to provide a lot more clarity and specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Obviously, that plan was generated in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| lots changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| So a couple of things as we went through that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| was the existing development on steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| was codified for only certain zones and certain slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| of greater than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| This particular text amendment here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| codifies it such that rezoning on slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| shall be based on the adopted policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| of each legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| So that's regardless of zone and regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| of the steepness of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| So the recommendations that come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| of Amy's body in regard to density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| as it relates to steep slopes will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| be forwarded to the county commission body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Once again, just a little more specifics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| In the 2000 plan, the allowed zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| were ag, state, open space, floodway, and planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| In the new plan, as proposed for y'all's consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| we have three different place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| These place types really kind of hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| align more of the rural feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| I think you have a handout of those place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| rural conservation, rural crossroads, and rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| It's our hope with those that we, as those rural places do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| develop, they develop in a fashion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| respects the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| A lot of words here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| This is particularly just kind of breaks down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| into where we want to see development occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| in the rural area currently, and that's on the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| but I'll kind of preempt that a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| is currently the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| says that you can have up to two dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| units an acre in the rural area, but you can go up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| if you have adequate sewer and establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| that the roadway infrastructure from the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| to the planned growth area is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| We wanted to put some additional restrictions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| That's one of the things that we felt like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| heard throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| So we have capped that now at two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| And in addition to obtain that two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| you have to have sewer service or the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| to install a private sewer service that then will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| be maintained by a public utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| as well as an additional restriction such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| that the road must be 18 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| or be brought to 18 feet wide and on a major or minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| collector or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Like I said, that's something we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| really excited about in the sense of that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| will align our commitment to have growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| where adequate infrastructure exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| That's one of the things we heard a lot about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I kind of jumped ahead a little bit on that next slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| so we can actually jump to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| This is essentially, as of the effective date of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| all previously approved densities in rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| shall remain in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Essentially what that says, it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| your grandfathered your zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Obviously, we didn't want to take away any existing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| rights that folks may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| So if you're in the county now in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| and you're zoned at PR3, obviously, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| wouldn't obtain that PR3 in today's times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| if this plan's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| But you would retain that zoning and that density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| and that property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| The next obvious part of that is the growth policy map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| We and Amy's kind of, I think, showed that map previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| But we want to talk a little bit about why we did what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| and where we chose to grow and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| try to do it in a very objective manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| The property increase, or pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| the increase of the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| that you'll see on the next slide is a 7% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| So the planned growth areas established in the 2000 plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| and the plan we're proposing to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| is a 7% increase in landmass area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| Those expansion areas, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| we considered very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| We wanted to make sure that they aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| with the either existing or proposed infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| including schools, water and sewer, and roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Because we all know those three things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| drive land development throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| So we wanted to be very sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| And we had folks, we had actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| technical committees that met multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| with just those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Utility managers, Tom Clabo, Harold Cannon, those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| and just really made sure that those things aligned closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Another thing we wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| was also be very fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| That's one of the things that Mayor Jacobs wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| And the fiscal analysis that we did as part of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| showed that we looked at varying scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| And the scenario that we ultimately ended up choosing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| we felt like aligned these priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| But it also gave us the ability to, in the status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| we were essentially losing money every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| The cost of service was revenue net negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| And under this scenario, we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| have a go to a positive net increase of about $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| versus a $4 million loss, so a $6 million net increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| to the county taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| So with that, the map that you see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| is the proposed map that will be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| by all legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| We grew the planned growth area in five specific areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| Two of those, relatively small, so we won't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| highlight those, but we'd be happy to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| a little more detail with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| One of those is on Straw Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| pretty much right adjacent to the city boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| there at the FBI station, or the TBI station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| The other location is in Carnes at Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| at the Carnes Sports Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Those are very small locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| The three large locations that we expanded were along Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| The first one was along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Obviously, if you drove out Chapman Highway in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| this particular corridor is under construction now by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| It's four lane with really no shoulders, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| kind of narrow lanes, no turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| So the state is building a center turn lane through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| adding just a lot of improvements in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| in addition to some utility expansion that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| ongoing out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| So we did make an expansion here to align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| with that improved roadway infrastructure and utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| infrastructure upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Obviously, the second one is everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| very familiar with the growth at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| This is one that, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| we're probably a little bit reactive on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| But we do have plans in place to widen Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| We do have plans in place to partner with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| to expand the interchange of Watt Road at I-40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| and expand Everett Road into the west side of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| West Knox Utility District has recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| upgraded their sewer plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| So there's just a ton of capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| out there in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| So we do want to expand there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| But you'll notice that expansion only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| goes a certain distance off of that main roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| We still wanted to protect those rural environments out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| So once again, that was very thoughtfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| done to make sure that those rural places were preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| And the last map amendment we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| is kind of in the RIDD community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| If you know where the RIDD Elementary School is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| this is generally in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Obviously, I think you guys later on today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| are going to consider some expenditures of city funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| for the expansion of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| That's a project we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| We also looked at the redundancy in the transportation network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| through this area gives us a lot of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| You have Tazewell Pike, Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Millertown Pike, Rutledge Pike, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| a lot of roads running north and south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| like McGinnis and Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| So we are embarking on a transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| study for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Because unlike the Hardin Valley community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| before we were proposing this growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| we want to have a transportation plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| to implement projects before the problem persists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| So this is something that you'll see in our capital plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| coming up this year and the next following years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| that you'll see projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Yes, Council Aide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| What are the bounds for your transportation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| that you're talking about there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| It will include everything within the expanded boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| here, as well as just pretty much the entire 8th Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| District, if anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| We'll look at a lot of different intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| that may even be outside this area from a safety perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| But this particular expansion will focus directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| on the capacity of the roadway network within this expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Just staying on transportation, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Related to Chapman Highway and all of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| where there are state highways, is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| aligned with the TDOT's most recent 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| How does that sync or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Well, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| There was some conversations about the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| There were some projects that were pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| So there is some concern there that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| working with TDOT on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| I ain't going to say that there's not major concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| but there are some things that the state did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| as part of that plan that we want to revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| And they're going to update it yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| But yes, I would say it aligns with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| But obviously, it's still an ongoing conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Are there areas of growth here that are contingent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| upon the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| I wouldn't say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Most of the projects that we are contemplating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| or the projects we contemplated with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| were already projects that were either underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| like Chapman Highway or some other areas like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| So we didn't feel like that the release of that 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| would create undue stress on any of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Director Snowden, while we're on the subject of traffic and road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| improvements, does this proposal remove engineering studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| from future growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1225)|
| 0:20:25| We still will work with the current standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| that, much like you guys work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| anything that generates more than 700 trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| will receive a level one traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| I thought that it removed traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| from extended growth in rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Oh, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| There is a comment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Councilperson Roberto, that goes back to that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| I don't know if we can go back to that particular slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| It was the slide I think I skipped, Mandy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| where it talks about the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| In this particular location, you received two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| an acre somewhat by right in the growth policy plan of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| And then you could get that additional one dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| unit an acre if you did a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| So seeing as how we backed the density back to two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| we did remove the requirement for the traffic study for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| because we're not giving them that extra lot density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| So when you're looking at future road improvements or traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| in the rural area, you don't have to do a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| The reason we did that was because we reduced the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| to the point that we feel like that shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| create a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| No, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Sorry, Mandy, I made you jump back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| And I think we're to the last slide, which is our next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Obviously, we presented this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| to county commission last evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Certainly glad to present it to you guys tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| We are going to do something similar, I think, with town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| And then county commission will consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| this at their regular meeting in the end of this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| on in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| It's our hope to get this in front of your body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| for consideration if county commission does approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| that on March 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| And then the board of aldermen will consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| at the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| So we, once again, just appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| you all's input, support, and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| happy to answer any questions you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| or provide any additional assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I'll open the floor to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| for additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| OK, this, I don't know who this is for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| but as a former person that sat on the board of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| how, schools always come last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| Was that, I know you said you consulted with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| and how that kind of factors in, because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| building a school before the child is even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| born for an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| And that's typically where most of the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| comes is as we move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| It's younger families a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| and then there's the need for the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| How does that play into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| I mean, that's just a broad hypothetical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| And what kind of, will this improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| the county and the board of education's coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| for funding the building of a new school in plenty of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| And I'll jump in, and some of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| may want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| But I think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| One of the things that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| under Superintendent Roswick's leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| is their new chief operating officer, Garfield Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| and I meet quarterly to talk about these transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1450)|

| 0:24:16| Because obviously, we had one a while back in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| community where it was an unenforced situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| they sited a school without really consulting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| And so I think this particular administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| is much more agreeable to that, and Garfield has committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| And we do meet quarterly to discuss those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So hopefully, there will be some improvement with that, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| It's also financial, because it's a big tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| expense to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| And that would be more my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| is that we budget appropriately for that type of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| And they were, much like we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| those utilities and engineers were on those subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| The school system was also on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| And one of the things that we asked them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| was to look at these maps of planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| and make sure that the schools that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| were zoned within those areas had the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| or had the potential for that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Or could at least have room for portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Director Snowden, I had a follow-up question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| I want to go back on the discussion we were having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| about hillside ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| Currently, hillside ridgetop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| is not mandatory outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| It's only mandatory in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| And in the discussion we had, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| showed some text amendments early in the screens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| what I remember seeing is that there was amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| to the growth policy plan removing language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| about hillside and slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| It looked like, and I just want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| to correct me if I'm wrong, but it looked to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| like you removed the language about rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| on slopes of 25% or more shall be limited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| and that goes on and talks more about specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| So you look to me like you're removing that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| and replacing it with rezoning of slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| shall be based on the adopted policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| of each legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Did I get that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Yes, I wanted to verify, because oftentimes I'm up here speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| but the good folks back here are doing a lot of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| so I just wanted to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| I absolutely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| I mean, this is a large document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| so I appreciate you guys coming and talking to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| about this again and giving the level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Because I know we've had these discussions before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| as early on, as you were kind of looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| how do we plan this, who are we going to talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| So no, I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| That's an important thing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| from council's perspective, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| had done a lot of work on hillside and ridgetop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| and so I just wanted to better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| what you were doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| But the county has not passed any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| of mandatory hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| We have not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| OK, so the language about adopted policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| of each legislative body, there is no hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| It serves as an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Amy's group make recommendations on the density based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| and those recommendations are forwarded to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| But you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| They can be amended at that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| In addition to that, although it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| adopted by county commission, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| look at the comprehensive plan, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| was in the document that informed this planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| we actually created a new rural place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| which is in your handout, called rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| So the rural conservation place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| we have actually placed on areas of significant hilltops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| ridgeside, ridgeside, ridge, some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| I always get that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Yeah, ridges, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| So we consciously located those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| and placed that place type on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| So what that does is actually encourage clustered development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| So although very similar to hillside ridgetop protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| where you're clustering density in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| that have less environmental constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| In addition, this also allows us to acknowledge the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| that the hillside ridgetop protection plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| in place in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Well, and there's several documents that we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| And so just for clarity, the proposal that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and that council will eventually vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| will take Knox County out of the Knoxville-Knox County general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| plan that is dated 2033, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| So the comprehensive plan is just for the unincorporated areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| So that will apply there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| And then one we were just hearing from the previous speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| a reference to the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| City council will have no vote on the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| That's the county only, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| I'll ask one more question, unless my colleagues have one to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Either for Director Snowden or Mr. Caldwell, just out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| I think one of the reasons you mentioned updating the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| you're both excited about whatever questions came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| One of the comments you made was around operating overall development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| at a loss, and that this change would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| for a more financially stable footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Is it tied to an index of any kind in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| to keep up with inflation or other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| Or is this an iterative thing that is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| done as needed over the course of a decade or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| And I don't know if I can answer that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| It's more about the type of development as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| regard to the place types that were assigned in those grids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| But we can follow up with our financial consultant that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| Nitigrit was their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| They did a fiscal analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Certainly don't want to give you bad information or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Yeah, we can follow up and get you a more specific answer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| But I did hear you right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| One of the goals of this is to get development more financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| on the positive side than operating at a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1853)|
| 0:30:53| And obviously, the goal, too, is to reduce that sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| and have more condensed development to where we can ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| serve those customers better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| Mr. Snowden, I think I already know the answer to the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| that I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Back to the traffic study, the northern part of my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| has some serious issues, Wash Pike, Millertown, Broadway, Tazewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| And you mentioned doing a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And I will say, there was a traffic study for those areas of my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| 4th District, Fountain City over to Wash Pike in the city, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| It doesn't pertain to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And COVID squashed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| And we had to go with a scaled back budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| And it was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Because I think data really helps drive planning for traffic projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| So you talked about doing some study areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| or to do an area up there in the expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Do you ever do anything in tandem with the city in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| I'm assuming the way it's been done in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| when we've done it in the past in my time on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| is we approve a consultant and we pay an outside firm to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| Is that the same way that you would do it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| We're working with the firm right now, CDM Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| to kind of hone that scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| CDM Smith, actually, you guys are probably well familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| You have a very, very good traffic team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And I'd be happy to work with Tom and his group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| and hopefully maybe use an economy of scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| to bring in some of that city data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Because you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| We want to be as objective as we can with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| And so I don't care a bit if you'd like me to work with Tom and see if there's a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| If you could get him to put it in the budget, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I'll ask him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Me and him talked about Washington Pike earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| So certainly, I'll make that offer and see if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| any options for them to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1982)|
| 0:33:02| And I think my areas of concern right this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| are more Jacksboro and Tazewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| So I didn't know how much you were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| But I just wondered if we'd done anything jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| I didn't know if TPO looked at those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| But we have some major issues up there and lots of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| And yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2000)|
| 0:33:20| Yeah, we've done those things in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| and certainly be willing to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| I will let him know in our next meeting that you've committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| So you keep trying to leave, and I keep bringing you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| I think Amy's better to answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| I'll offer it up to whoever wants to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| So in a conversation you and I started with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| we talked about density and considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| And you mentioned that in the rural growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| it was two units per acre, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| I may have said that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| But there was consideration for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| In the other two areas, which would be urban growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| and planned growth, is there any consideration to density there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| And this may be a better Amy question, but I'll give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| Really for us, we're going more towards really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| the form of what fits on that particular site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| rather than Amy doesn't like the word density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| I love it personally, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| But I think we want to focus more in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| about what appropriate form of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| will fit within that land mass, rather than focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| on just a specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Is that the place type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Is that what you're talking about, where you're referencing place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| instead of density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2093)|
| 0:34:53| But so then it would be correct that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| no consideration for density in urban growth or planned growth areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| only in rural growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| Better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2103)|
| 0:35:03| That's getting out of my wheelhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I can speak briefly to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| So currently, I mean, we still have the county zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| and it is very focused on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| So the planned residential zone is similar to the city's old RP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| the zones, which relies on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| So at least for the next couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| obviously, like I mentioned, the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| what you can do on your property is driven by zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| But the document itself doesn't reference density at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| The growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| It does for the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| It does for the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| But not for the planned growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| But not for the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2144)|
| 0:35:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| And then you mentioned, I think, did you mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| planned residential in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Yes, that's a zone that's used in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| But we don't have that in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2155)|
| 0:35:55| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2156)|
| 0:35:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| All right, seeing none, we'll adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Thank you, members of the county and planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| who took time out of your evening to come present this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| I believe council will vote on this matter first on March 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Paid attention correctly to the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| So we'll probably see all of you again then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| Just a reminder for council, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| going to roll over to the large assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| and get a group photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| So Terry Knott, yeah, maybe five minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240206-growth-policy-plan?start=2190)|
