| 0:04:55| How long ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| We have this down as a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Is that correct, Wolfie, in your records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| It's been within three years, but I think it's been over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Okay, so you have it down for a second offense, but you don't recall the date of the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:24| offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=324)|

| 0:05:27| No, I'm speaking to the officer, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| We wouldn't ask you to testify against yourself in that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| The clerk's office should have it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| Apparently, they likewise don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| If you'd like, I can make a call back to my office and get the date if you want to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:50| for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Is that the pleasure of the commission, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| I think it would be very helpful in what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| All right, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=358)|

| 0:06:45| of beer to our underage people that went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| I sent an underage officer in first in plain clothes, and Mr. Lively did check his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| And about four or five minutes later, I sent the underage people in, and they did check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| Ms. Lively checked the ID, and they did sell the beer anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=429)|

| 0:07:29| Do you admit or deny the defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=449)|

| 0:08:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Not as far as selling beer, it's hard to fire your wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| Some of us might like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| Just kidding, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| It cost them more than $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| But I have dismissed her from serving beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| And she, at a later time, is going to take her tips course over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| And trust me, she hurt a lot worse for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| me than if I was just an employer and an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| Mr. Brommett, did the 21-year-old, the legal person, buy the pitcher of beer and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| underage person come in and drink the beer, or did the underage person buy the pitcher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| of beer with the adult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| I sent the officer in three minutes, maybe five minutes before I sent three people in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| my underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| When he goes in, they check his ID, Mr. Lively does, and then his wife goes over and checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| the ID of my three underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| All three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| All three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| He really got a break because I only wrote a citation for serving one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| They did set three cups down, she did, and had a pitcher of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| Was the bill paid for the pitcher ahead of the underage people coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Have to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| We never paid for the beer that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| We didn't pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| Was there a second pitcher when the kids come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| I think that's your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| I'm trying to get the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| I'm all against, everybody knows I'm all against selling underage, but if we sent the 21-year-old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| the legal person in, and they ordered the pitcher, and then the clerk, or the server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=598)|
| 0:10:08| Mr. Law Director, what's the requirement of the server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Before she gives them a cup, does she check her ID, or where are we on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Well, I believe you should check the identification of anybody who is going to consume on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| premises, and it appears in this instance, she did, albeit not successfully enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| They weren't sitting at the same table, were they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| They weren't at the same table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| When the first officer went in, we did that for the protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Of our clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| So they were at separate tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| But they were at separate tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| He ordered a Bud Light in a bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| And they ordered a pitcher of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| I'm clear then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Mr. Lively, does your wife, is she considered a part owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:56| In this business, or is her name attached to the license, to the beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| I'm on the beer permit by myself, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Mr. Lively, how long have you been in business there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| About two months, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Who else, how many employees do you have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| It's pretty much me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Except for the night your wife was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| She has her own job and she works 40 miles from there and half the time not even around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| because of her own job and another small business that we have that she works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| But she was helping me out then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Since they said they never paid for it, was it actually sold or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| Once the IDs were checked or if they weren't checked and they set the alcohol in front of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| set them down, it could have been like a restaurant going in and pay your bill as you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| They didn't ask for the money, so they assumed that they would pay for the beer when they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:14| Did they actually drink it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| Negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| What type of license do they have on or on and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| On premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Just on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| I'll make a motion that we have a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension up to the Mr. Lively there per our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Then properly moved that we give them a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Also our standard requirement of a letter of remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Sir, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| One, the commission has given you the opportunity to either pay a fine or suffer a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| Which is your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| On the way out, you'll be advised as to when and where you should pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| But you should pay it within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I suggest you pay it as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Secondly, the commission is going to want to know what steps you're going to take in the future to preclude this from happening again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| because you'll notice that second offenses can be harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| That being the case, within 30 days, please send a letter to the commission outlining what steps you plan to take to remedy this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| so it doesn't occur in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Any other questions, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=834)|

| 0:14:17| On July 24, 2009, we conducted an underage beer sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| And at the raceway station, 8605 Asheville Highway, our underage person went in and bought a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:36| They did check ID and still sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=876)|

| 0:15:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=915)|

| 0:15:25| Since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=925)|

| 0:15:30| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| What was the disposition of this one as far as was it you or another employee or who did the selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| By myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| You did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| You looked at the license and still sold it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Yeah, but I checked the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| You know, I thought it's a cigarette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| You know, we have two dates, so I write the cigarette date on the top and the beer on the lower, so that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:59| You do know that if they're underage, they have a strip down the edge of their license, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Did it have a strip down the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Did his have a strip down the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Yeah, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| But you still sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Does your register, do you have to run your license through the register to sell, or are you just plinking in the register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=979)|
| 0:16:27| No, just the plain register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Just look and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| When you look at it and you admit that there's a strip on the edge and you still sell, that's pretty bad to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:46| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Mr. Law Director, him being a part owner, and I assume his name is on the license itself, if he is found guilty of selling beer to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1008)|
| 0:17:01| does that not put his license in jeopardy by admitting that guilt here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Generally, before it gets to us, it's already been through the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| I don't know what the disposition of that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Well, I'm not sure about that because we've had cases here before where they have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Sir, have you been through the adjudication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| Have you been before a judge about and been sentenced for selling to a minor yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| Have you had to go to court on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| And what was the outcome of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| They give you another date for September 2nd, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| It's got to be a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| So I guess, Mr. Law, where does it put this gentleman and their license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| Because we ask if they've ever been found guilty of certain crimes before we grant them a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| Well, at this point, apparently he has a court date of September 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| If he admits it here today, it's probably admissible to evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| However, this is an administrative hearing and we're permitted to make those inquiries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| It's a separate adjudicatory body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| He doesn't have to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| He's chosen to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Well, I was just trying to make sure that we're giving this gentleman his rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| and what are the consequences of him admitting today to this instead of waiting until after he's had his day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| You can certainly defer it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| I just have a problem when it's the owner and they could possibly lose their license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| that they probably he needs to have his day in court, I think, before we decide what to do here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| I don't want to violate any possible due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| Are you making a motion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I'm going to make a motion that we defer this until January since you said you have a December court date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Then let's hear it in September then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| You want to defer it 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Let's defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| What's the status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| I'm, again, new to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| What's the status of his license from now to that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| He continues on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| He continues on, but there are certain ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| If he's, when the owner is found guilty of selling beer to a minor, they could lose their license more than just being fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| But the court won't entertain the license aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| The court's going to restrict itself to whether or not they feel that there's evidence to convict him of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| and then the court will either do everything from give him a pre-trial diversionary program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| where he will not get a criminal record all the way up to adjudicating him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| But we can't predict at this point what it will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| That's why I asked for the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| Do you have something, Commissioner Kearns, on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| I just wanted to know, does he understand the strip on the driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| I know we have a picture of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Could you all make sure that he understands that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| And have you been through the serving training, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| We have a motion on the floor to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I was wanting to ask Wolfie here a question about these driver's licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| Let me finish it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Anyone oppose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| On this red strip on this driver's license, if someone applies for their driver's license when they're 20 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| it would have that red strip on it, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Yes, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Well, it would be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| How long are driver's licenses good for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Four to eight years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| If they turn 21 today and they went and got a driver's license Friday, they would have the red strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| But in the red strip, it would say under 21 until today's date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| I believe that's what this gentleman was talking about when he said he looked at the date wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| In other words, that red strip, like if I got my driver's license today and I was 20 years of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| it would say in there when my license expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| He's not selling me beer before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Even though it's my 21st birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| But just looking at that red strip doesn't always, a person could be illegal sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I believe he said he looked at the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| All of your intermediate driver's licenses, anyone that you would give from the age 16 up until you turn 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| would have the red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| And that's the reason why when you go into these stores, it says if you were born before this date, you can't buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| They have these little calendars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| I just want everybody to know here that red strip does not always cure the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| They can still look at the date wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Can I make another statement about the court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| I mean, it's possible that even the September 3rd will not be heard on that particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| We can defer it again if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Wolfie, do you have the capability of letting the board know in advance that when we have these set for hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| to determine whether or not the person appearing before us is actually the person who sold the beer and what their court date is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| do you have that capability to discern that so we don't replicate this in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| Usually after the sting operation, it's usually brought before the board the next month as far as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:41| because we find we get so far behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| And the criminal adjudication usually takes, I mean, anywhere from six months to a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| We're still adjudicating cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| We had, you know, back last year, I've still got a couple pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| We're going to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Sir, we're going to have to hear this next month until your court case is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| So you'll be back next month and you can talk to the folks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| and they'll tell you what date you need to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| And Wolfie, do you have the information on Angie's market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| We've heard that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| October 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| October 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I mean, I'm sorry, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| October 8th was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| October 8th of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| That was the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| October 08, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| So it's less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Mr. Lampkin, come back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Okay, ma'am, you've heard the testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Do you admit or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| You admit it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Were you the seller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| How long have you been in business there, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Did we say that a while ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Can you tell the commission the status of the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| He no longer works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| What's the standard second offense, $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| $1,000 or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| 60 days, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Make a motion for $1,000 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| And the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| And the letter of compliance after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Ma'am, you've had two here in about, what, about nine, ten months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| And I'm not so sure that if you come up for a third time, this board is going to be as forgiving as even if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1493)|
| 0:25:04| we're not very forgiving today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| Ms. Lampkin, what this letter needs to state is what you're doing to stop this in the future, your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| You need to send it to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Send it to the commission office, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| How many people do you have there serving in your place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| You know, business owners spend a lot of money sending these folks up to get these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:45| Some of us have been talking about, we had a meeting here a couple of weeks ago about some of the problems we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| And when you invest a lot of money in them and you fire them the first time off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1551)|
| 0:26:00| I'm not so sure that's the best action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| I would think if that person goes to court and is fined for doing that and you've got to come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| that that's going to make them double aware the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| So there's a possibility you might be doing yourself a favor if they're a decent employee of keeping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| and, you know, both learning from the experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| I mean, that's just one thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| We have a motion on the floor to give them a $1,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Ma'am, you'll have a choice of a 60-day suspension of the license or a fine in the amount of $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| The fine, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| The folks to your left and my right will assist you in telling you when and where you need to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| We need to have it paid within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Failing to do so could result in a harsher penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| 5D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Raceway number 6759, 9002 Oak Ridge Highway, Hassan A. Sadeq, S-A-D-I-Q, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:27| On July 16, 2009, conducted an underage beer sting at the Raceway 9002 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:37| Our underage person went in and purchased a six-pack of Bud Light and it was no ID checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:47| You can step up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Hassan Sadeq, 9002 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Sir, what is your position with this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| I'm the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Do you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| I admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Mr. Sadeq, who is the seller of the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| An employee of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| What's their status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Our initial reaction was to terminate, but after reconsideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| she was going through tremendous difficulty with dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| She had no such issues before, had always been very vigilant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and we came to the decision that going through what she's going and facing the consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:40| that she would certainly be even increasingly more vigilant in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| So she is present with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| She is renewing her TIP certification as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| In fact, that was just this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| And so everything is fresh in terms of the information and how to go about the IDing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| How long has she been with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| She's been with us for nine months, eight or nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| What measures have you taken since this incident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| I generally wouldn't ask you questions, but no ID at all kind of startles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| That's my district, and I don't want a business selling alcohol to underage without checking ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| I don't want you to do it at all, but checking ID at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| I agree with you 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| And in fact, it was shocking to us because our registers are programmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| where you have to enter the birth date any time there's a beer sale to proceed with the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| We have reminders on both registers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| We have WEID signs all over the store, including at the point of sale, on the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| And as I said, if you want me to tell you what she was going through and why she did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| I don't think it makes sense because she made a mistake, and she's paying her consequences for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1791)|
| 0:30:00| And it's something that has never happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| How long have you had the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| It will be three years this November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| No other infractions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| That was actually going to be my question if you've had any other infractions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| But I guess your statement brings up a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| So your registers require the input date, so how does she get around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| We finally figured that out, and what we're doing is taking measures to try to avoid that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| It's a glitch in the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| It's like a software something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| So it was too technical for me to figure out, so we had actually some help come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| and assist us with that in making sure that you could not bypass that without entering the full date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| And if you enter the incorrect date of birth, it does reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Mr. Sadiq, I applaud you for the steps that you've taken and the fact that you've done so well with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:12| My question, I guess, would be for the law director in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| In this seller, she goes or he goes to court and is fined and puts on diversion, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:29| What is their status until the diversion period is over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Can they sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| They can work there but not sell beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Well, generally, it depends how the court writes the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| If the court writes the order and says that they can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| or they have to wait until the expiration of the diversionary program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| what the diversionary program normally serves, the purpose it serves is one, no criminal record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| and two, that if they comply with whatever requirements the court puts in there, at the end of that term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| it's as if a record never occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| So they could technically continue to work in that venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| That clears that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| I also wanted to just commend you on how well you've handled the situation, especially with your employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| I think that sets a good example for other business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| I appreciate that because she was very traumatized by the whole experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| She has two underage children of her own and she knows the consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| the peripheral consequences of making a sale like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| So we took that into consideration before cutting her off of her livelihood, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| She's there to make a living for her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| You know, in the 6th District, we've had a lot of problems with underage drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| particularly in the Powell community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| There was a time when about every year, you know, we had young people dying in car accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| So we're known, both Brad and I are known, for being extremely serious about these offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| And we usually ask for the maximum penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| But this gentleman today has, this is exactly the way a person should be when they come before us with an offense like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:26| So I would like to ask the law director, what is the minimum penalty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| I know the maximum is 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| What is the minimum penalty that we can give this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Because he is a model of an owner that is, you know, he's not arguing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| He's accepting responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| He's not firing a minimum wage employee over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| He's taken measures to retrain the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| And I think just an absolute model of how a business owner should act when they come before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| So what is the minimum penalty that we can give this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| No, the minimum penalty would be no penalty at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| You can just ask him merely to reduce to writing the steps he's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Your rules read that you may impose penalties, but you're not required to by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| And it would still go on record as a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| So if this happens again, it will come back to us as second offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| I mean, yeah, the fact that the offense occurred, exactly that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| But you need not take any punitive action today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Well, I would like to make the measure that just as a token that we give this gentleman a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| I'm sorry, but just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| In order to do that, you would have to suspend our rules because our rules are a minimum of $500 or a 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| I thought it was a maximum of $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Is it a maximum or a minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Well, your rules read as follows, that you may at your discretion exercise the following penalty scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| For sale of a minor, offer the violated choice of either a 30-day suspension or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| So you don't, the minimum amount you have listed in your rules is a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| However, you have the discretion as to whether or not you want to impose that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| So you need not impose a fine, but you can, for instance, go to a $125 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| It's either a $500 fine or a suspension or neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| What did he say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| The motion is that we just, you know, it will still count as an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| You've still been convicted of a first, if this passes, of a first offense, under age sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| but there will be no fine at this point because you've set such a good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| and you will need to send us a letter explaining the measures that you've taken to see that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:52| I will do that as business, and I thank you very much for looking at this in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| And, again, this is going to show the contrast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| This gentleman's done everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| In a minute, we're going to be talking about somebody who didn't do things quite so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| So that's my motion, and I appreciate the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| I would also like to comment on the fact that the gentleman has taken a second time to keep this employee intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:22| which helps the community in a way, and it doubly puts him in jeopardy to make sure that corrections are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:32| So I'm in agreement with this punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| We have a motion on the floor to not levy any fine, but it will be a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Deferred applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| 6A, the Anchor Group, Incorporated, 4-Way Pizza, 8310 Asheville Highway, on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| That's been withdrawn, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Yes, it's deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| 6A has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Discussion of letter requested by the Board of Commissioners from Quick Shop number 24, 7657 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| Marsco LLC owner regarding underage sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Discussion of letter requested by the Board of Commissioners from Quick Shop number 24, 7657 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| Marsco LLC owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| The commission has not received this letter, although the people that own the place said they sent it two months ago, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:55| I think this is an oddity, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, in that, if you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| prior to the court hearing on this matter, the attorney did appear and, at least on the record, stated the remedial measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| I think he prefaced it by saying, you have my client's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Then we went to court and the court then reduced the 120-day suspension to 95 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| I'm just concerned that it was the attorney who advised his client not to send anything subsequent since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| I don't have evidence before me that it's purposeful on the part of the business owner that the letter was never received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| and their claim that they sent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I have no evidence of that one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Is there a way for us just to ask him to resend the letter and give him 15 days or so to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| I can contact the attorney today and I can send him a letter demanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| Well, isn't their time up within the next couple of weeks anyway on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Well, their time is up based on the, it was overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| So it's kind of a moot point, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| They received time served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| So they actually, their license was suspended for 95 out of the 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Right, but it happened at like day 95, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Day 95 is the hearing and that was the date the court essentially said time served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| I'll send a letter to the attorney and nevertheless I think the commission has a right to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| what remedial steps are being taken despite the fact that they've been reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| Someone want to make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I'll make a motion we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Now that was 15 days, was that the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Commissioner Hayman, that was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| Mr. Law Director, I have a fax that came by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| Stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I have a fax that I got from them August the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| I'll forward it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| It's an e-mail from Marsco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| And I think it came to all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| They're from Greenville, Tennessee, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| I have a letter, a page and a half letter from Danny Blackburn, the vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| I'll e-mail it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| So we do have, we have the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| I remember reading it now and it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| It was sent, their attorney, Mr. Shope, has it cc'd to him and it came to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| Rear Board via the fax machine is how I got it on e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| So I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| We were in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I guess that brings up a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| We're asking that it be sent to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| I wonder if it might best be sent to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| This one, this fax number says Knox County Clerk, fax number 215-2038.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| And then I think it probably went to the commission fax and Mr. Joe Lee e-mailed it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:50| So if we have it then we don't need to send them a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| I have a letter and we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| We can re-send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| We can get the network back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| We can send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Would you all look at maybe on the beer applications or a letter, let it go to the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:15| because the commission office is on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| If they call up there, they've got to transfer them or even my number is not on here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| Just for beer applications or anything pertaining to beer, let it go to the Knox County Clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:37| I think that would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| I think they're better suited for keeping records and official records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Just as a clerical point of order for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| The form needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| Well, I'm talking about the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| When we ask them to write a letter stating what they're going to do to prevent it from happening again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| I think that should go to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| That way they can keep an official record of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| I think they need a copy of it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I think we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| We already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| And they've already complied, so we're really sort of at a moot point now, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| Discussion and possible action regarding the Board of Commissioners revoking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| or suspending any permit for the sale of beer when it is shown that the permittee is delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| in paying any fee or privileged tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| The payment which is required by the statute or ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| The Board of Commissioners may also revoke or suspend any permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| when the permittee fails or refuses timely information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2564)|

| 0:42:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Mr. Law Director, does this include property taxes too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:04| I asked that during intergovernmental and the answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| I'd like to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| I thought I'd taken care of this several years ago when we passed an ordinance up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| if they owed any kind of money to Knox County that we didn't do business with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| But, you know, we've got people that are out here that owe $17,000, $20,000 in back property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| and they're still conducting business at these establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| This is going to require, if I may, Mr. Chairman and members of the Board, an ordinance change, as you're aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| As to that aspect, I'll have to research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| I don't want to give you a definitive answer because there's been conflicting case laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| as to whether or not you can actually tie in something like a permit to overdue taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| But if it's certainly remotely legally defensible, we'll put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| If it's not, I'll inform the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| But nevertheless, you can proceed with that amendment and I'll just research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| If it's defensible, we'll certainly put it in there for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Does that include real or personal property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Any kind of money that they owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I thought we had covered this, Commissioner Luthor, a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| We said if they owed the county any kind of money, we couldn't do business with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| So it should be any privilege tax, property tax, any kind of money that they owe us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| The only distinction I'll make, sir, is that when we talk about doing business with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| the state does have a regulatory hand in beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| They defer to us somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| But it's not purely a county function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| And I'll make sure that's consummately researched and get you a definitive answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| It seems to me that that may confuse things because sometimes the owner of the property is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| from the owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| But the owner of the property, if he's leasing it, he should be up on his property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| But I'm not sure we can tie the permitting of the owner of the business to, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Commissioner Saunders, they would have, they would still have personal property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| which is a tax that is against non-real, that the assets that that business owns could be their cash register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| could be their displays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Sure, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| But the property tax itself may be a separate matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Well, you have, they're both property taxes, just that one's real and the other one's personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| We could possibly still attach the personal property tax to something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| There's also, we're going to have to, I think, devise some kind of tracking mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| I don't know what, how sophisticated the clerk's software is to be able to do that kind of search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| when a permit is entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| That's just a question we'll have to answer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| I don't want the Board of Commissioners to presume that we've enacted this and it's going to be as effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| Hopefully it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| But, again, Mr. Monning, are you capable of checking these things out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| I've checked them for the last 19 years, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| I thought you had because you showed me several of them where they owe quite a bit of money to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| I've checked personal property, real property, and was checking business tax, but I've quit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:26| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| I need to take a 15-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| Break is just adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:51| We're ready to start our August commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Clerk, would you have the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2817)|

| 0:47:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| You have 18 members present until he comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Eighteen commissioners are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Today, we're going to have devotional by Commissioner Ivan Harman with the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Yeah, I'd like to take this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| A lot of you, I'm sure, have seen the paper last Friday night, this young man passing away on the football field at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| I had the misfortune to be at that game, and there was probably a thousand people at this game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| But this young man was dedicated to his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| And his coach also said that, you know, if he had to go, this was the way he would like to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| But to see a young man pass away at 18 years old on the field, it was really a trauma to a lot of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| And I'd just like for us to remember his family and the football team and all the students that was at that game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| And also Saturday, I was invited to honor Jim Wagner, which his nickname was the voice of West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:42| He sang the national anthem at West High School at every football game and basketball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| And we honored him Saturday at Mount Olivet, or not Mount Olivet, but Olivet Baptist Church on Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| And I've invited Reverend Johnny Price to come and lead us in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| So if he'd come down, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:06| We are thankful for this privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| We counted an honor from Brother Ivan Harmon to come and pray for this assembly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| The only one that I can see that stands out in my mind today is Brother Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| He'd come to my house about 35 years ago and told me that I had to have insurance for my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| Well, I told him he didn't tell me anything, that I knew what I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| So I left it at that, but right now I want to apologize and say that I forgive you if you'll forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| Okay, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| We're glad to be here today, and we appreciate Ivan Harmon and for the standing he takes for our county, our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:57| and the standing he takes for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| If you don't mind, I'd like for everybody to join hands at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Heavenly Father, as we come before You, the throne of grace, to give You thanks and praise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| for all that You have done for us and for the blessings of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| We thank You, Heavenly Father, for our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| We pray Thy blessings upon them that whatever comes before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| that they would make the right decisions, Lord, to be carried out in a way that would be pleasing and that to You.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| We pray for all that's behind us today, Heavenly Father, that You'd bless every life that's represented here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| We pray, Father, Thy blessings upon each and every one and for our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| for our leaders, for our government, for our soldiers, men and women, and for Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| God, we thank You for this privilege, for this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and for the men that govern our county and our city and our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| We thank You, Heavenly Father, for all that You've done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| We ask all of this in the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Mr. Chairman, I have asked a true American hero to lead us in our pledge today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| Captain Mark Brogan is an alumni of UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| He was commissioned into the Army with the 172nd Striker Brigade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| He was deployed to Iraq in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| He was severely injured by a suicide bomber on April 11, 2006, while serving in the Anbar Province.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| He suffered severe traumatic brain injury and spent nearly a month in a coma and two years in rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| Because of his injuries, he is now retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| But I can tell you that he is not retired from activities because I met Captain Brogan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| through the self-help of Heart of Hearing, which my wife and I are a member of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3104)|

| 0:52:56| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| I'd like to move Resolution 906 up to the beginning of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| after we recognize the folks that we have on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3186)|

| 0:53:44| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| I'd like to move 802 and 804 to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| I would also like to remove from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| 804 has been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Move 804 and 802 to the front of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| and remove from consent 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| I think our honoree is here today and I'd like to move that up to the front of the agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I'd like for you to consider moving 908 up in the agenda, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| That's a pretrial release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| I don't know if I need to suspend the rules, but we want to talk about the form speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| and I'd like to probably need to vote on it since we're going to change when people can speak to public form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| Well, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| I'm going to go ahead and do what I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| I'm going to go ahead and do what I heard the Rules Committee want us to do today anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Can you explain to them what we're doing so everybody out there will know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| I might as well get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| The Rules Committee has decided that we will have three times to have public form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| One right after we honor the people, another right before zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| and the other at the end of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| And anyone speaking on an issue can speak at the time of the issue come before the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Oh, yes, always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Yes, I want to let you know that Resolution 101, the family is here, so whenever you can put that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| You want to take it off of the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| Yes, take it off of consent because they're here and we want to present that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| I would like to ask that we move up as far as we can on the agenda under other business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| item number six, the presentation regarding the flu vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| Already had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| So you want to remove it, move it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Move it up on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| We have a number of people here from the Health Department that need to get back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| In light, let's see, no, I want to use the word sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| If this meeting were to end before 8 o'clock, I would like to end the meeting with a discussion about sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:59| That's to add at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| If we're not out by 8 o'clock, I'll put it on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| It's related to about when citizens could speak at the forum, and this is another, I guess you'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| an expression of speech is that one of the constituents out here in the audience said that he had a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| that he was bringing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| And I was just wondering, what do our rules say about people bringing signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| And what is a sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I mean, we've seen people with big stickers on their lapels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Is that a sign, or is there a size, or what are our rules concerning signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| We've always allowed them to have signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| We've had times when things were very controversial that half the people in the audience had signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| I was going to say, I even wore a screw suit in here one time before I was on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| You know, I think we're looking at a civil rights lawsuit if we don't let folks express themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| I think this is a PBA issue, and I'm with Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| I think we need to send a letter to PBA, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| warning them that it is a civil rights violation if we don't allow people to express themselves in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| I think we should allow the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| We've always allowed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| But I do think there needs to be, it can't be disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| In other words, I remember one time we had a gentleman down here, and he was sitting in the front row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| and he kept holding up a sign and blocking the view of several rows behind him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| And I don't think that that should be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| I think everybody that's here has the right to be here and be unhindered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| And so as long as they're not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| hindering someone else's chance for free speech and being disruptive, I don't have a problem with the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| I think the signs are very much just like oral speech would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| is that, you know, we don't allow people to scream and yell and disrupt our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| That would be disruptive, and it's the same way with the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| If it's not disruptive, I think that's what you're trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Yeah, as long as they're not being disruptive and hindering other people that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| other citizens, then I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| If I could, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| in terms of Commissioner Briggs' question, your rules are, your written rules are silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| And you do have First Amendment issues, but you do have the ability to ensure that there can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| some constraints on hate speech or anything that would incite violence and things of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| But beyond that, your rules seem to imply at least that signage is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:46| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| I wanted to, are we through the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Is your agenda set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| No, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| I wanted to just speak about what I mentioned to you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Is that all right now or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Do you have something else, Commissioner Harmon, Ivan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| I need to add Resolution 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:15| Not also like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Hey, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| I would like to discuss when they, I know I'm not a commissioner down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| but I was wanting to discuss the Item 401 about the pipeline project in Solway when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| I think it's on consent right now, but I was wanting to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| I think I need a commissioner to take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| I'll ask that it be removed and just placed within the, back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:50| Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| I'd like to add one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| The superintendent wants to make a presentation to us, and he needs to get back to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| So he will be early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Let's go ahead and hear from the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Well, I want to go ahead and get the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Mr. Chairman, I have one correction I need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=3668)|

| 1:09:10| by the state statute, we need to have a public comment on 903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| which is KCDC taking over the Knox County Housing Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| Is there anyone that would like to make comments on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| One thing that I want to make sure of is I am all for KCDC taking over management of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| I think it's going to be an efficiency issue, but one thing I want to make very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| is that we're not bringing KCDC out into the county to do redevelopment districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| We have eminent domain authority through the Blighted Properties Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| for individual properties, and I think that that tool works just fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| the way we're using it now in the county, and I just want to make it very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| that this is about KCDC managing these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| and that they're not going to be out in Knox County declaring redevelopment districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| the way they do downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Is that pretty clear in the language of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Alvin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:35| Right now, Commissioner, that is pretty clear in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| If you could give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| My name is Alvin Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I'm the Executive Director and CEO for Knoxville Community Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| and I will give you the 901 Broadway address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| I'm there most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| The resolution that you have before you today is a resolution proving us to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| as a public housing authority and to manage and operate the public housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| that they currently hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| We would have to come back before this body and being directed by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| to actually perform a redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| So the resolution does not contemplate us doing redevelopment at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| I just wanted to make sure of that, and you guys do a great job of managing the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| It's just that my understanding is in the city, you'll declare redevelopment districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| where you cover everything within a certain area, and at this time in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| we single out specific properties rather than taking an entire area and declaring it blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| We only use eminent domain on single properties that are in extremely bad shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| rather than huge areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| And I just wanted to make sure that, for the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| that we're going to continue to do that the way we have been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| And I know that in the city there's been some redevelopment districts that have worked great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| that have been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Then there have been some that have been a bit more controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| and I just don't think at this time that we need that controversy in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| But, again, I think this is going to be you're going to make the management of these properties far more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| and look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I do want just for the record to be real clear, as Commissioner Lambert just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| KCDC is we do not actually go out and establish the redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| We are directed by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Then we go out and actually facilitate the project of setting up the redevelopment at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Yeah, while you're there, Alvin, I just want to mention a couple of things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Number one, you are a real shining beacon of good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| You do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| You and your staff do a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| My hat's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| I've followed your career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| You've done a good job since you've been in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Just tell the people just real quick how many units you have versus how many Knox County has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| and what your budget is versus what Bo's budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| Well, actually, the number of public housing units that the County Housing Authority holds at this time is 197 public housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| 562 Section 8 vouchers, and I do think that Bo's operating budget is around $2 million total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| KCDC administers 3,655 public housing units and we have close to 3,000 Section 8 vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| and our operating budget is about $35 million annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| Let me ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Alvin, give me those numbers again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| You have 3,500 apartments or residences you manage and about 3,000 are Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| Section 8 vouchers, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| So about 6 out of 7 are Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Well, no, those are separate programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| We've got 3,655 public housing units, which that means those units are owned by KCDC and they're managed by KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| So you have an additional 3,000 there are Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Section 8 vouchers that we administer on behalf of the City of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| So that's separate from public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| So almost half of your portfolio, if you will, is Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| A little more than half is non-Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| You administer 6,600?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| In other words, what you have to do is think about this in the sense of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| The 3,655 are actually housing units that people can move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| The Section 8 vouchers is only rental assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| and individuals go and choose to live in private property owned by someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Okay, they're not – can they be part of those 3,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| Cannot be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| They're two separate programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Like Summit or Morningside would not be Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Now Summit and Morningside can take Section 8 vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Again, it's property that people are living in that is not owned by KCDC when they use the Section 8 voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| You can't take a Section 8 voucher and live in public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| because you're already getting subsidy in public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| and all a voucher does is give you rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| That would be a double subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Briefly, the employment situation again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| about the assimilation of the people that work for the county today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| The people that work for the county today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| there's a total of 12 employees who work at the County Housing Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| We are going to absorb all 12 of those employees into KCDC's operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| because of the similarities in operating public housing in Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| Bringing those employees into our operations is actually going to be a lot easier transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| than if we were going out to hire new employees to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| There will be full employment at the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| There will be full employment at the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Alvin, I think it's also important to note that the employees that are with the county housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| are not on county insurance or any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| They have their own private insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| So it's not any of that or the retirement and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| They're completely separate from Knox County, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| That's a good comment, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| And also what Commissioner Shouse was referring to on the vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| that's for people that pay, was it 35 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Of the rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Just the gross income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| It goes toward their housing portion of their expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| I think Commissioner Carringer made a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| I think for both of our organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| neither one of us are receiving operating subsidies for public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| from either the county government or the city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| And neither one of us are parties to the city's retirement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| or the county's retirement plan or their health care plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| We are separate, stand-alone entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Alvin, is there a central location where someone needs to sign up for an apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| for subsidized housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Where do they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Well, right now, Commissioner Lutho,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| we've been operating with the idea that individuals will go to the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| where they wish to live and put an application in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| If a person wants to come to a central location to do an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| just for all public housing, they will come to the main office of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| We will continue to be maintaining an application office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| at the county housing site so that individuals will have that available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| to them in the county as well as in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| So if someone wants to sign up for subsidized housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| they could go to the county and under this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| they would be able to look at all of the 3,600 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| Of all public housing anywhere in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| If they only wanted to live at Virginia Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| then they could go to Virginia Walker and put an application in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| only for Virginia Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Property moved and seconded for the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4664)|

| 1:17:50| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Don Peterson, KCDC 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| I just want to bring to your attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| resolution 905 has an error in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| It makes it a recommendation as a amendment to the Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| It's really the Jackson Depot as noted in the intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| and finance agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| Make that note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Yes, go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Getting back to setting our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| we need to add all those items that were to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| If there was anything to be deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| to be deferred, anything to be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| And postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| This is in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| We'll move this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4713)|

| 1:18:39| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| My understanding was that the rural metro items were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| No one called for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| We'll be able to defer that as soon as we get to them if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| what they were moved up in the agenda and so that might be what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4741)|

| 1:22:05| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| I wanted to come before you this afternoon just to spend a few minutes with you talking about the strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:31| five-year strategic plan that was adopted by the school board on July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| And given the implications for our future in the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| and our future requests for funding, I'm sure, before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| I thought it would be useful for each of you to have a sense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| I did have the opportunity to send the full plan to each of the commissioners earlier this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| and I hope you got a chance to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| But what I'd like to do is just very briefly walk you through the structure of the strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| some of the goals associated with it, and what we're looking to do in terms of implementation and measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| And then I'd be glad, with your indulgence, Mr. Chair, to take any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| So you should have a handout before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| And the theme of the five-year strategic plan is excellence for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| And that's really what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| It's a very – excellence is a very high standard, and that's what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| And the fact that we're talking about all students, I think, is particularly important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| We're talking about students certainly who are achieving and students who are college-bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| but we're also talking about students who are struggling, students who are economically disadvantaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| We're really talking about achieving excellence for all of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| On page two of the handout that you have, we talk about the strategic goals that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| through this strategic planning process and the strategic plan that was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| The first is focusing on our students to ensure that they excel academically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| and that they're prepared for whatever comes next for them, for college, for career, for life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| to make sure that they have the skills and knowledge that they need to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| The second is ensuring effective educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| making sure that we have an outstanding teacher in every classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| and a great leader at the helm of every school as leadership is so important in public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Third, engaging parents in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| We understand that our parents are our key partners in the education of our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| that we can't do this work by ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| We need their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| We need their reinforcement of the lessons that our students learn during the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Infrastructure is the fourth area, and that's really about making sure we get done the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| that we need to take care of operationally and administratively to support education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| and the educational process rather than distract from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| And then finally, accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Accountability is really infused throughout the entire strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| and accountability for us is really about doing what we say we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| It's about making sure that everyone in our school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| all of the adults in our community are really focused on results for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| On page three of the presentation that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| we talked just a little bit about how this strategic plan came to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| I came before this commission a few months ago and talked a little bit about our vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| for the future of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| And this strategic plan is really about achieving that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| And we've had a very inclusive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| We've asked for community input throughout this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| I got the wonderful opportunity to visit all 86 of our schools, to talk to teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| to talk to parents, to talk to kids, and talk with our board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and others in our community and really get lots of input into this particular strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| Over a period of six months, we were very fortunate to have the input from members of the PTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| In fact, the PTA president for Knox County Council was on our strategic planning advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| We had a representative from the Chamber of Commerce, Jennifer Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| who was loaned to us part-time for about a six-month period to help facilitate the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| And the president of the Knox County Education Association was also a key player| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| in our strategic planning advisory group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| So we had great input and great representation in developing this strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| On page four, we talk about the first goal, which is focus on the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| And as I said, it's really about making sure that every student has the opportunity to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| We have five objectives within this particular goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| and you will see what those objectives are in the handout and up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| But I want to talk to you just very briefly about some of the highlights on page five of this particular goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| So the structure of this strategic plan is we have four main goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| We have multiple objectives that are outlined within those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| And then we have also timelines and metrics associated with each of those goals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| So we've really tried to make sure that we are very clear about what our objectives are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| and how we're going to achieve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| So a couple of the highlights under goal one, focusing on the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| Obviously, high standards and expectations are critical for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| We're moving to new, higher standards here in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| and we think that's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| And our curriculum and our instruction is really going to reinforce those high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| We're looking to expand inclusion for students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| to do more with students with disabilities in our regular education settings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| and so focusing a good deal on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| I won't go through all of them, but a couple of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| We are going to explore promotion standards at transition grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| and this is a little bit of a thorny issue because the research says that social promotion doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| But the research also says retaining kids in grade doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| So it's really a challenging issue for us, and over the next several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| we're going to take a close look at promotion standards at certain transition grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| where we know those transitions are very critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Individual learning plans and what we're calling success cards for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| really focusing on the individual kid, individual student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| laying out a pathway for them to be successful in their high school career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| what courses are they taking, in what sequence, at what level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| what services and supports do they need to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| and really having a plan for every single child to be successful at the high school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| and then eventually bringing that down into the middle school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| We know we need to do more in terms of alignment of our high-need schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| and one of the things that we've done is realigned our organizational structure a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| so that all of our elementary schools report to the same person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| all of our middle schools report to the same person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| all of our high schools report to the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| And we're really looking for alignment and coherence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| making sure that our expectations are universal and our communication is clear and consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:45| As we move on to goal two, effective educators, this is really about human capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| This is about making sure we have the best possible talent in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| in our central office, and at the leadership level of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| And a couple of highlights there on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| We're interested in establishing a highly selective leadership academy for our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| And I've said this to the commission before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| We've got terrific leadership in many of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| but the challenge is I don't think we've been as purposeful about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| or as deliberate about growing that leadership as we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| And so we want to develop a leadership academy to really focus on where that next generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| of leadership in our schools is going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Building stronger pipelines for talent into the teacher ranks and into the principal ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| And over time, I really do think we need to take a look at our compensation structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| Not only are we, when we look at compensation of teachers in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| we really are behind several of our nearest school districts, Oak Ridge and Maryville and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| But I think we have an opportunity to use compensation strategically as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| to look at compensation as a way to provide incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| and rewards for the types of behavior and performance that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| And so over time, I think that's an area where we really do want to take a closer look at strategic compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| And I think many of you have heard me talk about teacher collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| and professional learning communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| and making sure that our teachers are working together to learn from each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| to hone their craft, and really to get better at what they do continuously by working together as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| Parents and community, we know these are really perhaps our most important partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| We want to make sure that parents are engaged in the life of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| but more importantly, really engaged in the education of their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| And so a couple things on page nine that we want to take a look at in terms of some of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| I have now hired a person whose full-time job is to focus on family engagement in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:50| That's a new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| That's a new function within the school district, and we're just really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| Her name is Tracy Matthews, and she's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| And we're looking forward to a lot of the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| and the focus that that's going to bring to one of our most important functions in the school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| making sure our parents are partners with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Family-friendly schools, we know that we need to really practice what we preach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| And when parents come into our schools, that it's a welcoming, inviting environment for them to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| If we truly want them to be our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| we have to give them the access and the opportunity and the information they need to be partners with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| Infrastructure is really about, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| making sure we get right those administrative and operational things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| So things like our organizational structure, our finances, use of data to support decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| and informing decision-making and informing our instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| And then focusing our human resource function on that human capital perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| If we're going to achieve goal two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| we're really going to have to do something about the infrastructure in goal four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| On page 12 and 13, you'll see some of the performance targets that we have laid out for ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| in terms of how we're going to define our success over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| And those performance targets actually stretch out to the year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| And one of the reasons that we went out that far is because I know you've heard us talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| our overarching goal for our students, which is 100, 90, 90, 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| One hundred percent of our students completing high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| at least 90 percent of those graduating with a regular diploma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| at least 90 percent of those students taking the ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| and then at least 90 percent of those students scoring a 21 or better on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| We don't think that 21 is a magic number, but it's a very important number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| in terms of what students can demonstrate, what that demonstrates in terms of what students have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:43| and the skills that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| And it's also important in terms of the future opportunities that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| So we want to see the vast majority of our students scoring a 21 or better on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| And so we've put out our goals to 2020 because that's the time we adopted this 100, 90, 90, 90 goal two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5573)|
| 1:33:03| almost three years ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| So 2020 is the year that that first cohort of students that came into kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| when we were talking about this goal will graduate from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| And so that's where we've gone out that far, our time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| But most of our goals, if you look here, are listed through 2014 in great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| And it really is about making sure we get to that 100, 90, 90, 90 goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| If you look on the next page, page 13, you'll see a variety of other metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| And these are really leading indicators as to how we get to that 100, 90, 90 goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| These are really some benchmarks and road mile markers along the way to say this is how we get to that overarching goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| One of the most important ones, as you look there, is really about third grade reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| We want to make sure that every child is reading proficiently, reading on grade level by grade three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| And we want to keep them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| We want to keep them at grade level throughout their academic career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| We want to make sure they're reading at least at grade level throughout elementary school, middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| and into high school because that's how they access content in every other area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| If you're not a strong reader, you're going to struggle in every area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| You're going to struggle in mathematics and science because you're trying to read the text and you're struggling with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| So that's a really important indicator for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| And then on page 14, you'll see a couple of other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| And we did add one more in the final version of the strategic plan that you received for adequate yearly progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| making sure that we acknowledge the current accountability system that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| and have a goal in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| The timeline is a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| We're working on implementation at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| We're working with our principals and our teachers and our central office about how we make this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| This full document is about 103 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| We think it's a very good plan, but how do we make it real?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| How do we make it alive in our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| How do we move to implementation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| And we're working with our principals and our teachers to really make that happen in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| We talked about the metrics and the performance targets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| There are also some individual performance targets associated with each of the objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| We've got some more work to do there, but I think the overarching definition of our success will be under the performance metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| And then finally on page 17 is really about resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| What this page acknowledges is that we have $375-some-odd million, which is not a small sum of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| and that we need to make sure that we are using those dollars efficiently and effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| and putting the resources in place that are aligned with the work that we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| and really make the case to you as a commission and to the taxpayers that we are a good investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| and that we will use those dollars wisely and well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| Then I think when you look at this strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| and you look carefully at the strategies we are suggesting and the direction that we're going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| I think it does require a substantial increase in investment over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| And if we are serious about being successful in implementing this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| back of the envelope kind of a calculation is listed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| probably somewhere in the neighborhood of at least $13-15 million a year for the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| And that's not a small investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| And I don't say that lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| But if we're going to talk about strategic compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| if we're going to talk about talent pool that we need for our classrooms and leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| if we're going to talk about the type of investment that we need to make in high-quality instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| that's probably the level that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| And I think you know, as I came to you this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| we came to you with basically a level-funded budget because I believe we had a lot more work to do to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| we can make some reductions here, we can make some reallocations there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| and we can really be more efficient and effective with the dollars that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| But I believe if we are truly going to achieve excellence for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| we do need to think about the level of investment of resources that we have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| So I will leave it at that, and I'll be glad to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| When Chairman Strickland asked me what I wanted when I came here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| I told him nothing really except to talk with you about the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| In fact, I failed to mention the part about the resources at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| But I'm glad to take any questions that you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| and look forward to working with you over time to see if this is an investment that we are able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| to ensure excellence for all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Dr. McIntyre, I really appreciate your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| You've worked real hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| I don't see where you've addressed the saggy bridges, though, yet, so time will take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| What I really did want to comment on is the district that I represent is the Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| of course, Central High School, and the changes that you have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| I'm alumni president for Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| and at times that I've gone since you have made the changes, just in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| just one example, last week I was in there one of the times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| and they come out with outstretched hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| They come, they greet you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| Just the enthusiasm of the staff is quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| and the changes that you've made, the fiscal changes, the paint jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| the things that you've done, just trying to bring up morale and spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Went to the pepper that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| They did a real good job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| So the new administration seems to be being well received out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| The community is really watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| The community is behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| You have a lot of Central High School alumni, and we want that school to be the leader in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| So we're all pulling for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| If there's anything that we can do, you let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| I certainly appreciate that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:37| And there is a great energy and excitement about Central High School right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| and you've got a great administrative team in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| and I think really about rebuilding the culture based on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| and I enjoyed going there because their motto is pride in tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| And when I went last time, there was a big banner up, and it said not only pride in tradition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| but it said pride, tradition, and excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| And I thought that was a great addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| and I think you're going to see that at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| We appreciate all the changes that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| Where do we stand right now in terms of per capita student expenditures in relation to other counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:21| We have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| In fact, that has been requested by the commission, and so we're working on providing that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:31| I don't think we're far off from a lot of other counties close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| but we do see particularly counties that have some substantial resources like Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| and like Maryville have invested that largely in higher salaries for their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| Are we above or below the state average right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| I believe we're slightly above, but we'll get that information to you for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| And the other point is just copy editing on page two of your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| the five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Focus on the student to ensure they excel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| That would be subject-verb disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| and I'm sure we don't want in a presentation on excellence subject-verb disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| I'm sure you will correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| I can't believe Mr. Norman didn't have his red pen out for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Thank you, Chairman, and I thank you, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| for the excellent leadership you've displayed and projected since you've been in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:31| I want to ask you to just give us a thumbnail sketch of the duties of that new staff position you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| the family engagement manager or person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| Is that single families or single family children or no family kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| No, it's for all families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| It's really a position that's about family engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| And so it's about how do we proactively support all of our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| in being an integral part of the education of their kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| And at the outset, it's really about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| One, being a resource and a support for our schools as to how they better engage families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| in the education of kids at the school level, how they make sure that they have a family-friendly atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| And then the other part of it really is this is a person who will sit on my leadership team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| and will ensure that as we have discussions about resources, about instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| about the future of the Knox County schools, that parents and families are an important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| of that conversation and that dialogue that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| Have you seen this officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| Did you have one in Boston or have you seen that work in other jurisdictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| I have seen it in Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| The position was actually a deputy superintendent at one point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| But there's different models and different ways and different folks have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| But I think for me it's just a recognition that that's an important component of the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| And unless there's someone who wakes up every day we all have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| It's all of our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| It's a part of everyone in the system and all of us have to focus on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| But unless there's one person who wakes up every day thinking about how we do this better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| it's difficult to make real traction on it and real gains on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| And so this is a person who's going to make sure that the needs of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| and the educational process continues to be on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| I look forward to seeing how that develops and thank you for your leadership there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Dr. McIntyre, I do appreciate your goals and enthusiasm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| and I think these are reachable goals and I don't think that we're going to fix it overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| I think it's going to take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| I guess my question is when we talked about the substantial investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| and I understand schools are going to cost more every year just as most everything else does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| what kind of measuring stick are we going to use to justify a 13 to 15 million dollar increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| over the next five to six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| It's hard for me and, you know, I think what we concentrate on as a school system very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| is the top 10 percent and the bottom 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| And that 80 percent there in the middle kind of gets left out most of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| in most school districts I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| But what kind of measuring sticks are we going to use to justify that kind of increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| and how are you going to show us as a commission that things are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| and that extra funding is needed next year in the budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| Well, I think, you know, the measures that we put up on the board here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| this is a very public declamation of our goal set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| and what we think are the measures of our success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| And so I think we've outlined in some detail what we want to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| and what level of success that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| I think high school graduation rate is going to be a real key one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| And, of course, as we have said, the proportion of our students that graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| take the ACT and score a 21 or better on the ACT really will define our success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| And so that's our push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| And we've put in place a variety of metrics here that we think are really will speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| whether that investment has paid off or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| And, you know, I hesitate to even put a number down on paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| because at this point all of it's really sort of back of the envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| until we really talk more about implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| But when you think about the types of interventions that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| when you think about the quality of instruction that we need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| and continue to grow and get better at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| but the quality of instruction that we need to have to make sure that every child is going to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| We do have lots of interventions that I think are helping our students who are really struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| And I think it is that middle group that we really have to push the issue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| And we've done a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| But quality instruction is the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| AVID is a program that we've put in place in some of our middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| and it's bubbling up to our high schools that is really focused on that middle tier of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| And it's focused on making sure that they have the skills and the structure to be successful academically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| that they know how to study, that they know how to organize themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| And it's shown great results elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| So I think, you know, there's lots of individual metrics of some of these individual strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| But the way we're going to see if we're successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| the way that we're going to define our success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| and hold ourselves accountable are the measures that I put up on the board for our student academic success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| for our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| Mr. McIntyre, it's almost September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| And so I am sure that if you haven't already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| you're going to be looking at the budget next year, probably within the next 60 days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| So as you look at next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| I would encourage you to involve the commission as much as possible as we go through these funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| We are your funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| And historically, we have not been involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| We have received a document in May or June that says, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| So I would just suggest that as you go through the process, these are great goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| Let us be a partner with you in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| and include us as much as you feel comfortable in that process as we go forward over these next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Did you have something else for Commissioner Schaff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Chairman, may I just say one more word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| And that is just I want to follow up, and I'll put this in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| but I just wanted to follow up with the appropriation that the commission made at the request of the school board last fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:34| in terms of safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| And I just want to reassure the board that we have used those dollars wisely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| and well to enhance safety and security in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| I will give you a written document that shows you our expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| and we spent almost all of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| We've got a little bit of money left over in the area of student information incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| And one of the things that we're going to be doing this fall is piloting an anonymous tip text line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6413)|
| 1:47:01| in two of our high schools and to see if that's a structure that will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| and provide us with information that's actionable from students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| We want our students to be part of the solution in terms of student safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| But in terms of the appropriation that was given, we hired the additional school resource officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| We invested in some video technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| We began a process of random searches this past spring that will continue in the fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| and did some great professional development, including a school resource officer school, an SRO school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:35| that was done in conjunction with the sheriff's office, Knoxville Police Department, and the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| So we were delighted to have that appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| We think we've used it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| And I'll report back to the commission in writing on the specifics of those expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6471)|

| 1:54:05| and that was when Dad finally convinced Mother that by serving on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| that it would only be two hours a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=6851)|

| 1:56:40| to the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Board as a representative for ambulance service operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| And whereas the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Board oversees the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7005)|
| 1:56:52| and is responsible for establishing all rules governing statewide emergency systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| which is comprised of thousands of paramedics from 210 ambulance service companies operating over 1,300 ambulances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:05| and transporting over a million patients annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| And whereas the rules and protocols established by the prestigious board help ensure that the same high standard of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| is available in Tennessee's rural counties as well as its metro areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| And whereas with over 30 years of experience in emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| Rob Webb has served as president of the Tennessee Ambulance Service Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| the East Tennessee EMS Directors Association, and received the 2005 American Red Cross Hero Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:41| And whereas Rob Webb also serves as deacon and youth leader at Central Point Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:47| where he is involved in many community services projects, including an annual medical mission trip to Honduras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:55| And whereas Mr. Webb considers his job a lifetime commitment to improving the lives of those around him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| and although he is highly qualified and extremely successful in his role as a division manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| he is truly an EMT at heart with a sense of compassion that sets him apart from all other administrators in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:16| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| The commission of Knox County hereby honors Rob Webb for his appointment to the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7101)|
| 1:58:29| He is a true asset to our community in both the emergency medical service field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| and as a community volunteer contributing to the growth and enrichment of all the lives he touches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:40| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Rob Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| A personal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Rural Metro is a dear friend of the Armstrong family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| They came to my aid on more than one occasion with my wife and my father-in-law and my mother-in-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| It seems like they're always there when I can't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| And I know that they serve the rest of the community the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| and all of their EMTs and the ambulance people themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| And it's such an honor and privilege to stand here with Rob today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| because he is the epitome of the people that actually come and serve us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| And I just feel honored to be able to congratulate him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you very much, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| Rob, my only point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| I just want to emphasize he manages 715 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| That's a pretty big workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| So when we talk about economic growth and workforce in our region, Rob's got a very diverse workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| and, you know, there's only 13 people on this board statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| So it's important that we have someone right here from the home team representing us on this board in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| So the mayor's proclamation says about the same thing as the county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| So I'll just pass it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| Rob, thanks, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| I just want to say thank you very much for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| On behalf of our 700 employees, each of them do a remarkable job in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7219)|
| 2:00:25| And it's a pleasure to lead them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| And I will do my best to serve Knox County on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:43| We're taking 906 on page 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| This is a resolution requesting the Knox County government ensure that employees who are also nursing mothers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| who wish to continue breastfeeding after returning to work are provided at county expense a clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| convenient, comfortable and private location to express milk at the work site as well as be provided with adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:05| break time in which to do so, free of harassment, as well as permitting a nursing mother to breastfeed her child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| in any location, public or private, as authorized by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| as well as support HR 2819S1244, the Breastfeeding Promotion Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| currently pending in the United States Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| No, no recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| 802 approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| We have something from Commissioner Broad before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| Is there anyone here who wanted to speak on behalf of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| I know we have some breastfeeding moms who came today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| I'm Sherry Hedberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| I am a registered nurse and international board certified lactation consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| I am the co-chair of the East Tennessee Breastfeeding Coalition that is based here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| and also the administrator of the Breastfeeding Center at Lisa Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| Do you need an address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| 1925 Ayler Avenue, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| I just wanted to say a few things and answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:22| The true mother of this resolution, Marcy Singleton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:29| a very highly regarded employee of the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| who is the breastfeeding coordinator for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| passed away on August 10th suddenly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| And so we are here today in support of something that she wanted to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| But from a professional standpoint, I may not be quite up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| in the supportive arguments for this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| but I will do my best as a lactation consultant to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| Commissioner Hamlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| I don't know if you're the proper person to answer this or if Ms. Fogerson is the proper person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| But the resolution asks that we ensure that employees who are nursing mothers continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| to have a clean, comfortable, private location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| Do they not have that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| And if not, what specifically can we do to make sure that we're complying with the needs of these mothers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:34| I think everyone here is in favor of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| but I guess we're looking for some specifics as to what do we need to do in terms of what you would like to see us do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| to make sure we're complying with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| Well, it really depends on whether those employees have a private office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| and I'm assuming that most employees do not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| The challenge with breastfeeding mothers is finding a private, clean space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| It doesn't have to be a large space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| Clayton Family Home, they have these types of nursing rooms for their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| and we use them as an example often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| Very small room, comfortable chair, electricity because most pumps do require access to an outlet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:19| and also a refrigerator so that moms can properly store their milk for the day while they're there at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:27| And that's really it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| So it doesn't require a large space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| We've even adapted some closets into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| Just really any space that's better than a public restroom, which a lot of moms are being forced to use today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:42| because I don't think any of us would like our breakfast, lunch, or dinner to be prepared in a restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| So that's really what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| So, Ms. Fogerson, is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Could you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Are we providing what is necessary for these county employees to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| In the city county building, we do have a very small room that is equipped with one chair, one small table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| and it has the electric outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| Could we use a larger room, a nicer room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| But we have had, since this law was implemented, a locked room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| We have one room to take care of six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| We have in our handbook a notation that if you are interested in using the room to please contact us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| and it has seldom been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| I have spoken to a few nursing mothers who have told me that they, by and large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| have used either their own individual private offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| or found a private room within their own office suite to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:51| If I can add, Donna Young from the City Parks and Rec Department, Greenways Coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| has offered us a larger space in her department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| If you haven't checked out the breastfeeding or the pumping room upstairs, it is pretty dismal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| A lot of our employees who have found other places to pump have done so because that room is so dismal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| It is basically a storage closet with a very uncomfortable chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| It is not a room that I would want to use, and it doesn't provide any refrigeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:25| So it does meet the bare minimum requirements, I think, that our employees deserve better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:35| Also, there is a hole in the door that is covered with a piece of paper right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| But we are being offered, through Donna Young, a better space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| We just need to get a more comfortable chair and a small refrigerator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| It is not going to take much to make this room what it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| Would it be possible for you, Ms. Fogerson, to meet with Dale Smith of PVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| check out these facilities and report back to us on what we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| Because I agree, from what I am hearing, we need another space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| And if this is being offered, if you could check into that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| If this is an appropriate time, I have a couple of points of clarification from this resolution that I'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| The caption says that this resolution concerns providing a private location to express breast milk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:24| but yet the full resolution says, or breast feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| So I was wondering if it was your intention that our nursing mothers be permitted to bring their infants to the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:39| I don't know why that's, I don't think it should make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| I mean, if someone happens to have their baby at work for some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| and wants to take it there to nurse it, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| I wouldn't have a problem with the occasional visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| but I was wondering if it was the intention of your resolution to state that nursing mothers may bring their babies to work daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7673)|
| 2:08:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| That's a bit of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| I have one other point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| It states that this room should have a refrigerator, chair of appropriate size and comfort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| locking system and any other necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| Is that left to the nursing mother to decide if she wants a radio or cable TV or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:26| She certainly needs a radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| Who went to WIVK and ripped the knob off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| There might be a conflict of interest with that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| I think it would be nice to have a room that has a sink, but I don't think that's possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| so having a big bottle of hand sanitizer there would probably be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| But, no, we're not outfitting this as a place to go hang out during your break time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| You're there for a specific reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| We just want it to be, as you may know, getting your milk to let down and express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| It's difficult to do unless you're pretty comfortable and relaxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| So if you're in a situation that's going to make you uncomfortable, make that difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| That's what I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| That was my primary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Certainly we can outfit a room in this building like this, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| I guess maybe a third question is whether or not we were talking about all work locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| or whether we were referring to primarily just the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| The room that I'm talking about we want here in the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| but I think that our satellite areas like any place where we have county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| the supervisors of those departments need to know that they are required by law to provide a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7780)|
| 2:09:47| to any of their employees who request one, that it's not okay for them to pump in the bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| State law would already provide for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| that we have to have a room other than a toilet stall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7796)|
| 2:10:04| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| That was the question I was getting ready to lead into is we have libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| we have other health departments, we have satellite offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| and I want to make sure that this is going to apply to all of those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:25| The state law applies to all facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| To everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| This specific resolution applies to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| It doesn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| But we can certainly amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| That was my question also, that this resolution doesn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| This could be construed as any county office in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:46| Well, I believe that we need to, if our employee wishes to pump at one of our satellite locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:57| they need to be provided this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| I don't know that some of our locations would have something that could be, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| dedicated, but at least needs to be, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| and most of them probably have a room that could be set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| They're not going to have the number of employees they need as often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| The smaller satellite offices and, like, engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| and the library and the schools, they have a much smaller number of employees on site than the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:34| It's not likely that they're ever going to need a room like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| But if they do, there are state minimum requirements that have to be met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| and they have to meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| And another part of my question is, is that we do share this building with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| and would we be sharing this room with city employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Commissioner Briggs hit on a good point here the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| How long does this go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| And is this to be done on their break time, or are we to give them more break time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:09| Frances, you had the answers about break time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| State law says reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| State law says unpaid break time and says reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| Doesn't define that, but what I mentioned in committee meeting the other day is that the Fair Labor Standards Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| says that any break that does not exceed 20 minutes is compensable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| So as long as the break does not exceed 20 minutes, it is a paid break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| And the state law also says that this applies to nursing mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| So whatever age the child is, as long as she is still nursing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| this provision that she be given break time at work would still apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7971)|
| 2:12:58| How many break times would we have to give them a day, Frances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| It says reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| And it also says that you shall not be required to provide break time under this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| if to do so would unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| Again, words that are not specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| I do not know what would be unduly, an unduly disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:25| I think it would vary from work setting to work setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| And it's also going to vary from mom to mom and depending also on the age of the child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| that she's expressing milk for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| Someone who's just returned from maternity leave and has a much smaller infant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| and all they're taking is breast milk is going to need to pump more frequently than a mother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| whose child is 18 months old and they only need to go pump once a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| So it really is going to vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| But I don't think, you know, going to pump your breast is not something that's a whole lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8034)|
| 2:14:02| I don't expect that women will be abusing this to get extra break time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| And I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| I could speak on working a lot with mothers who are working in breastfeeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| and I can say that the majority of pumping times are under 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| Most mothers typically pump once in the morning, once at lunch, once in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| and then go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| And that would be for a younger baby, six weeks to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| And then usually after that it's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| But that would generally be what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| I would point out that the law also says that these breaks may run concurrently with other breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| So it doesn't have to be in addition to your lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| and whatever breaks your department may give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| You can require that they use their lunch period and their regular break period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| if such is designated, their department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| One thing that I don't like is unfunded mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| When the federal government sends something down to us and they don't fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| I don't particularly care for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| If we're going to ask PBA to fix this room up, I really think that we need to commit some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8120)|
| 2:15:26| We need to go ahead and state in the resolution a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| and we need to commit some funds to this because if they're going to need to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| if they're going to have to buy a new chair and repaint a room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| they're going to need some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| Amy, have you got any idea how much this is going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| Well, a gallon of paint is what, about $20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| A little mini fridge I think is around $70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| A glider rocker is a couple hundred maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| Less than $500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| Yeah, less than $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| Less than $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:00| We could, and I'm willing to commit, if this commission would donate $50 each of our discretionary money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:09| that would get them considerably more than they would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| And I'm willing to do that if everyone else is in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| I just think if we're going to ask PBA to do this, we need to give them a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:20| so that they have some money available to do this with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| Can I offer that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8188)|
| 2:16:29| If the rest of the commissioners agree, you're talking about their money, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| Does anybody have a problem with $50 a piece of discretionary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| I don't have a problem with $50, but I would rather Ms. Fogerson go to PBA, let them come back to us next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| and say this is what it's going to cost, this is what we're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| Because right now we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| And I think once we get the cost, then we can determine how we're going to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| But right now we just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| I withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Well, we also need to determine what building or buildings we're talking about here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8213)|
| 2:17:01| I think we already did, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Didn't we say it was only going to apply to the city county building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| Are you amending your resolution to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| I thought we'd already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| You talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| We didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| This specifically applies to the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| However, I do want everyone to be aware that in our other offices that if a nursing mother requests a room like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8241)|
| 2:17:29| she is entitled by federal law to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| That it is not okay to send your employee to the bathroom to express breast milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8253)|
| 2:17:39| And you're making that as part of your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| I have an insurance question for Amy and for Frances, whoever can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| You talk about refrigerators, and that's a good point that we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| What concerns me is the safety of that being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| Have you thought about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| I mean, when they put that in there, isn't that a fall-on responsibility of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| If something happened to that baby and the baby got sick, somebody went in and tampered some milk, that scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| Or these refrigerators are so inexpensive, like you say, $70 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| Could these women leave a refrigerator at their offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| I hate that we leave this here, and then she comes back and gets something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| Nobody is supposed to have access to that room except the nursing mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| No one can go in that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| We would control the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| I mean, you pick up the key from our office, sign it out, we would know who would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| Several nursing mothers that I spoke to said they would have particular concern with using a refrigerator that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:40| unsecured and, in fact, said that their kits for expressing breast milk had provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:47| gel packs and that type of thing, and it would be their personal preference to keep it with them at their desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:54| But I really don't know what all the kits, backpacks contain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8334)|
| 2:19:01| So you're saying she can take it back to her office and she can keep it cool with this kit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| The very few employees that I talked to said yes, they would have a kit that had, it's an insulated bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:13| It's a cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| It's a little cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| It's like a little cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| It's something for you all to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| Whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| But I just want to look at the liability of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| Does the federal law, though, does not require a refrigerator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| It's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| It's a state law and it does not require a refrigerator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| It doesn't address the furniture in the room, furniture fixtures or equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:36| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| I'm just wondering, we have several employees who are over here in the old courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| and all areas off of the city county property here that are Division Street and everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:51| How do we just address this in the city county building without providing the same facilities everywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8391)|
| 2:20:01| It's already, state law says that every employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| But how can we spend money here to do it in the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| and not spend the money in all the other county places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| And what I'm saying, I mean, if we do this, which I'm not opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| I'm just saying how do we do this one and not do it at every area where there's county workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:25| Because the bulk of the workers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Yes, I think that's the biggest distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| But it's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| We've got to provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| If it's requested at the satellite offices, it has to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| But if you've only got a dozen workers there and none of them are of childbearing age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| you're not going to go create a breastfeeding room there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| There are thousands of employees here, many of whom are pregnant or will be pregnant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| and need a place to express milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| I know there's a lot down in Juvenile Division Street and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| I mean, you've got young employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| We've got them over here in the old courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| I'm just saying if we provide it one and we're asked to provide the same thing over in the old courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| then we've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Amy, could you add the words for the satellites as needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| That way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| And required by existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Well, I think we already had the as required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| I just think with the word as needed because some locations may need one for a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| and then other locations won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| Well, I think if you put just the city county building that we're locking ourselves in to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8491)|
| 2:21:37| Then let's just remove that amendment and not just specify just city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| And just say in Knox County facilities as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| And Knox County facilities as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| Does the second agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| Who seconded our motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| Yes, I'll agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| If we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8518)|
| 2:21:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| We're going to page 20 of the vaccination discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:13| They know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Page 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:29| Presentation regarding flu vaccination finance and intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| Send it to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| Just send it to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| Be at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8560)|
| 2:22:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| Commissioner Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| I'm with the Knox County Health Department 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| Just something to say about one of our employees that was mentioned a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| Marcy Singleton, who died two weeks ago at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| And I think we're going to have a resolution next on the agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| She really was a recognized expert in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| I think I had been a director over there maybe a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| And she came to my office and she said, we've got to do something about this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| We've got to have a better place for mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| And we got a committee together and we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| Marcy was a great employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| And, again, you'll hear about her next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| About the flu season here in Knox County, I'll give you a brief summary of what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:35| and what our planning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| And then maybe you'll have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| We've got three flu projects, flu vaccine projects, as you know, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:46| We have our seasonal flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| And then we have our FluMist project in partnership with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| We're in our fifth year of doing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| And it's a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| And then we have plans for the novel H1N1 vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| And so I'll tell you just a little bit about what we're doing in each of these campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8642)|
| 2:24:09| The seasonal flu vaccine, the expectation this year is that there's not going to be a shortage of vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:17| In fact, Knox County's adult vaccine has already arrived and we've already started giving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:24| The vaccine for children, the VFC, we're expecting it to arrive this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:31| We started giving out the vaccine last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| We have a grant that pays for the first responders' flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:42| So we distributed that to the first responders, which included the law enforcement, EMS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| and fire personnel last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| So they've already had their shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| We started offering it to the public last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| The health care workers, our employees, will be receiving the seasonal flu vaccine this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:04| One more note, I know there's been questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| I understand there were some questions today when we were giving the vaccine here this afternoon about the early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:14| about giving it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| The recommendations is to give it as early as possible as when you receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| And Dr. Briggs may want to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| But, again, the CDC has recommended giving it as soon as you acquire it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| And that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| The FluMist project will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| And, again, that's a project where we have we offer a FluMist to all school-aged children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:47| That's private, public, and also in some daycare centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| We'll start doing that on September the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| And it will run to October the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| We're offering that to all elementary and middle school students at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8758)|
| 2:26:05| We'll also provide it to daycare centers where there's at least 100 kids enrolled where we'll go to the daycare centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| and actually do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| As you know, this is not this is a private grant that buys this vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:21| The only local, the only funding for this is our staff's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| It's a great project, and we have a wonderful partnership with the schools in providing this vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| Again, fifth year we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| The big question, I think, the questions that certainly the questions the media have is about the H1N1 vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:43| and what we know is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| And there's a problem there because it seems to change every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| The availability, the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| But I'll tell you what I know and what was current this morning and what was sent out on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| We know that the whole country will have 195 doses have been ordered by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| So the expectation is there will be plenty of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| and everyone that wants the vaccine should be able to receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| As far as the shipping time and when we'll start doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| those are the dates that continue to kind of move around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| As of Friday, the expectation is that we would be receiving vaccine in mid-October to the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:31| Across the country, there's expected 45 million doses to be available by mid-October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| with 20 million doses added each week thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| So about 65 million doses by the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| Tennessee can expect to receive about 2% of that or about 1.3 million doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:54| At that point, the CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health will control how the vaccine is distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8874)|
| 2:28:01| The first doses that will come here will probably be allocated, this is what we expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:07| to health care workers and to first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8887)|
| 2:28:11| Then as the supplies increase, the vaccine will be available through many outlets at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8891)|
| 2:28:18| Distribution, we will start giving the vaccine as soon as we receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8898)|
| 2:28:24| Priority groups, and these are the priority groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| and particularly the people who really need to get vaccinated for the H1N1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8908)|
| 2:28:34| There are five pregnant women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| These are not in a particular order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| People who care for or live with infants who are less than six months of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:47| Medical personnel, which includes first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| People between the ages of six months and 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| And then people between the ages of 25 and 64 who have chronic medical conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8935)|
| 2:29:04| Our planning, if we do mass clinics, some of you know that we probably have more experience at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8944)|
| 2:29:12| than other health departments because of the way we do the flu medicine in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8952)|
| 2:29:19| We have several models that we continue to look at to make sure that we have a method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:28| of providing this vaccine quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| Here's three of the things we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| Saturday clinics where we would actually use a public school in each of the sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:43| That plan is a plan we've had for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| We've had practice exercises on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| We feel like that's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| We've discussed with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| We think that's something we will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| Other public sites, we've talked about the Expo Center and the malls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=8996)|
| 2:30:01| The Coliseum, we've also, this is just, we don't have this in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| but we've also talked about maybe joining with other regional health departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| and if we need to do a mass clinic in the fall or in the end of October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| we might even look at doing something at a UT football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| We also may participate with a free flu shot Saturday if we have the vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| which I don't think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| Staffing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| We, of course, would have our Knox County Health Department staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| We have a contractor for FluMist Medical Solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| You all approved the contract last month on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:45| but I have met with their administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| and we have a verbal agreement at this time that they would also help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| if we needed help in administering the H1N1 vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| We also have a good list of volunteers that we're counting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| several schools of nursing, Medical Reserve Corps, the Red Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| We have an agreement with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| Several public service organizations such as the Rotary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| and some other coalitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| Funding for this, we know we're going to receive $237,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:24| This is federal money that's been passed down to Knox County through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| That may be on the agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| That will be for supplies and personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| That's Phase 1 funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| We expect Phase 2 funding, and I don't have an amount on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| but that would actually be for the vaccination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| And that's the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| And we suspect that that's going to be enough money to do what we need to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9106)|
| 2:31:53| Other information, communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| we have weekly conference calls with the Tennessee Department of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| with the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| and I'm very active in the National Association of City-County Health Officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| who are very active in sending out information on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| A great website is flu.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| If you have information and you want to look it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| that website is usually very current in what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| The CDC website is also, which is part of that, is also good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| And that's all I have, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| Yes, I just want to use this opportunity to encourage the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| and I'll speak first to the ordinary flu vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| is that this is something that everyone needs to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| And I'd like to make it clear that some of the older vaccines that were given were attenuated vaccines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| which meant they gave you a mild case of the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| And you'll hear many people say that they got sick when they got the flu shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| or it gave them the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| And the old vaccines that we had a number of years ago did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| And for that reason, some people are reluctant today to get the newer vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| The ones that we have today are what they call recombinant vaccines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9180)|
| 2:33:04| and it will not give you the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| If you get sick when you have the shot, it's not because of the shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| Your arm may be sore, but it will not give you the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| And it's something that you, and particularly for children, need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| They've done studies in Japan that found out if they had mandatory vaccination of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| they could just eliminate the flu because that seemed to be the vector of transmission even to older people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| The second thing is that we're still learning about the H1N1 virus, the so-called swine flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9208)|
| 2:33:35| And some of us are old enough to remember in 1976 when we had a swine flu outbreak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:41| that turned out not to be so severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| There were people who there was the vaccination was generally available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| and there were some problems with the vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| It's a different manufacturing process now, and that vaccine is undergoing testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| And I think by the time that they have it available for the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| we'll know if there's any problems to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| And so we'll be able to make recommendations to the general public as to what the risks are from the vaccine itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9242)|
| 2:34:09| Those really are the two points I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| And like I said, the flu vaccine, the ordinary flu vaccine is something that everyone should take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9252)|
| 2:34:19| I'd strongly encourage everyone when it's available to take it to the Knoxville Academy of Medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| where the people here in Knoxville that originally had the program, the flu shot Saturdays where we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| It's done by the health department and other organizations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| And then secondly, I think we'll have plenty of information about the H1N1 virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9272)|
| 2:34:37| by the time that vaccine becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| And also to the best of my memory, this is the earliest that we've had a flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| I don't recall it ever being available this early, so I think it's good that we got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9282)|
| 2:34:46| because in the past sometimes there's been questions of availability of the ordinary flu vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9286)|
| 2:34:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| A couple of quick questions, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9296)|
| 2:34:57| So the vaccine that's being administered now is not for swine flu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| It's for regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| It's for the seasonal flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| And this will come in October, you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| The latest projection is mid-October, the first shipments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9308)|
| 2:35:13| So our belief is that maybe we would be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| We're going to do it as soon as we're going to be ready to give it out as soon as we get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:22| but maybe by the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| Now, with the amount of dosage that we'll get, what percentage of our people do you think will be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:29| vaccinations for the swine flu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:33| You know, I think if the state, and it's going to come from the CDC to the state health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| and then sent out through the regional health departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part1?start=9339)|
