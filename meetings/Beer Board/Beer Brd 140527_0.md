| 0:15:18| second. All in favor? Aye. All right, thank you. Would you tell us a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| the Whammy Music Bar? Yes, it's a music venue and cafe, coffeehouse. Obviously with beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| Yes. Okay, all right, thank you. All right, we are waiting to hear from the Big Brothers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| and Big Sisters of East Tennessee. I believe Matt McMillan is the person. All right, name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=937)|
| 0:15:46| and address, please. Matt McMillan, 116 Adair Drive. All right, and Sergeant Hunter? No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| applicable record. Ms. Dyer? The file is complete. All right, do I have a motion? So moved. Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| Second. All right, now, all those in favor? Aye. All right, tell us about your event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Basically, we're kicking off Knoxville Craft Beer Week, which precedes the Beer Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| on the 21st. So the kickoff is the 14th. It's during the Farmer's Market. We'll be sampling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| all Tennessee brewed beers with all the beer being donated and proceeds going to Big Brothers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| and Big Sisters. Okay, so we'll have a week to practice before brew fest. Oh, yeah. We'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| make you an expert by Saturday. Okay, all right, well, that's good to know. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| thank you. We have some other items on the agenda that we need to address. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| one would be the Asia Cafe West. Didn't we have a bicycle hospital? We'll do the addendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| last. Okay. All right, Asia Cafe West, please give your name and address. Philip Lim, 8111| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1002)|
| 0:16:52| Gleason Drive, 37919. Okay, this is a TABC issue. These people have paid their fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| submitted a plan, but as you know, by state law, we are required to send this to the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| officer. Do I have a motion? So moved. Is there a second? Second. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| Aye. Okay, you understand that the hearing officer, you will be contacted with the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| to go before the hearing officer, and it's because you were also cited by TABC. State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| law requires that both TABC and the city beer board address your problem. So you're partway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| home to getting things solved, but not completely. Okay. I've got a question. Fire. I'm building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1052)|
| 0:17:41| Asia Cafe building on Callaghan Drive, and I'm moving from the Central Avenue Park, Callaghan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1061)|
| 0:17:51| Asia Cafe, to the new building. Okay. Now, do I have to apply for a new beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| or can I transfer? No, you'll need to apply for a new beer license, because licenses are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| site-specific. So when you go to your new location on Callaghan, we'll need to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| a license specifically for that site. When are you going to make the move? Probably breaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| ground in the next two to three months, and it will probably be, have the football field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| size restaurant. Okay. It's a big, big restaurant. Big restaurant. Yeah. When do you think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| we can all go there for dinner? Well, you can come now. Well, I know, but we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| go to the new location. Well, probably by July of next year. Okay. It will be a multi-complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| building with a tea and coffee house, Vietnamese restaurant, Asian restaurant, Mexican restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| Italian restaurant, Western restaurant, sushi. You're going to have it all. The nightclub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| I have. That's the United Nations, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to build the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| community so that I can serve the community. Okay. And also a supervised daycare in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| restaurant. All right. I should not use the word daycare, but supervised playground. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| Okay. Well, we'll look forward to seeing you again, unless you're in the county and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| the city, and they'll see you. Check us out on the Knoxville Journal. It just came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| this Friday. Okay. We need to vote on his application, or on sending this, his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| We need to vote. I need a motion to send this on to the hearing officer. We have that. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| have a motion. We have a motion and a second. All those in favor of sending this on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| hearing officers to address TABC issues, say aye. Aye. All right. Thank you, sir. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| you. All right. The other hearing is for the EDGE, and this is their second violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1182)|
| 0:19:51| within two years, and it requires an administrative hearing, which is why they're here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| and they need to submit a remedial plan and a $500 fine paid five days prior to the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| which they have done. We have two options with this one, to accept the plan as presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| or to refer it to the hearing officer. Sergeant Hunter, is TABC involved in this, or will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| they be, do you think? I don't know. I know they were cited at the time of the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| violation, but I do not know if they're going forward with any kind of hearing. Okay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| we have two choices. Councilman Della Vopi. Yes. I see that this gentleman or his company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| has submitted a plan that has you recertifying your employees, send them to training, getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| a special scanner and a number of other things, I guess. We've already done all that. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| all done. It's all done? It's all done. I brought the scanner so you could play with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| it. Okay. You know, why did the second event happen? We'd recently let go of our door guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| that we'd had since we'd opened, and we were filling in with a brother of my business partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| and he, the first night I sat with him and he was fine. The second night, I went to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| movie with my kid, and I got there about midnight, and by the time we got there, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| had already been inside. He had marked the kid over. He didn't properly check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| He pretty much failed at everything. We have a double standard from the first time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| we got caught that the bartenders are supposed to double check anyone that they don't deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| with on a regular basis, and the bartender was busy and just did not. Not just the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| person, but the bartender checks? No, the bartender did not check. He saw the armband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| and let the kid go. Just assumed he was over and went forward. Okay. Okay, but the bartender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| You think with the current training, you're going to overcome that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| The class that we take is specifically for ID. The bartenders generally don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| issue whenever they hold the ID or look at it and touch it. The issue here was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| the door. Had the bartender done his job, he would have checked it and it wouldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| been an issue, I don't think, but he did not, so it was a double fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| Counselman Greve. Explain a little bit. What happens when someone goes before a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| officer? Explain what goes on if we do, if we send him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| All right, if we send him on to the hearing officer, they will review the facts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| case, and I don't know exactly what the hearing officer will do. They can accept them as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| They can suspend the license. They could not suspend the license. I have a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| a concern because TABC did cite them that night, but TABC is running a little behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| so I'm thinking that we will probably see them again with the TABC things sooner than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| later, but the other side of the coin is that they've really taken big steps to not allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| this to happen again. Probably the brother-in-law will never be allowed in the edge again ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| but my feeling would be that we need to go ahead and let them submit this. We'll accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1372)|
| 0:23:02| it, not send them on, but if we ever see them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| What have we done with others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| We've accepted. When they've had a really complete plan and they've paid their fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| on time, typically we have accepted what they have submitted. The problem that some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| run into, and this happened to the Asia Cafe West, is that TABC has acted and so we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| have a lot of choice, and the Asia Cafe West did what they were supposed to do, but TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| and the state of Tennessee says that's not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| After we started the program where we certified everybody in the ID and class, and after we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| gotten in trouble the first time, which was the same principle the door guy had not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| it, we trained the door person, and that was our door person until the week before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| this happened, and we passed several stings that came in where they just handed it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| and said, no thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| When we train those people properly and have the time to do it, we generally don't run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| into this. We've passed a few of the stings where they've tried to come through. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| just perfect timing that they caught us with the worst case scenario. Our door person now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| has been trained through all that, and we gave them extra support and brought them a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| scanner. All you do is stick it in, slip it out, and make sure they look like the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| in the picture. Plus, you can do everything that you're supposed to do from the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| So it seems like it would be fairly hard-pressed to pass a scanner and a door person to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| inside to do something like that. It's probably a step we should have taken earlier, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| was just one of those worst case scenarios that we got stuck in, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| How long have y'all been open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Three years. And you've had at the same location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| And you've had two violations in three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| How often do y'all go out there, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| We try to hit every business at least once a year. If we have a sale, then sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| if we're having problems, we'll go back and visit that business. We have been to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| establishment a few times between the first violation and the second. I don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| exact number, but that's something I can get for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| So his statement that he's survived several stings is accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Okay. So, our decision is whether to pass it on to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| The hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| The hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Or to accept his plan and the fine that they've already paid and admonish him that we never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| want to see him again for a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Yeah, I just think that this gentleman has been sincere in his effort, and they've come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| up with a genuine plan and not just some words, and they have people certifying that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| taken the tests and taken the courses. I think we should give them the pass to go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| practice again and try to do it right and not come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| So what happens on the third violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| He automatically goes to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| He also probably will have TABC knocking on his door with a suspension and a fine, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| which case he'll come back to us and we'll have to send him to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| I'll make a motion we send it to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Well, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| You know, I think the system we have set up is that we have some discretion, and we only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| get cases that have had two violations within two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| So every instance we have like this where we have discretion, it's pretty much they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| going to have had two violations within two years, which is not great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| But to me, I think we need to really look at the plans, and if we don't feel like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| plans are good enough, then we should send them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| If not, then we should approve it as our chair has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| So, you know, to me, this seems like a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| We approved Beer and Beer Market after their second violation, and I think they've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| a third violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Yes, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And they have made very serious amends and actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| I don't think they'll have another violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| So that's sort of my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| If we think that after two violations they should automatically go to the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| we should probably just change the regulations and have that be automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| But if not, I think we need to, the decision is how bad were the violations and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| It seems that here the remedial plan is pretty thorough, and what happened was basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| an error by the doorman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| We have seen a number of remedial plans over our time on the Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| Some of them are very detailed, as is his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| Some of them are very sketchy and lead me to think that we'll see them again sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| If we don't do anything at all, if there's no motion we don't do anything at all, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| we have accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Is that correct, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| There's already a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| So there is a motion on the floor that we send him to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| So do I have a second for that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| And we had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| All those in favor of sending him to the hearing officer say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Do we need a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Let's have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Councilman Kampen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Chairwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| You will not be going to the hearing officer as a result of this from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| If TABC gets in touch with you, we will see you again about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| But we don't really want to see you for a third violation ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| We have one more, and that's the bicycle hospital, the Knoxville Bicycle Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| The one where you were going to have a beer while you waited, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| This is not an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| This is the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Tell us your name and address and what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Robert Knight, 3425 Bellevue Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| I'm requesting a 30-day extension on our beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| That was prior approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| And when was that approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Do we remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| It was cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| It was cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Actually, I know that the inspector –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| January 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| I know that the inspector was out there February 20 and made a report February 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| But what's the slowdown here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| What's the holdup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| The building department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| There was a fire in that building at one time, and the certificate of occupancy was suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| And the owner of the building did not reapply for a certificate of occupancy prior to renting it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| We had no knowledge of this until we came before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| So now the question becomes, are we held to 2014 building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| or building codes for when the building was – when it was suspended and then subsequently repaired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Have you talked to the inspections about applying for another inspection, or where are you on that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| We're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| We're still debating whether we have to – we're grandfathered to the building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| or whether we need to meet the new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| In addition to that, the building department has somehow labeled us a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and in doing so is looking at ADA-accessible bathrooms and becoming a point of assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| because of square footage above 49 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| And basically it's a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| It's a bicycle shop that wanted to sell beer to our friends after they ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Well, the inspections department, I did talk to them today to get a little bit of background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| I think that you really need to talk to the inspections department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| and make sure that you're really clear and they're really clear on what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| And if we had a motion to defer this to the June 24th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Extend, I'm sorry, to the June 24th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Please try to get this straightened out because this has been – will have been six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| and that's too long for you and it's too long for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Is there any other business before the beer board today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Being no other business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Please make sure that all of the paperwork goes to Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140527?start=1912)|
