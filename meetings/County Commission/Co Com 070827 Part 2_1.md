| 2:39:40| So this would be the first reading of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| I think we've incorporated the changes that you'd requested as far as the resolution goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9583)|
| 2:39:49| The resolution would need to be withdrawn, and we would need to vote on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:54| Make a motion to withdraw the Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| A motion made by Commissioner Craig Luto, seconded by Commissioner Trammell to withdraw Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9598)|
| 2:40:03| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| I just have a quick question, Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9606)|
| 2:40:07| I think it's a good idea that we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9607)|
| 2:40:08| What were you all thinking as to who would do the appraisal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| Would Knox County have their own independent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| I mean, I'd hate for the seller to come up with the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| I mean, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9616)|
| 2:40:17| I'm assuming we don't have an appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| Bruce Weitrick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| I was wondering, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| I'm not looking for special dispensation here, but oftentimes on our road projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| we're acquiring right-of-way slope easements, drainage easements, all sorts of things that, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9627)|
| 2:40:33| in many cases, the appraisal is going to cost more than the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| Typically, we get property appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| If we're going to purchase a house or something of that nature due to a road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9638)|
| 2:40:42| we will get an appraisal done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| But in many, many cases, we're able to negotiate with the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| and reach an equitable settlement between the county without having an appraisal done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9648)|
| 2:40:53| I just see this as being a costly measure if you apply it certainly across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| and including the Public Works Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| I'm speaking in regards to the Public Works Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| In our discussion in Finance Committee, we had talked about exempting those types of purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9662)|
| 2:41:09| and the tax sales from having to have appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| That will work perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| Bruce, I wrote in an exception for just what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| And what I've done, I've left it to the discretion of the purchasing official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9677)|
| 2:41:23| It may be that we need to address that before second reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9683)|
| 2:41:31| But what I did, I made the purchasing director, I gave the purchasing director the discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9691)|
| 2:41:39| if we were going to sell or buy a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| that the cost of an appraisal would be more than the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| I left that up to discretion of the purchasing director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| We may need to add you to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| You want to also add in your thing, we probably need to add this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| Yeah, we need to add this as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| We've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| Ordinance of first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9729)|
| 2:42:10| And what's the number on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| 07-8103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| Move that we add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| Second by Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9745)|
| 2:42:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| We voted to withdraw the other, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| Did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9751)|
| 2:42:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| Now, you want to make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| Make a motion to approve with the changes that the law director has outlined for us as far as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9755)|
| 2:42:44| It's all in the ordinance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| I'll get with Bruce and see if we need to add him to the discussion as far as whether he needs to weigh in on the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9766)|
| 2:42:57| I would think a purchase price of maybe some dollar figure, I don't know, a couple thousand dollars or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9777)|
| 2:43:04| I don't know how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| We may be able to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| Well, on appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| You're talking about placing the season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| There's also the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| The situation which we've had in place for years is typically if we can't reach an agreement with someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| we use a professional appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| We have a professional go out there and just do comps, comparable sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| They assign a square foot value to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| And it's universally applied to that road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| If we can't reach an agreement and have to go to court, then ultimately we get an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| If we're buying a house, we certainly get an appraisal done on that to make sure that everyone's being treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9816)|
| 2:43:43| But oftentimes we're buying small pieces of property and not only slows the process down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9823)|
| 2:43:49| but adds unnecessary cost to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| And we use certified appraisers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| If, in fact, we are getting an appraisal done, we absolutely use a certified appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9835)|
| 2:44:01| That's written in the ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| And a motion by Commissioner Craig Luthold, seconded by Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:18| This is a resolution to adopt the property tax freeze program as provided for in 2007 public chapter 581.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9858)|
| 2:44:25| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| And we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| Commissioner Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Mr. Chairman, the committee for the implementing the tax freeze did meet on committee day last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9876)|
| 2:44:46| We set a workshop meeting for September the 10th at 530 right here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9886)|
| 2:44:53| I invite all of you and the media and all the public to participate in this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9893)|
| 2:45:04| I think this is a very important issue, especially to our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9904)|
| 2:45:10| And the trustee is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| Mr. Fred Sisk is here and can answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| Or I can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| Or, you know, our committee had some very thoughtful questions, and I'm sure you all have some as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9920)|
| 2:45:30| Hello, Mr. Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| Everybody is welcome to come to the workshop and ask any questions that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| We are just trying to make this as easy as we can for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9936)|
| 2:45:43| September 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| September the 10th, 530 right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9944)|
| 2:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| Commissioner Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9949)|
| 2:45:50| So we don't need to adopt this yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| I guess what I'll make a motion today is to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9953)|
| 2:46:00| And if we feel that at that time that everybody's questions are answered and ready to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9960)|
| 2:46:07| then we can vote on it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| Seconded by Commissioner Cramill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| This is a question to the law director that if you could research this prior to the September 10th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| So I'll just give you what the question is I have right now is that every four years we are required to do reappraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9981)|
| 2:46:29| At that time, state law requires us to adjust the property tax rate based on that reappraisal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9989)|
| 2:46:38| The question here is that you do not get any more revenue after you do the reappraisal than you had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:46| This would, in fact, would impact some of that so that if they did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10006)|
| 2:46:51| the question is do they do it in such a way that, in fact, when we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| we would end up with less revenue, not the same revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10014)|
| 2:46:58| That would be contrary to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| So the question here is would this that you may have to do some research on to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10020)|
| 2:47:06| When we do that, that would account for the fact that if we get that tax rate equivalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10026)|
| 2:47:13| that, in fact, is an equivalent and not, say, 2% less money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| revenue would go down every time with a tax reappraisal rather than being constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| I would like to be researched so that we could have an answer September 10th and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10045)|
| 2:47:29| I think typically what happens if there's a 10%, let's say, increase in assessments across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10049)|
| 2:47:38| you basically have a 10% decrease in property tax so that it offsets and so that it's revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10058)|
| 2:47:46| If you've got a certain percent of those during a reappraisal that the tax freeze has placed a ceiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10066)|
| 2:47:56| on what their tax dollars can be, is it the equalization rate tied to the assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10076)|
| 2:48:08| or is it tied to dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| And I guess that might be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10094)|
| 2:48:15| I'll have that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| You're going to have a meeting September 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| We're going to have it September 10th, 530, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:26| Everybody's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10108)|
| 2:48:29| We've got a motion to defer 30 days until our next meeting, seconded by Commissioner Tramlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| So any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10113)|
| 2:48:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:46| We need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10129)|
| 2:48:50| This is a resolution requiring any Knox County elected official who has received both a travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10130)|
| 2:48:55| and a county vehicle in violation of Knox County Code Section 2-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| to reimburse Knox County the full amount of the travel allowance received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10140)|
| 2:49:04| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10144)|
| 2:49:05| Intergovernmental voted 7-2 to defer this pending the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| Finance committee voted to defer it 10-0 with amendment pending the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10151)|
| 2:49:18| and that was for the law director to act immediately on it when he got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10163)|
| 2:49:29| I think I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| I don't know if we need to get a motion before we have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| To defer pending the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| Seconded by Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10180)|
| 2:49:41| Richard, when is the audit supposed to be released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10181)|
| 2:49:48| The audit will be responded to by Friday, August 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10188)|
| 2:49:54| And once we get the response, we will need some time to analyze the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10194)|
| 2:49:59| and also go through the state for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| So that could be, say, a week possibly after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10203)|
| 2:50:11| I think, you know, we need to deal with it in a public setting because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10211)|
| 2:50:17| we're not supposed to talk and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| we don't want to get the wrong information out to the news media or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| So my suggestion would be a date that's as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| Maybe we set it tonight just to have a special call meeting to discuss that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10228)|
| 2:50:32| and let the law director tell us if there's any violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10232)|
| 2:50:37| and if they are to what extent they arise to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| And that way we can try to make an informed decision to correct the measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10240)|
| 2:50:46| or if there are policies in place that are sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10246)|
| 2:50:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| I'm all in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| I think if we can come in and everybody get the information at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| we all have an opportunity to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| We can all listen to one another and the types of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| So I would be all in favor of having a meeting where Mr. Walls presents his findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| and we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| I'm trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| He's saying probably the week after Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| The response is due back Friday and we'll need some time to analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| So probably approximately a week depending on the review of the state also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10281)|
| 2:51:26| You think you could have it done by the following Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| What would that be, the 7th of September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10289)|
| 2:51:34| So we've got, what, Monday is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| So that would allow four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10296)|
| 2:51:37| You might want to put it off until possibly the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10297)|
| 2:51:41| Well, that puts us in the middle of our trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| So I, you know, meet at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| We can meet at 530, 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| If we're all subpoenaed so there's not a good chance we'll be in the building anyway sometime after the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10315)|
| 2:52:03| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10323)|
| 2:52:04| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10324)|
| 2:52:05| Can we just not say at this time that we give you the authority to call a special meeting upon the audit being released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10325)|
| 2:52:16| Mr. Owens, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| You need to be more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| You need to be specific because whatever purpose the meeting is called for, it will be strictly construed and followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10341)|
| 2:52:31| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| There are some notice requirements that we need to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| There's if you can certainly vote to authorize the chair to call a special meeting, say, within the next 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10356)|
| 2:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10365)|
| 2:52:46| And if you vote tonight in order to give the chair the authority to do that, then he can call it within 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10366)|
| 2:52:56| But he would only have up to 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| There's no less than two, no more than 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| What about I think we're all going to be here on September the 11th anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10382)|
| 2:53:06| So could we say 430 on September the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10386)|
| 2:53:12| Mr. Walls, do you think that that would be done by that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10392)|
| 2:53:16| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10396)|
| 2:53:17| Well, we'll be in the throes of a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10397)|
| 2:53:22| Yes, selecting a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10402)|
| 2:53:23| At 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:24| Selecting a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| Could we handle it as a workshop as far as giving out the information and then just vote on it at the regular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10405)|
| 2:53:35| If we have a workshop, I don't know if you could have any votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| You vote on it at the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| Well, I think in my mind the people want us to take care of business as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| and we don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Let's have it at 7 o'clock, and that way that would give the public plenty of time to get here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| We're going to be here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| By the time we're out of court in a week, it will be 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10436)|
| 2:54:00| What about 7 o'clock on September the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| Well, hopefully we're all going to be here on September the 10th to talk about the tax freeze, which is Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:10| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| You think, Mr. Wiles, that possibly it could be done by September the 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10452)|
| 2:54:19| What time are you talking about, September 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| Well, the tax freeze is going to be talked about at 530, and it's possible we could discuss, have this after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10462)|
| 2:54:34| I'll know more Friday based on the response, but that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10474)|
| 2:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| Just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| Since we already have a workshop called for, I have a workshop called for on the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10484)|
| 2:54:53| and then we could have a special meeting to immediately follow that since we're already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10493)|
| 2:54:59| most of us are going to be here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10499)|
| 2:55:02| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10502)|
| 2:55:03| Commissioner Lutho, maybe we'll just hold yours until 7 o'clock, hold it an hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| and start that one at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| What if we do it September the 10th at 7 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:15| Do we need an hour and a half for the tax freeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| I don't think that the, well, I don't know how long it's going to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10517)|
| 2:55:23| Obviously, it will last however long it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| I don't think it would take an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| Can we simply not, if that's a public meeting that's going to be called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| can we simply not say immediately following the tax freeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| That's what I was, you know, suggesting, Commissioner Cate, is that to do it immediately following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10537)|
| 2:55:42| and we just go from one right into the other and hopefully it won't take too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:49| But I do hope people are here and have to let their views be known and have their questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10549)|
| 2:55:56| That's what the workshop's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10556)|
| 2:55:57| I don't want to rush through it just to rush through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| but it's just a suggestion that since we already have this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10559)|
| 2:56:06| and if we're just talking about moving this up one day, it seems like a good opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10566)|
| 2:56:13| It's at 5.30, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| The workshop starts at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| Why don't we say it's 6.30 or immediately following the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10577)|
| 2:56:21| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| And it won't be before 6.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| 6.30 or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| Do I need to make that as a motion or can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10593)|
| 2:56:34| I'll make it as a motion seconded by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:38| Commissioner Smith, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10599)|
| 2:56:40| Real quick, Mr. Walz, we're just going to be talking about the travel allowance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10600)|
| 2:56:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10604)|
| 2:56:45| Auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| I mean the auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| The auto allowance audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| So whatever's in it, I think we'd be covered with the special call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| Just real quick, if all we're going to do is we're going to do more than just receive the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10620)|
| 2:57:06| we're going to possibly come back to the motion of asking for that money to be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10626)|
| 2:57:11| Is that not part of what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| So we need to make that part of the agenda, do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| We're doing more than just receiving an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| We don't know what we're going to do yet because we've not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| But you've got to be very specific about special call means you have to be very specific about what you're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10644)|
| 2:57:31| If all we do is receive it, then that's all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| If you're wanting to do something about it that night, then we need to have on there possible actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10654)|
| 2:57:40| Discussion and possible actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| Discussion and possible actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| Can anybody tell me what it will, will it show the actual payouts of that or will it just be a summary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10666)|
| 2:57:52| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| That would be up to Mr. Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| Well, you would if it's public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| I'd like to see all the transactions myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| I think it probably will, wouldn't it, Mr. Walz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| I mean, you'll either show that people were receiving it with a county vehicle or they didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10685)|
| 2:58:09| I mean, I think the facts will speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| Well, I think they've been, that it was gone to pay flowers and candies or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10691)|
| 2:58:17| I'd like to see what it was paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| Those are two different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| You may be talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10703)|
| 2:58:24| You're probably going to be talking about two different things because I think the auto allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| and the budgets are approved for auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| And in my mind, I don't think you can transfer those funds or say that you're going to use them for something else unless you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10711)|
| 2:58:37| go back to commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10717)|
| 2:58:40| I mean, that's something we can discuss as September 10th gets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10720)|
| 2:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10725)|
| 2:58:46| Is there any more discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| So the motion includes receiving and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10728)|

| 3:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:27| Now, I just got a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| As we go forward, we're going to have more and more and more and more of these stormwater management facilities to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10889)|
| 3:01:35| We might want to think about creating a section on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| They're all recommended and just lump them all into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10899)|
| 3:01:42| And we can't put it on consent or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10905)|
| 3:01:46| The law director needs about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| I mean 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| Yeah, thanks a lot after 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| Just quickly, we have an audit service agreement with the office of the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10914)|
| 3:01:59| They have advised that they need to be reimbursed for the actual cost of the work that they're performing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10919)|
| 3:02:07| They have some estimates of their cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| The estimates are that the auditor time per auditor is around $50 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10930)|
| 3:02:18| And that's based on July 1 salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10938)|
| 3:02:22| But they say that that figure will not exceed $50 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| Mileage at 46 cents per mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| Meals, which is the auditor per diem, is $49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| Hotel per night, $74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10953)|
| 3:02:36| And parking at $8 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| What they have advised me is they did a pretty extensive audit over in another county regarding a sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10961)|
| 3:02:51| And at the end of that audit, they had billed that county some $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10971)|
| 3:02:59| So they seem to think that this would not be more than the $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10979)|
| 3:03:05| It depends on how much time they're willing to give us in order to help Mr. Walls and his department in coming up with the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10985)|
| 3:03:15| Does this encompass all three audits or maybe four now that we're going to have moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=10995)|
| 3:03:22| They've been assisting already with the travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| They will be assisting and are right now assisting with the PCARD issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11006)|
| 3:03:33| And we'll see if they're going to assist us with the hospitality account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11013)|
| 3:03:39| Do you need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11019)|
| 3:03:40| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11020)|
| 3:03:41| Just giving you the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11024)|
| 3:03:45| And this concludes our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11025)|
| 3:03:46| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=11026)|
