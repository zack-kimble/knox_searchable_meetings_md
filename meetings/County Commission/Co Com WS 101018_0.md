| 0:03:37| The other half will be paid for by the Fort Sanders – no, I'm sorry about that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| I also would like to add a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| for pregnancy prevention to expand our current services to the amount of $602,846| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=232)|
| 0:04:01| for the first year renewable over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| I would like to defer item number 19, and the reason is I have begun my monthly meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| with the chairman of the chairperson of the school board, Ms. Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| and in our meeting she had reminded me that on the Carter Elementary Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| that we had asked the school board to take a look at that with the newly constituted school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| and have any discussions and then come back to us with their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| And we had done that, and so I told her that I would withdraw it until after the school board has met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| and I believe they're going to do that in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| So I want to withdraw that until after the school board has met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| and we will see what action, if any, they choose to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| So anything that needed to be added, added, withdrawn, withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Do I hear a motion that we – is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Do I hear a motion that we approve those minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| I have a consent – items for consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and, again, if anyone would like to pull one of these off, feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=329)|

| 0:05:47| 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| And the discussion item shouldn't take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Does that agree with everyone on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Does anyone like to pull one off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| I'd like to ask on number 8, we have – never mind, I figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| On number 20, I would like to just speak to that for a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| We'll go ahead and pull it off and you'll have an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| We'll go ahead and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| Okay, Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| On page 1, item number 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| ratifying the Knox County Mayor's appointment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| and appointing to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Since we do not have names, would someone like to make a motion that we pass this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Or I don't guess we need to pass it on, but just not take no action until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| Move that we take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Second. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| On page 2, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| appointing members representing the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 9th districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| to the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Commissioner Briggs has already put Mr. Schoonmaker's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Does anyone else have a name that they would like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| I'd like to re-nominate Carson Daly to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Mr. Carson Daly from the 9th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Does anyone else have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| No, but I'd like to announce that today at 6 o'clock at the National Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| I will be having a public forum to vet the candidates for the 1st district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| So, Mr. Lauder, would it be appropriate to make a motion that Mr. Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| and Mr. Daly's names be added and then we look at the other names on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| That's certainly appropriate if that's the Commission's desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Item number 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| appointing as an alternate member to the Knox County Sheriff's Office Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Resolution 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Move that we take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| There was no name that I had seen, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| We'll take no action until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| So, no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| And there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| appointing Commissioner to serve on the Knox County Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Resolution 114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Mr. Law Director, this is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| I was looking for a name from the Commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| I thought that we had a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Mr. Shouse, were you not on the Investment Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| I spoke to this at your lunch two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| I used to attend the Investment Committee just as an interested party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| and Commissioner Leuthold attended and Commissioner Pinkston attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| I think Commissioner Pinkston was the actual member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Maybe Commissioner Leuthold was there as the trustee's representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| And I asked the law director to just, I guess, research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| And it wasn't when we had our meeting to discuss who filled what committee slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| It never hit the radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| So that's what I was asking what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| I would like to serve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| In the past, he was the chair of the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Yes, that's why Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| I move that we appoint Ed Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Ed Shouse will be the representative on the Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| On page 3, item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| Let's see, number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| On page 2, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| appointing Commissioner Jeff Hornby to the CTV Board Resolution 116.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| I had talked with the law director, and he had sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| As it stands now, the chairman of the Cable TV Committee is automatically a member on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| and I was not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| So I believe that's Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| So do you wish to serve on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| They meet quarterly, and if you wish to serve, this is your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| But if you want to designate someone, then that's your designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Well, I guess my only question is I know that Commissioner Hornby has some affiliation with Cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| I didn't know if that would serve as a conflict or anything, and I'm looking at the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| I had asked the law director about that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| He did not seem to think it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| But, again, this is your appointment unless you want to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| We're at the situation now where the majority of these entities have elected to opt out of a local franchise agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| and instead be regulated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| If Commissioner McKenzie designates Commissioner Hornby, provided Mr. Hornby recuses himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| for anything that deals with his entity or a competitor, we shouldn't have any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| But, again, there's not a lot left to regulate because most of these have gone to a state franchise agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| You know, and, again, I don't mind doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| I guess what I don't want is from this board, if there isn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| Comcast is a pretty big player in this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| So I don't want it to be perceived as we're trying to strong arm the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| or stack the deck or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| So, again, if the law director is comfortable with that's not going to be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| I'd happily yield my appointment to Commissioner Hornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| Make a motion we move it to consent next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| So, Mr. Hornby, you're comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| On page three, item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| approving a contract with Cherokee Health Systems for a primary care provider for children of 10K| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| or covered kids or those without insurance, resolution 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Dr. Buchanan, if you wouldn't mind coming to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Do I hear a motion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Or do you want to wait for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Defer to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Okay, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| I'm happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| You want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| You said that they had addressed some of the issues that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| And what has happened since the last time I was before you regarding this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| in talking with Cherokee's CEO, Dennis Freeman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| they are agreeable to address the rent, not immediately, but at a future date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| because of issues with the way they can access the money that allows them to make up that difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| They have to get that site designated as a federally qualified health center, which takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| It's a federal application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| They have to ask permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| The feds have to designate it as a federally qualified health center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| So they won't be pulling down those dollars immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| It will take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| And, again, they're going to have some start-up costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| We're going to have to probably hire an office manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| which is what I would have to do if this doesn't go through also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| And so there's some start-up costs and some time before they'll start making any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| They'll be getting their 26 cents on the dollar from TennCare at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| which really is really hard to make ends meet and ask any physician in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| So they were requesting that we start looking at paying rent maybe at a year or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| and at a rate determined by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| I didn't want to put a rate in there because that rate can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| PBA determines the rates that they pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| It's a per square footage rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Right now it's $11.99 per square foot in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| All of our buildings have a different fee service based on the needs in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| But for that building, it's currently $11.99 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| And that's a very reasonable office space rent for anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| And that covers utilities, janitorial services and space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| So that's where we are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Dr. McKenna, we talked last month about employees being treated going over and getting the same benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Did I read the contract wrong where it said the maximum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Let's say we have a 15-year employee and they go over to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| The maximum they'll accrue is a five-year employee of the Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| That's not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Where did I read that at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Maybe that's their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| But there's no maximum in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| So a 15-year employee at the county is going to be a 15-year employee at Cherokee benefit-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Based on what their benefit package is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| And I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with their benefit package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| I'll re-look at what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I just saw that the maximum was five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| I think that's in their benefit package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| And I haven't looked at their benefit package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| So it's not the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| They're going to be grandfathered in and treated equal to any Cherokee employee who's been there for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| I know last month a couple of commissioners, Commissioner Anders and also Commissioner Brewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| had some questions of Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| I have a meeting set up at 1.30 on Wednesday at Cherokee with Dr. Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| If anybody would like to go, I need to know now so we can get Jolie to sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| So if anybody would like to go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Is that Dr. Freeman you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| You said Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| I wasn't sure who that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Freeman, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Yes, we'll have his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| And he is very happy to meet with any and all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| I just thought it might be easier, you know, him and everybody else if we get two or three to go, one or two to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Now, Commissioner Zander's suggestion is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Let's go ahead and sunshine it, Jolie, so that in the event people do, then it's properly done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Ma'am, could you refresh me on how much or where Knox County will be saving in the transfer of this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Initially, it will be about $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| But then if they start reimbursing us for use of the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| obviously our realization of savings will change because we won't be paying for that space anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| And when we're paying for those utilities and we won't be paying for the janitorial services that we now pay PBA for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| So it will actually go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| On the flip side, if we don't do this contract, I will need to hire a new pediatrician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| and an office manager, and that's going to push our cost up probably closer to $500,000 to run this clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=985)|
| 0:16:34| in excess of what they bring in because a pediatrician with benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| and an office manager with benefits will cost quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| You can ask her that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| I was trying to get at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| I don't know what I remember about insurance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| If we, Knox County, handle it, is there a difference between what we can receive from various streams of cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1017)|
| 0:17:08| versus this private, well, 501C3 handling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| What makes up the difference is that federally qualified health center status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Because of the fact that Cherokee is a federally qualified health center, when we bill TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| which is the only insurance we bill, they pay us 26 cents on the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| That's pretty easy math to see that that doesn't really make up your costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| When Cherokee bills TennCare, they get the same 26 cents per dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| but then they also pull down federal money to make up that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| So they get much closer to 100% of what they bill than anybody else in town does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1060)|
| 0:17:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Martha, you talk about that we need, you know, you'd have to hire somebody, a pediatric doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| and an office manager, you're looking at $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| What are we doing now for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| You did not have a doctor in there before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| My pediatrician is retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| That's what started this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Well, then that should still be in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| I mean, I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| The numbers that I'm providing you don't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| I didn't count his salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| I took him out, and that's maybe my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| But it's probably actually more savings than I have given you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| Because I just took that out because we're not, he's retiring, so I just took that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| I just want to, you know, compare apples to apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| And another thing that sort of comes to me is, you know, they came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| You went to them and asked them to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| No, I put out an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I was transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| My pediatrician was retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| And I thought, we need a different model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| We can't continue subsidizing TennCare the way we are and spending the county's money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| So I thought of a different way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| And a different way to do this is for somebody to contract it out for somebody else who does outpatient medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| who does pediatric care, who does TennCare to come in and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| So we wrote an RFQP, whichever it was, and we had inquiries from Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| We had inquiries from other pediatric practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| And the only bidder was Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| So, no, they did not come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| We put out an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| It originated from that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Mr. Chairman, would it help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| I mean, we're doing some stuff here, and we don't have PBA here to talk on behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| I'd sort of like to hear and ask some questions of PBA and get their feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| And I don't know, Joe, if he feels that way or for other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| But, you know, we're letting a lot of Knox County property go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| and we need to hear from PBA what their thoughts are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| So would you like to move this without a recommendation or move it to money without a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| So I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| No, we still have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| So I guess I don't see a lot of questions for PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| It sounds like this $12 per square foot was arrived at by some means and method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| I guess my bigger question, and either in the meeting with Commissioner Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| or on Monday, what I'd like to see, and it kind of gets to what Brad was asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| I'd like to see a side-by-side comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| What Nurse John made at Knox County in terms of benefits, what he paid for family health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1233)|
| 0:20:44| what was his 401K giving, all of that stuff, what the county provided Nurse John as a benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| this whole salary fringe package, max vacation, methods of accrual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| and over here what Nurse John is going to be transitioning into at Cherokee, just kind of a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| And I'm not expecting things to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Some things are going to be better on the Cherokee side of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Some things are going to be worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Vacation may not be as good, but the amount that the employee portion of the contribution to health care may be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| So I'd like to see that so that we can do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| That's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I thought I provided some of that to you all before, but perhaps I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| It kind of didn't get into, and that may have been what Brad was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| I think it didn't get into what the difference was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| There was a chart that specified employee A through E, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| and it said that their family insurance would be this much here and it's this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| and only a few families are going to pay more, and it's by the less than $10 or $20 a month more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| What I'm concerned about is there's a lot of things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| we have more holidays here in the county than they do at Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Just three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Three more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| And that's three days all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| I mean, if Cherokee doesn't have a facility to send them to, they have to take an annual day, so they lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| We haven't figured that out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| That's why I want to make sure that we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And so there's a lot of things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| Commissioner Broyles brought up the past with Cherokee not being able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| appointments being a month or two out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| That concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| You know, my kids are sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| I want to be able to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| The thing is, is we're going to have the same number of providers, the same number of appointment slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| so access is going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| But the name has changed and the reputation precedes the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| and I want to make sure we're doing right by Knox County's kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| That's all I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| And, you know, I think it's a good thing to do for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Yeah, I wondered, I don't know if the PBA can really answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| I know there's some questions about the rent that you're paying for square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| That's from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| That's the number from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| I mean, how does that compare with the private market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Because PBA doesn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| For that location and what it's doing as an off-campus by off-campus, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| away from a hospital site where you're paying, you know, premium dollar, it's probably fairly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| We looked at a much better location not too long ago as an off-hospital site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| and it was about $14, but it was still in a much better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| So I think if, you know, $12 is probably in the ballpark just to try to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| to help out with that part of it, because PBA is not going to be able to help you too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| because they're not in that commercial, medical, real estate, rental, leasing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| Like you, from my previous life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| we actually paid $24 a square foot near East Town Mall for less than what I would consider prime location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| But that's the extreme other end of what you can pay for office space for medical office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Dr. Buchanan, about how much square foot will their clinic take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| It's right around 6,800 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| 6,800?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Right around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| That's the current space that the pediatric staff is using now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Marthy, tell us just again real quick, Wednesday, is it 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| I'm sorry, you'll have to ask Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| 1.30 at Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Seeing Dr. who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Dr. Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Dr. Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I hope it's Freeman, or you called the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| I meant to ask you this, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| I had my light on and forgot, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| You know, we talked about how Cherokee can get the reimbursement from TennCare plus a premium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| because of their unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| If you had a private doctor's office or the people from Children's or some of these others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| that could have potentially bid on this, would they have gotten the same advantage that Cherokee gets or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| This is something that's unique to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| It's unique to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| And the federal government allows for only so many federally qualified health centers per region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| And the reason it takes time is that they actually have to prove that the site qualifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| We know it will qualify because it's just a TennCare clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| And because of the population it serves, it will qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| They limit those for obvious reasons because there are only so many people that need to be served by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| This is going to go without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| We'll address it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| And I believe that's all for the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| All those in favor say aye to any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| It will be heard Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| What about the thing that I added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Do I need to stick around for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Can we go ahead and address that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Is that a women's health grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| It's from the Department of It will involve women's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| There will be a contract later with women's health, but that's not part of it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| It's a contract from the Department of Human Services, Department of Adolescent Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| for pregnancy prevention using evidence-based prevention methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| and case managing young women who are coming in to seek birth control anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| seek contraceptive management anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| So they're assigned to a case manager who's going to teach them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| and help them make an informed decision about what they want to do regarding birth control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| So it will address all possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Joe, did we get a copy of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| We do not have a resolution number for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| It was just added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Joe, do we need a resolution number on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Yes, I'd prefer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| I guess we'll move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Let's just move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I don't think there will be an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| We'll move it on without a recommendation and address it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Can I go back for just one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| The appointment I have on Wednesday, he was expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Dr. Freeman is expecting a one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| I'll probably call him Peterson when I get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| But if anybody's planning on going, let me know so I can set that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| so I can, you know, firm it up and tell him that we're going to be three of us or two of us or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| And an abundance of caution, Commissioner, let's just notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| And then if two or more show up, you're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| If no one shows up, rather than trying to determine who's going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| why don't we just do a notice of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| We're already going to do that, but I think it would be nice if I could say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| I've got three people coming or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| They may change the meeting room or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Do we have a motion and a second to send it on without a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| It is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| We'll address it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| On page four, item 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1671)|
| 0:27:59| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| creating a sesquicentennial commission comprised of experts in history, education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| marketing and tourism to oversee county's participation in the sesquicentennial recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| of the United States Civil War and authorizing Knox County Mayor to appoint said experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| and to take any action necessary in the formation and organization of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| sesquicentennial commission resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| I'd like to take a couple minutes to give a little bit of history on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| About a month or so ago, I met with Carol Evans, Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| Steve Dean from Channel 10 who filmed all of the Heartland series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| and Joan Markle from McClung Museum to try to see who was doing what for the sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1722)|
| 0:28:53| At that point, it's like, and you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| a lot of different groups from the Buffalo Soldiers to the DAR to everybody else or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| has kind of been doing their own little thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| So to keep from having duplication, I mean, this could be one giant windfall for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| This is going to be a two-year celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| We thought it would be good, and we talked to the mayor about appointing this commission to be kind of like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| clearinghouse headquarters so that if, and I have a list here that I'll get to each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| I've got ten names so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| I can, you know, have them for you on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| But representatives from all of these organizations that will be involved in it, getting together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| planning what we can and will do for that sesquicentennial celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| It will start in Nashville, but it will end here in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| On the 5th of November, over across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| they've already contacted Blunt Mansion about using that probably as their information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| downtown information headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| They've already moved some stuff over there from McClung in preparation for this 5th kickoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Everybody will be getting an invitation to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| The state's not kicking it off until I think the 16th or 17th of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| But with all of the acquisition of the parks and everything that we have here locally, as I said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| this could be a giant windfall for Knox County if we promote it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| In talking after we met with the mayor and naming a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| we do have one big step that's already been taken that can be a great help for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| in an organization called the East Tennessee Civil War Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| It's already set up as a 501C3 corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| They've already been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| As a matter of fact, Steve Dean and Joan Booth are in that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| They would be the depository or repository for any money coming in to help promote this and fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1868)|
| 0:31:21| So that part's already taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| So what we need to do is make them, the East Tennessee Civil War Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| the official commission for the sesquicentennial celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| So I'll answer any questions anybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| We also have some professors at the University of Tennessee who are considered national experts on the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| So getting them involved in this type of thing might be something to consider as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| Commissioner McKenzie, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Well, similarly, I guess, and I don't know what Commissioner Brown's list looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| but I know I really would like someone from the Beck Cultural Enrichment Center to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| put the African-American experience of that war as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| So if you didn't have one, I'd like to make that a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| Well, this committee would, it will not just involve the members that are on that basic committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| It will involve everybody from tourism to Beck to the Buffalo Soldiers to the Civil War Roundtable, McClung, UT, Fred Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1936)|
| 0:32:29| Anybody who has any expertise in the Civil War will be invited to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1949)|
| 0:32:38| But I agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| This is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| I think it can bring a lot of attention and a lot of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| but also an opportunity to bring some extra folks into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| I'd ask the mayor if he could come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| They need a little bit of start-up money for that event on the 5th over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| I asked him if he could come up with $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| He said he wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| So since it is a 501C3 organization, we've got 11 people on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1980)|
| 0:33:11| If everybody gave $100, we could kind of get a kickoff over there and have a nice event on the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| Just throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| But you can put me down for $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| I don't want to put any pressure on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| But, you know, go ahead and have them get together the paperwork and get it to Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Is there a motion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| So is the motion to put it on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| The motion is to go ahead and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Yes, put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| We could see that list then, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Yeah, I'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| I can pass it around now, but this is not the complete one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Yeah, so let's send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| That way he has time to put it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| We have it for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Motion to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| It will go without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Page 5, item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| amending Article IV of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance to add a new section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| 4.103, regarding standards and requirements for flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Ordinance number 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Ordinance 101 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Mark Donaldson wants to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| I can tell that he can't wait to get down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| So, Mr. Donaldson, if you would come, and also Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I believe this is yours, if you'd like to make any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Or wait until Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| I'll put it on Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| I would have been happy to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Brad, I understand you've had a conversation with Mr. Seymour about the business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| Yeah, I kind of, after I read it and looked at it, I wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| the way the ordinance reads, each vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| the only problem I had was that each vendor would have to get a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| a business license from the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I think it would be more appropriate that the operator have the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| and I believe there's state law that they have to remit that to the clerk anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Yeah, state law provides the option to either the individual vendor to get a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| or the owner-operator to collect it on a daily basis and turn that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| So I have no problem with amending that to whatever language you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| or would you like to ask to propose some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| I can get with Joe and have him redraw it before Monday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| but I would like to make it to where it's the operator of the flea market, not every vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| Because if somebody chooses just to, you know, spend the weekend there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| and get rid of some of their stuff, they don't want to have to come up here and get a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| I don't think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| That was the only question I had and comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I know this is still in sort of the line of a proposal, and I agree with you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| I believe it was in the media about the place that we were driving by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| that we probably would like to see better controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| They had vendor's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| So vendor's license must not be controlling the situation that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2177)|
| 0:36:28| Another question, though, that I sort of looked at was that all flea market sites have to be greater than five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| Does that mean that someone with a good acre and a half can't have a flea market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| that they can't comply with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| How would they go about becoming compliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| Could they go to BZA and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Yes, this would be a dimensional requirement of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| so they would have the ability to make an application to BZA to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| And I don't have a, you know, the five acres doesn't, you know, if it was three, it wouldn't bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| And the same with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| What I was going to get at was that the BZA being in control of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| may put some people at a hardship of coming up with the money to go get a BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| So maybe we need to discuss the size of the parcel a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| And then there's also the one on the parking, each 400 square feet of designated vendor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2247)|
| 0:37:37| What's the size of a parking space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| 600 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| A typical parking space is 20 by 10, so 200 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| So for every one, for every, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| I'm beginning to see the parking lot being bigger than the vendor lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| I just envision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| I mean, any business, you've got to have appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| I mean, any business, you have a restaurant, you've got to have appropriate parking per allowable member in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| And I'm not disagreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I'm just saying of how much space that exists in flea markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| I sometimes wonder if the parking lot is larger than the flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| That's all I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| The issue that brought this up was people parking on the fog line of following highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| That was the issue that brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| And I visited that right after you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| I agree completely with the occurrence that's happening on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| It's unacceptable at that one location that made the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| So I'm not in disagreement with the resolution or ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| or however we want to go about controlling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| I just think there are still issues in here that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Does someone have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| I'll make a motion we send it without recommendation for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| Item number 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| meeting Knox County Code Chapter 2, Article 8, Division 2, Section 2.496,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| relative to composition in terms of members of the Knox County Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| This is ordinance number 0-05-6-104, adopted July 25, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| This is on second reading, ordinance 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Mr. Jarrett, what exactly does this do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| I know that we've passed it on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| but it's taking off the finance chair and making it a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Essentially, you had some arcane language ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| I shouldn't say arcane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| but the change in the language is a result of going to this particular body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| So this essentially is administrative housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| but because the original language was promulgated by an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| it must be amended by an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| This will not be put on consent because it is an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| so it will be heard again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Commission items on number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I had talked with Mr. Jarrett as a result of our meeting regarding BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| and also I've had some phone calls from people on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| And also I know Mr. Donaldson from time to time has told us that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| according to the state law, has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Mr. Jarrett has suggested, and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| that we have some type of workshop to talk about the zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| what our obligations are, what the obligations are of MPC, BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| and also talk about changes in the law so that we're fully up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| And also some of the, I hate to use the word nuances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| but some of the things that they do on MPC and BZA that we need to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| For example, I received a phone call from a constituent who was wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| build a deck, a screened-in porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| They contacted a member of the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| and they were told that they had been instructed that they could not speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| citizens about what they wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| I thought that was a bit odd, and I called Mr. Jarrett's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| and he said no, that the person had misinterpreted what the law department had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| MPC commissioners have called me and said that their policy, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| this is, I believe it's a state attorney general opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| is that they cannot go out and meet with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Again, I find that a bit odd, but if that's the policy, that's the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| But these are just things I think we need to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| because I was not aware of some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| But just to get clarification, so if you feel this is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| we could take the chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| I think we'd meet about an hour, and we could just spend the time asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| and getting up to speed on this, if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| We could do that in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I'm going to be away in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| And we're going to be at Fullerton in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| I mean, we could still do it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Let's move it to December, just so we don't have to have that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Or we could have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Or we could do it before the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| Well, I don't think there's a huge rush to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| But I guess one of the questions I have is I like everything that you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| but maybe to the law director there's something, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| a little stronger statement that in terms of what the body, the BZA, is empowered to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| So things like that, not to meet with constituents, if that's just been kind of their form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| but we may think it makes for bad governance, can we instruct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2560)|
| 0:42:48| If you don't have an issue with it, if you agree that it's not a violation of state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| can we instruct them that, hey, you may need to get more engaged with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| and answer phone calls and take visits if you're so compelled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| Well, the commissioner and members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| essentially your power and authority lies in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| And to ensure uniformity, this is something that should be codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| and probably something that would come out in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| But in a nutshell, you're trying to avoid any awe of impropriety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| or somebody feeling that because they're represented by an attorney who can walk the halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| and talk to commissioners but a homeowner association may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| The problem is not so much in the communication but how that is communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| In other words, one thing is someone emoting to a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| It's another thing when the board member gives the impression that she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| or he has prejudged the case, is going to vote a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| And there's also the problem of not disclosing it during the course of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| That's the biggest rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| Mr. Andrews was telling me that at our November workshop that we could do this right after the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| So let's say we're done by 3, 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| We could just go ahead and set it for 4 o'clock and do it that way if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| That way we don't have to come down for two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| We have one and we can go ahead and knock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Because it may take more than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| So let's plan on doing that, Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Mark, is that okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| So we'll do that November after the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| We'll have another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| Or we could even add that as the last item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Mark and I already have meetings scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| And we'll certainly, I don't want to speak for Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| but I think we can be prepared for a formal presentation to give you some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| I want to come back to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| I'll come back to number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Number 28, in the past with regards to our meeting dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| because of Christmas and Thanksgiving we have moved everything up a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Is that the wish of the commission to instead of having it the 3rd on November, December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| we have our workshop on the 2nd Monday, our formal meeting on the 3rd Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| That way we're not meeting the week of Thanksgiving or the week of Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| As long as it doesn't conflict with Lady Vol basketball, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| Men Vols, that's okay, but not Lady Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| So we will, if it's okay, we'll go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| I had asked Commissioner Boyles to look into the possibility on number 29| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| of having our November commission meeting at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Fulton High School says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I've talked to Mr. Oaks this morning, and Mr. Oaks is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| But he says that they are prepared to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| They can stream it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| They can get it on CTV so that it can be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| I guess the only question I have is can it be recorded for the clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| It can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| So yes, the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| So everything is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| The idea would be we would do the chairman's lunch at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| I'd like the opportunity to sit down with some of the administrators at Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| to hear some of the great things that they're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Also, I thought members of the student government could join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| and just kind of have a roundtable discussion about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| We would have our regular meeting, and then once the meeting is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| we would leave and come back here for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| That would seem to be the way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| That way they wouldn't have to stay over there past 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| So if that's agreeable with everybody, our November meeting will be at Fulton at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| I think it will be a good opportunity for us to have some good interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| That would be on the 15th then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| The agenda item deadline, in talking with Joe Lee about the agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| I think that we have kind of allowed folks to add items at will after the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| and that has created a bit of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| What I would like to suggest that we look at is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| if an item needs to be added after the deadline, that it's the chairman's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| In other words, they would have to call the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| and the chair would say, this makes sense, let's do it, or let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| But we're getting a lot of items that are coming in after the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Some of them you can't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| They have a fiscal note attached to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| But some things could wait, but it's just creating some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| If you don't like that idea, I mean, I'm just saying it doesn't matter who the chair is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| but to me I think there needs to be a little bit of structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| rather than just a flurry of things coming in after the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| I just throw that out because it has been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| I think it also needs to be in written form, kind of like we had three dropped on us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| that weren't in written form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| I don't want to vote on something I can't read and look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| What I'm trying to do here is trying to get everybody back into some semblance of structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| so that they know we do have a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| And, again, things happen, and if any commissioner wants to add something, you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| and we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| But I'm just saying that rather than you have a lot of things start coming through the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| because folks for some reason forgot the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| I'd like for them to know that there is a deadline and that we need to pursue that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| So does anyone have any heartburn over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| For your information, just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| One is that I have started my monthly meetings with Ms. Kin Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| I met with Jolie and Drusilla as far as commission office operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| They are now providing me with e-mails if they're going to be gone on vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| or if they need to be gone to the doctor or whatever, again, just so we have record keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| And they have been very gracious in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| The second thing is I feel like that it's important for you to see what our budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| We do have a commission budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| And so each month you're going to be receiving a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| And so feel free to look over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| If you have any questions, we'll be happy to answer any of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| But you see where the commission money is going and you see how it's being spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| and you'll be getting that on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| I had asked about the commission meeting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| And Jolie, if you could help me pass this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| This will just take a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| I'd like to refer this to the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| This is just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| And you all feel free to say yay, nay, or give any other suggestions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2941)|
| 0:49:10| But basically, in looking at our time and how we could allocate our time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| I'm suggesting that we do the chairman's lunch from, say, 11.15 to 12.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| that we have that break from 12.30 to 1.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| We do the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| We take a break for beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I'm suggesting that at 1.45 we go into session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| and that that's where we have our public forum for non-agenda items and honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| There have been a couple of times, I know of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| where I've asked people to come down here to be honored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| and at 2.00 we go into session and it's 3.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| they're still sitting here waiting to get their resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I don't think we honor people by making them endure county commission meetings for an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| So if we're going to bring people and ask them to be here to honor them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| I think that we need to do that and have a set time so that they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| if they're going to take off from work to be here that we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| and we don't make them sit in the audience for a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| And then we start our commission meeting at 2.00 and we have our zonings at 6.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| So I'm just recommending that we send this to the rules committee for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And, again, this can be we don't have to do it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| you might want to do it this way, or you might have some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| So, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| I'm going to speak on behalf of the chairman, who may not realize he has a conflict here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| but, you know, the retirement board meets earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| And I think it actually goes from 10.00 until noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| So the chairman may not be able to make it to the chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| You know, if we, I mean, there will be four of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| I mean, it depends on where you decide, you know, what you decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I thought that the pension board met at 9.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| No, it's at 10.00, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| In fact, I thought we had pushed back our lunch based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| What about it, Ed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| It's at 10.00, but we had an extraordinarily long meeting, your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| Didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Generally, it's about an hour, not over an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I think we might be there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| We can adjust these times, because, yeah, I would definitely like to be at the lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| You know, one of the things that I guess that I found out about the pension board is that there's a lot of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| Probably we get sued more there than everywhere else combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| And that's the only reason, you know, I mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| I don't think it's entirely predictable how long the pension board is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| But I just bring that up as an issue, because there may be three or four of us, you know, late getting to the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| I think we could generally expect to be out in an hour and a half, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| Well, that would get us there at 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| And I could even move it to 11.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Again, I'm just throwing some things out for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| This may not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Well, I think 11.30 would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| I think that would be fine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| And there's a pension meeting tomorrow at 9.30 if anybody's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| Also, again, on the public forum, we would still have our public forum at 5.45 or 6 o'clock or whenever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| But this public forum at 1.45 would be for non-agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| So if someone just wanted to speak to us about whatever, they can always speak to us during the meeting about an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| So we're saying that the lunch is going to start at 11.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| And we'll just cut into the break, 15-minute break and start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Or we'll just stop at 12.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| I think last time everybody kind of liked to have that additional time to meet with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| and get ready for the meeting at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| Second thing, you had discussed Julie and Drew about their schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3153)|
| 0:52:41| Does the same apply for UK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I think he kind of falls under our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| I have not met with UK yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| That's going to be one of my next things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Plus, we also have employees with the internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| I will say, too, that we talked with Julie and Drew about what happens if flu is ravishing the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| and they're both out sick and there's nobody there to answer the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| and we're working on a backup plan in case both of them are out of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| so we always have somebody there to man the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| But, no, I like that thought and that structure and that discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| I like for it, you know, I'm not saying it's not been extended, but just that accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Mr. Chairman, if there's flu, I think it's the newest commissioner that's supposed to man the phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| So you need to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| I don't like that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| But just so you know, I do have, I'm going to be setting up meetings with the internal audit folks and with UK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| Those are our employees just so that they can ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| and we can start having some accountability and structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| And you all please let me know if there's anything that you think that we need to be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Now, do we have a couple more items that we need to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| Any questions about any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| This is a resolution that was added for a grant for juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| We don't have a resolution on this, so we'll send it out with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Do we have another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| That was a resolution to approve a grant for a golf cart with Patricia Neal paying part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| We do not have a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| And that was with Ms. Blasius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I'd like to move that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| We'll send that on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| We don't have a resolution number for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Mr. Troyer, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Mr. Troyer, I know he addressed it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Are there any other further questions before we take formal action on the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Mr. Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Commissioner Anders, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| I'm with the Rules Committee on bringing this up to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Does anybody that's on the Rules Committee have a problem with meeting a few minutes, 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| before the next commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| You're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| I'll send the notice out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Does anybody have any questions for Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| There's no severance packages in here, are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| We don't want to be here another hour now, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| I'm just kidding, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| If you've got a question, we'll be happy to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Greg McKay said he had 200 people coming in here after a while for a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| On line item transfers, do I hear a motion that we approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| I'm going to put them on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Is there all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| I know that you all will probably shed a tear, but I will not be here Monday for the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| Vice Chair Anders will be in charge of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| I will be in the country of Cuba, and I hope I get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| I won't say that in the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Yes, Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| I would like to ask the mayor to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| I have a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Mayor Burchett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Well, Mayor Burchett, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Isn't travel to Cuba illegal for U.S. citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Unless you have a special visa, and I have a special visa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| You're one to give in for the ethics committee, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Is there a country music, burgeoning country music industry down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| Sir, I'm Tim Burchett, county mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Yeah, Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| I won't take much time because I know everybody is ready to get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| I'm a little concerned about the 10-year plan that's going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| And one thing that's concerning me is the alcohol policy the 10-year plan currently has in place to allow alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3378)|
| 0:56:27| I just want to know your viewpoints and what your stance is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Was that the end of your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Did I cut you off, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| You want to know what my opinion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| What the current policy is of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Apparently, it's my opinion that if they do allow alcohol in these, that is a deal breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| I think that's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| I've talked to several folks involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I've actually talked to some friends who've been through, I guess, what's technically called the 12-step method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| Currently, I guess it's just a lifelong deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| And they agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| They think that that is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| But I think what we might ought to do is ask some of the people in town who do provide those type of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3429)|
| 0:57:18| And there are several just in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| And ask them and get their written opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| Because I think that we are going down a slippery slope with that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| I appreciate you asking me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| But as far as I'm concerned, it knocks county's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| That is a deal breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Well, I guess I'm just trying to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| Is there something written that says alcohol is allowed in the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| I mean, and if it is, we need to have that presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Because what I don't want are statements that go out there like they're true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| and someone's read and nuanced and curved it around and got that to be a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| So let's ‑‑ I hate for things to come up impromptu like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| This is not the way to legislate openly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| This wasn't on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| And I really think we need to not talk about this until we're ready to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| I need documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| If we don't have documents, we don't need to discuss that, and we're out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| You can consider this documented if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| But Jenny Weatherstone was at a meeting over at the South Knox Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| and said that this was their policy, that they do currently do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| They cannot have it in the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| It has to be in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| It has nothing to do with the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| I'm going to agree with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| I mean, if we want to discuss this, I think it would be appropriate to put it on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| and let's have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| But I'm going to rule with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| I'm going to let the business come before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101018?start=3538)|
