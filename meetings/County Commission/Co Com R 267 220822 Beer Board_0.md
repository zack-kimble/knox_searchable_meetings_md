| 0:07:30| The way this procedure will work is Lieutenant Lawson from the Sheriff's Department will state the allegation against you and your business for selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=450)|
| 0:07:41| You will then have a chance to either admit or deny that allegation, and you or your attorney have every right to talk to and say what you want to this board before a decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=461)|

| 0:07:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Okay, Lieutenant Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| On July 18, 2022, at approximately 1935 hours, an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office entered Don Gallo's restaurant on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=477)|
| 0:08:08| It's 10681 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| They ordered a draft beer from the bartender, presented their ID, and were sold the alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| Okay, do you understand the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=503)|

| 0:08:45| Ms. Macedo, I think you've just admitted that Don Gallo did, in fact, serve an alcoholic beverage to an underage minor or who you thought or the server thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Can you just tell us a little bit about the person that did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| The bartender was working with us for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| We hired him, and particular that day he was not using his glasses, so he asked for the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| He was not able to see correctly the ID, and he was not able to see it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| He was saying that he was blurry vision that day, so he was thinking that he was in the right age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| And what steps were taken after you discovered that this had happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| We let him go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| We hired a new person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| We let him go the next day because we were not able to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| He was just working with us for two weeks, and he's not anymore there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| And is your restaurant part of the Responsible Vendors Program where you require people to get ABC licenses, things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| I think that's all that we have to present, but certainly there are mitigating circumstances in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| and the establishment has clearly taken steps to rectify the situation by letting that person go and installing a new bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| May I ask just one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Could we get your name and address as well since you're representing the license holder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Oh, I am so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| I should have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=612)|

| 0:10:27| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| That should have been the first words out of my mouth, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| One final question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| I understand the mitigating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Has the Knox County Sheriff been back to visit this restaurant on a similar kind of operation, and do you know what the result was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| Yeah, they came, I think, two weeks ago, a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| We have a visit again, and we had a new bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| The new bartender was following all the policies, and we passed the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| We were told we did a good time, we did a good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And are you asking this commission to give you leniency with regards to the permit for that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| Ma'am, if you could please begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I'm so sorry, but we need a recording for the clerk's record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Are you asking this beer board to give you and your restaurant leniency for this occasion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| This is in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| The chair will look for a motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Lieutenant Lawson, at this particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| has the Tennessee Department of Alcohol Beverage Control done a sting at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| and did they pass or fail that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| To my knowledge, they have not done one recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| This is the third time they violated in the year and a half that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| that I have been running the alcohol compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| The first time they appeared before the board, we had purchased a margarita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| and there was some confusion as to whether or not you all held the ability to fine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| But after speaking to TABC, they purchase beer when they do underage alcohol buys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| So the type of alcohol doesn't really matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| The fact of the matter is they sold alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| So this is the third time they violated with the sheriff's office in a year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| even though it only shows second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| because they weren't technically fined by the board for their first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| But it's still classified as a third offense then, even though we took no action on the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| I'm not sure how it's classified with the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| whether you take offense or charge for an offense or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| but it's the third offense in a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| Okay, and the time between the second offense and the third offense was approximately 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| On this paper, it was approximately, from when we purchased the original margarita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| it was approximately a year and two months until the technical first offense on this page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| and then the next month we got the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Okay, so within 30 days they had two offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Well, I guess my question is to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| if technically they have three offenses, is that three offenses that we would recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=800)|
| 0:13:32| I would ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| I don't think so, because we passed on that first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| because unfortunately it was a margarita rather than a beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| but it did go to the state, and they did some sort of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| But we have since changed our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Just recently this body changed the ordinance whereby a violation of the state alcohol law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| by selling any alcohol would constitute an offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| but since that just recently changed, I think we're bound by the two offenses that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| that Lieutenant Lawson has referenced, even though, you know, in reality it's a third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| but I think all you can go by right now is the two offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you, Director Vuk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| I'll look to a motion for action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| Have you had, in the last 14 months, have you had change in management at Don Gallo's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=869)|
| 0:14:38| I know you were closed for a few months for your remodel, and it's beautiful now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Has there been any changes in your upper management structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| No, the management structure, but we haven't had a lot of changes of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| because they come in and then two days later they don't show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| so we have a lot of new people, new servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| And especially after the remodelation, we really were struggling hiring bartenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| So the last one, his name is Hector, and he's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| I mean, he's the person who was able to handle very good the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| How long were you closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| We closed four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It was supposed to be for two weeks, and after all the permits and everything, it was four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| So it was really hard for us to be closed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Oh, Ms. Macedo, this makes me sick, because I know you are a wonderful restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| I know that you have a family environment even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| You understand that we are bound by law in our penalties that are dished out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=950)|
| 0:15:59| We have very little flexibility in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Is that correct, law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| You're bound by the law, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Given this is actually a second offense that we recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| and you do, I'm sure, understand you are on the hen's eyes if this were to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=974)|
| 0:16:24| I don't have the new fines in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| I believe it's $1,500 for the second offense or 90 days of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| So your choices are $1,500 fine or a 60-day suspension of your beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| Do you have a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1005)|
| 0:17:01| Yes, I will pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| We'll make a motion then that we accept the guilty plea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| and administer a fine of $1,500 for this second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| Motion by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1038)|

| 0:17:30| That fine is administered, and the clerk will be in touch with you to settle the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1050)|

| 0:18:19| Director Booth, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| The procedure will be, you've seen what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| but Lieutenant Lawson will give a statement of the allegation against you for underage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| You will then have a chance to either admit or deny the allegation he makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1110)|

| 0:18:43| Lieutenant Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| On July 18, 2022, approximately 2,200 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| entered the business at 2064 Kosteak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1132)|

| 0:19:05| We admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Is there anything you'd like to address the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| We termed the employee immediately, and any fines or stripping of Lawson's is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1150)|
| 0:19:22| Back to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1162)|

| 0:19:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| You're located in District 6, which is the district I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| Again, as I said to the prior people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| you do understand that we have little flexibility in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| Director Booth, the new fines that we have made are retroactive as far as numbers of offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1198)|
| 0:20:12| Is that correct from the changes that we made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| No, no, that was just on that one because it was a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| And right now it looks like these are three beer offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| and so this should be treated as a third offense if the others were beer offenses rather than liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1225)|
| 0:20:34| I'd like to yield to Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| The beer permit was originally issued then on March 31st of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| They had their first violation 16 days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| Then they went about a year and a month for their next violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| and then they went approximately 45 days for their next violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1262)|
| 0:21:14| To me that's pretty serious that when you're selling beer to minors in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1274)|
| 0:21:23| and it's not a right to sell beer in Knox County, it's a privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| And this body does have the option when they dish out the third offense fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| to just do a surrendering the beer permit for X number of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1295)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| I'd like to request some more guidance from Director Boog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| Guidance is at your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| As far as the surrender as opposed to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| You have that discretion within your body to do that under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1326)|
| 0:22:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| Like you said, you can do 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Third offense is pretty serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1344)|

| 0:22:42| It is very difficult to find employees that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| But we are willing and understand that it's a serious violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1367)|

| 0:23:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1437)|

| 0:24:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| It has to be locked up and not accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| So if you take butcher's paper and just cover your coolers or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| and run a chain through it, that will suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1446)|

| 0:25:12| Do you admit or deny the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| We admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1515)|

| 0:25:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| The cashier in question was terminated immediately on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| and I will tell you we agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| It is a privilege to be able to sell in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| We do go through extensive training from the POS systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Then they go with orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| They go through the task class, ABC class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| You know, we have the system where they enter in the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| and it shows whether the sale can go through or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| And we failed this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| Thank you, Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| The chair will look to the commission for any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1550)|

| 0:26:04| with the 7th District and working with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| But we'll give you a choice of a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| A $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Is there a motion that we accept the $1,000 fine motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| I have a motion by Commissioner Bussler for a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| And a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1584)|

| 0:26:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| The clerk will get with you for the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Is there any further business to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| To refresh my memory, I think Commissioner Smith brought up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| the person selling the beer, what is their punishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| They're issued a noncustodial arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| So we write them a citation and they show up two weeks later to get booked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| and processed and they go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| They come here and get booked on Maine at our criminal processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| It's on the far end of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| They have to hire a lawyer probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Most of those are misdemeanored or held in Sessions Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| so they can just plead guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| I mean, if they want to hire an attorney to fight it, they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| but it's usually not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| It's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| It's going to be probably $200, $225 out of pocket for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| Well, not as much as the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| It was a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Well, the fine itself is probably $50, but they have to pay court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| That's where your money comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| I guess they know that if they get caught doing that, that's their consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| They will be arrested in a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| I think we've only physically arrested one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| That was from the Andrew Johnson location about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| I just didn't know if there was something that could be done to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| I'm not going to use the word help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| I hate to see the good partners like the Weigels and Silas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| They are a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| They're a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Help is hard to get, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| is there some way that we could raise that fine or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| Yeah, that would be up to the courts because it's a state fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| One thing that can – and I know it's been pointed out by this board –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| is buying the electronic readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I know Commissioner Schoonmaker has brought it up a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| That's the easiest way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| There's no digital manipulation to where you can accidentally type in a wrong number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| or misread a birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| You know, those are $500 to $1,500, but, you know, second offense is $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| So it kind of pays for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Metro Drug Coalition, could you join us at the podium for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| Could you – I'm in agreement with Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| and then I'm always wondering what else can we do to educate the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| who need to educate the servers, the cashier registers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| the folks who operate and sell beer no matter where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| What services or what information do you all provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| I think at one point we talked about when somebody got a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| that you all would include some sort of packet with a lot of this information in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Is that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| They get their packet once they get their beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| but that's the only time that they get their packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Ma'am, could you state your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Oh, Courtney Niemann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| So can you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| They get a packet when they get their beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| but that's the only time that they get a packet from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| And it does include – look, if you are caught serving underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| you're going to end up with a misdemeanor and booked into court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I'm trying to figure it out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| I mean, I don't think we can mandate people buy a piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| I don't think that's in our purview to require companies to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Obviously, we've upped our fines, so hopefully that sends a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Perhaps we can work with the Metro Drug Coalition on a campaign that says the fines have been up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| the sheriff's department is out, re-educate your team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| and let's cut down on underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Maybe there's a way that the commission can just partner with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| and I'll leave that in your court to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| We would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Commissioner Schoenbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| The state of Tennessee has tried to make it as idiot-proof as possible for the servers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| and bartenders and retail cashiers as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| If somebody walks in and hands them their driver's license, it's going to look just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Everyone in this room today has a driver's license that looks just like this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| If you're under 21, it's like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| So any bartender, any retail clerk, anyone, a server, when they ask for an ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| and it shows it like this, they just hand it right back to them and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| no, thank you, we cannot serve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| The state's made it as simple for our retail establishments as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| And there's even a red line across the licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Well, if you can't realize what's rectangular up or this way, just look for the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| But Commissioner Schoenbeck, is this based upon what you're seeing out there in the violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| Are they literally looking at a vertical license and typing it wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| They're putting in what they want to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Whether or not they read the date or look at the license at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| I see, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| They're just typing in the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Just to move on with the sale or it could be for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| I mean, it could be for a nefarious reason, but it could be just you've got a long list of customers, move on, get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| One of our underage persons is 17 and looks like she's about 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| So there's no reason in this world that they wouldn't double look at that ID and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| but they've been selling to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| We're not trying to put in a 20-year-old that's 20 and 364 days and looks like he's 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| We make it pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Lieutenant Officer, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| We record these people that are charged with a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Does that record continue on if they're hit again and it's the same person at another location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1980)|
| 0:33:08| Does that pop up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| So I can see where they've been arrested as long as it's locally in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| I can still see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| If they have it expunged and they go through the full expungement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| sometimes it will wipe it out of our gym system, sometimes it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| It just depends on what steps their attorney takes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| But I think the gentleman at the Castaic Lane, and I'm not trying to single them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| I believe it was his second offense at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| Okay, but what I'm getting at here is, okay, if for some reason they get fired at this one location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| and they go to another location and they pull their record up as they're hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| would they see that on their record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Again, it depends on what their attorney has done as far as an expungement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| How long does it take to get an expungement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| How easy is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| So usually they're given judicial diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| So if they're good for 11 months and 29 days, they can go off their record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| So for 11 months and 29 days, it's guaranteed to show on a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| None of that's submitted to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| But if you get one that has the second offense at a different location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| is there any difference in fines or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So General Nichols, who works for the Sheriff's Office now, and I have had this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| we ran into that because the courts were dismissing the cases with a fine only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| And I have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| You know, give them the diversion, make them burn their diversion, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Don't dismiss the case on fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| So we had an e-mail conversation with ADA Joubran, Samia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2092)|
| 0:35:02| and she said she's going to look at these more closely to make sure they're not being dismissed on face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| They're actually going to try to look at it and do something with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| So hopefully in the future, if somebody builds a record into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| they'll automatically be shown up, but will that be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| if somebody's hiring, will they be able to see those records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| As long as it stays on the record and they don't have it expunged, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| But an expungement, everybody pretty much gets one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| So when you go to the second, you've got a certain, a more extensive, and then third is more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| Third, hopefully they get a day or two in jail at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| That's what we're looking at. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Lieutenant Lawson, this is my last beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for all the hard work you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| and for over the years all the good you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| You've taken this program and put a lot of teeth into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| Looking at the last report, I think we had two of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| I think we see the violations here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| but we don't see the good that it's doing out there with how many people are getting the message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| and I attribute that a lot to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| I appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Also, we have former Chairman and Commissioner Hugh Nystrom in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| Is he here for a beer violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-beer-board?start=2192)|
