| 0:22:57| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Is this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Do we have Ray Isik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Mr. Did I say that right, Isik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Isaac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Isaac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| All right, if you'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Ray Isaac, 9858 Footpath Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I'm speaking on behalf of most of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| We had a meeting this week at one of the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| and we opposed this project for three serious issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| The first one, the whole subdivision is zoned for single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| and the proposal here for 68 unit violate that zoning from single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| to townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| In addition, the current CCNR state that it is single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| So this project, as it is, violate that CCNR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| And we are puzzled why the homeowners, the HOA company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| the transfer did not take an action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and we are working to transfer the HOA to the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| So the other thing that lacks, there is no current traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| The old traffic study was in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| If any of you are familiar with Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Pellissippi is a disaster area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| So much traffic, so many cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| sometime when you leave in the morning or the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| you have to really fight your way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| So we need an updated traffic study to show the current changes from 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| In addition, the environmental study has not been done also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| So I ask you, all your commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| how would you like to go buy a house in a subdivision zoned for single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| everybody buys it as single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| and suddenly, after three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| you find out somebody wants to build 68 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Can you imagine every townhome will be two, three cars coming out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| The exit, the entrance and exit to this development will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| in a very small area between two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| The street in Ridge Climber is really smaller than the typical street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| If two cars are parked together, nobody else can come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| And many times that happens, we have to call one of the houses to move their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| So the main issue here, we appreciate the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| when he proposed the single family to start with way back four or five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| but to come in the middle, like in the middle of the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| change the rules and change it from single family to townhome, that did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| If the townhome and the single family was planned ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| before we purchased the home, we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| But everybody in the subdivision are puzzled and outraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| like after four or five years, somebody comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| and put townhome inside a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| I would like to ask any of you, how would you like to go purchase a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| in a subdivision, a single family, and then four or five years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| you found out the townhome will be in the middle of the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| Thank you, Mr. Isaac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| All right, let's see here. Do we have Heath Gim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| I think that is remote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| He's not on? Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Okay, would the applicant like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| John Richard Patterson, Kimley Horner Associates, 4031 Aspen Grove, Franklin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| First, I'd like to start with thanking staff for working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| to bring this concept back to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| So Westland Oaks Unit 3 was a 68-unit concept plan that was previously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| with townhomes back in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| That expired in 2023, so we are now just here to redo that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1663)|
| 0:27:52| But this time we're coming with more efficient townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| in the sense that they are smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| so the disturbance of the property is much less than what it was previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| And then also because of that, we're able to add off-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| so that allows additional parking stalls for each home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| I think it comes out to roughly three spaces per home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| so that would help with parking on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| And then to somewhat address the residents' concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| we've had environmental scientists out on the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| to do studies of wetlands and streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| They've reported their findings to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| We've accounted for those in our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| We've submitted them to TDEC for review and concurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| And then as far as the covenants and restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| our research has not led us to be aware that we are part of that being Phase 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| And then to address the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| the traffic study was done for all three phases back in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| and is still relevant for the unit count that is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| And we have accepted the condition of working with engineering staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| to implement the westbound left-turn lane from Westland on to Ridge Climber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| which would help with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So thank you all for your consideration and happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Just for the record, Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| because of the opposition's question about trafficking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| that was done back around the COVID period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| I'm assuming that you guys would re-look at that traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| and make any modifications if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| We would, Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| As part of the MOU process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| where we would consult with another civil engineer to make those improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| we would look at the potential updated traffic counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| and make sure that whatever length of left-turn lane that was installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| was appropriate based on the trips that would be generated from the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Mr. Chair, if it's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I would like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| subject to the seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| We have a motion to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| subject to the seven noted conditions by Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Oh, have we got lights somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Commissioner Adams. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| My question is, I guess, to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| Because of the comment that the opposition stated of the HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| and saying that there is to be single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| and then the applicant saying they don't believe that in their research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| that they are part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| It's obviously connected to the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| so how did that issue get vetted through staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| We wouldn't have vetted that particular issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| if it's related to their HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Is that what you're asking is whether or not we would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Well, my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| if there is some kind of tenant with the HOA that says all of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| supposed to be one building type and that there's some discrepancy there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1878)|
| 0:31:28| at what juncture is that being addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| We are not addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| We're looking at the zoning and what the zoning allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| and so the zoning does allow consideration for this type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So going into an academic realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| I just don't have the history on all of that in my brain at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| but the entire area was under the same zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| or just that new portion that we're discussing changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Let me take a look real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| It looks like it was all PR up to three dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| Is that something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| So that hasn't changed, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| unless staff correct me if I'm wrong here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| but the zoning has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| The entirety of the site was PR up to three dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| and there's no conditions that I'm aware of that would restrict it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| single-family residential, like single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| So I'm going to bounce to council just to ask about understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| our purview is the zoning, and that's where we're making our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Just thinking about community and how they handle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| what juncture should that have been addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| That's exactly right, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| This body is going to be looking at land use decisions, zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| If there are, in fact, issues that relate to the HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| or some types of covenants or restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| that would be something that would be more appropriately addressed by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| court, and the homeowners and the folks in that community would have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| ability to address that in a different setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| So in my view, that's not something that you all would need to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| or consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Right now you're looking at land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| There are other forums that are more appropriate for that type of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| So we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| And I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2020)|

| 0:33:45| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| We approve the development plan for up to 68 attached dwellings on one lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2026)|

| 0:34:02| seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2042)|

| 0:34:15| Agenda item 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| Applicant, Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Location, north side of Lyons Bend Road, east of South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| Approximate size of tract, 15.07 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Present plan and zoning designation is low density residential, water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| public parks, hillside protection, stream protection, RN1, flood plain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| overlay, and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Proposed plan designation, medium density residential, water, hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| protection, and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land, water, and rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Staff recommendation on the sector plan is to deny the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| residential land use classification because it is inconsistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| criteria for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| The water, hillside protection, and stream protection areas would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2113)|
| 0:35:22| Motion two, regarding the one-year plan, is to deny the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| amendment to the MDR land use classification because it's inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| with the criteria for a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Water, hillside, and stream protection areas would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| And then finally, motion three, on the rezoning, deny RN3 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| because it is incompatible with surrounding conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Flood plain overlay and hillside protection overlay districts would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| The applicant is standing before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Okay, we have opposition, and bear with me just a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2157)|
| 0:36:08| Okay, we have Mr. Richard Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| First of all, let me ask a counselor here, would you like to proceed or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I'll defer, please, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Mr. Duncan, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| There's two of us, Mike Wink, and we both asked to speak, and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| Duncan's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| If you'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Good afternoon, my name is Mike Wink, and my address is 1004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Kensington Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2195)|

| 0:36:40| We're both retired federal prosecutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| We live two houses from the applicant on Linesman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| I want to address what's in the West Sector Plan, and I want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| about some of the development policies which you are to consider in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| deciding this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| At page 38 of the case file, or excuse me, of this West Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| at 7.2, it says protect water resource by reducing pollution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| retaining trees and ground cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| And the applicant has stated that he decided that he's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| live there anymore because of the development at Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| because a bunch of ball fields were constructed closer to his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| property, and some lights have been put in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| And he is on the lake, as you can see in that, or this is actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| cove, and if you look at the first map on your case file, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2262)|
| 0:37:52| found at page 38, I believe, or excuse me, 15, which was prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| it shows the floodplain and it shows the slopes around his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| Most of his property is in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| And so to pass his rezoning request, you're not protecting the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| resources by reducing pollution, when he made the decision not to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| there anymore, he tore his house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| You can see that if you go to Google Maps, Ariel, you'll see his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| property with his house torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Below his house is a basketball court covered, and below that, trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| That's where property from the hillside and from our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| drains underlines been on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Those trees filtered the water before going into the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Those trees have since been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| And so his actions after he tore down his house is already in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| violation of the 7.2 consideration of protecting the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| 7.5, protect natural drainage systems associated with floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| and floodplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Again, his actions have already violated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Silt is running into the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Restrict development on slopes, this is 7.6, greater than 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| along streams and rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| He's along a stream, a cove, and if you look at the map found at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| page 15, which is prepared, it's titled Staff Slope Analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| most of his property has a greater than 15% line along the shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| around his house and on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Quite a bit of the property, and that's it right there, quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| of the property is in pink and purple, and that pink is 15% to 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| sloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| The red is greater than 25% sloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| And so the property does not lend itself to development along those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Going to section 9.3, ensure that the content of new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| including scale and compatibility does not impact existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| neighborhoods and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| We've talked about that in my comment and a follow-up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| applicant's attorney's comment, but I want to add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| Section 10.9 says avoid creating zone boundaries that result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| unlike uses directly facing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2420)|

| 0:40:27| When he leaves his property, he's facing our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| And as I've said in the last comment, his property is intimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| attached to our subdivision both by sound and visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| And so when we leave our subdivision, and this is the main entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and exit on Lyons Bend Road, we're facing what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| Section 9.5 says avoid locating residences or other noise-sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| land uses that will be subject to excessive noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| That's the reason he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| It says avoid locating residences that will be subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| excessive noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| The noise, the construction over at Lakeshore Park is enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| cause him to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| And now he wants to put a whole bunch of people in a medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| density residency zoning situation exposed to that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| And the staff has already pointed out, I believe, that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| I want to focus real quickly before concluding on what you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| to consider for medium density residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| There are three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| As a transitional area between commercial development and low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| density residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| We're in a low density residence area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| He is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| If this is converted to medium density residence, there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| transition to any commercial property nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| When you exit Lines Bend Road onto North Shore Drive, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| to go two miles west before you get to Rocky Hill, a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| If you exit right, you have to go one mile before you get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Kingston Pike, a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| This is not a transition area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Mr. Wink, if you could wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| I'll just wrap up with that and ask respectfully for some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| for Mr. Duncan to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| My name is Richard Duncan, 1009 Kensington Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| Mr. Duncan, I'll give you, sorry to interrupt here, I'll give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| 1009 Kensington Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| I lived there with my wife for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| I'm a retired attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| She is a retired owner of Greenway School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| The traffic is designated as E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| It's only gotten worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| It's gotten quite bad in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| My wife and I developed the Richmond Orchard Tiny Houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| We followed all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| We were only developing 11 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| And we worked with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| And we also were advised by the staff to meet with our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| We have not had such a meeting with Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| probably for obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| It tells me what I need to know about what kind of development this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| be and what kind of neighbor that we could expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| This is totally inappropriate for the peninsula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| which is entirely single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| with the exception of the Peninsula Club, Westminster Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| They meet none of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| And the question is, are we going to follow the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| or is this community going to follow the path followed by Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| and Atlanta?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| And we can see what happens when you don't plan and when you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Is Ms. Ashley Williams here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Ashley Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| He had intended to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| I just got an email that he had a medical issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| and I think he's being transported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Hope he's well, gets well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| Councilor Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I wanted to briefly address a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| This was postponed from last week in part because Mr. Smith was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| to talk to Mr. Williams and try to get something set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| and they weren't able to get a neighborhood meeting set up with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Williams trying to coordinate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| But it was postponed in part to be able to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| This property is pretty unique in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| It is really kind of isolated in and of itself as far as where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Across North Shore Drive, there is RN-5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| It is across from Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| And then you get into the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| and you have those older subdivisions that are still zoned in the A zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| But then you also have industrial zoning there across the cove as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| which is a KUB facility, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| So it's really kind of its own isolated residential node at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| And they didn't mention in the neighborhood comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| but even in the petition that was signed, they keep talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| could be 72 townhomes, and that's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| It could not be done if we wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| The density is a function in the city of the dimensional design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| and other environmental constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| And they've talked a lot about the environmental constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| If you were to take the five acres that are above the summer pool line, 813,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| and then you apply it without considering anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| that number comes to 72 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| But that is assuming, and Mr. Frey actually outlined all the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| considerations during the agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| that's assuming you can build within the 60-foot riparian buffer zone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| that 813, which requires special permission from city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| It's assuming you could actually build within the flowage easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| that's the 822 contour line, which requires a TVA approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| and a no-rise study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| And if you've ever been involved in a no-rise study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| you know that's kind of difficult to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| And also within the floodplain with the city, you know, you can do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| but you have to elevate it to one foot above the 500-foot plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Then you're not even considering the property that you'll have to back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| within that consideration for internal infrastructure, stormwater detainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| the driveways, the parking areas, the buffer zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| All of that, the slope protection areas as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| all of that would have to be backed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| So you're really looking at a very small envelope that could actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| developed into anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| And this isn't maybe at best one or two acres could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| So this isn't really an issue of 72 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| It's an issue of the type of housing that the zoning would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| And being this close to an amenity like the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| this would be a nice location for a small kind of pocket townhome development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| that would want to be close to the amenities that are across the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| Instead of being a 10-, 20-, 30-minute drive from Lake Shore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| it would be a one- to two-minute drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| It would be wonderful if we could work something out with KUB to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| convenient access across the bridge because it does connect to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| greenway system, but that's not something that's available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| So it's really about housing type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| And the housing type, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| townhome development is similar in size and scale and scope to single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| residential except they're attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| The concerns that the neighbors raised about runoff and the environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| constraints, that's going to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And traffic, that's going to be a concern with any type of development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| goes into this location, whether it's single-family residential or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| As far as density, I think there was a comment we should only do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| We don't really set density in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| But with the RN Zone, with single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| the density technically could allow 4.3 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| even the RN One Zone for single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| So we're really looking at trying to do a respectful townhome development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| would take advantage of those amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Now, Mr. Smith did live there and he did remove his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| I think he took down a couple of dead trees that were in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| It's not like he just clear-cut everything when he did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| And, you know, he did have some concerns about the ball fields moving closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2945)|
| 0:49:13| and the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| He attended all the meetings when Lake Shore was talking about improving and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| re-orienting many of the amenities they offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| And, you know, we looked at the lighting plans and how they were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| direct it away from his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| But he decided, well, you know, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| I don't have any small kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| I would rather look at this maybe as something that I could develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| and I could live somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| You know, and that's certainly his prerogative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| but that doesn't mean now it's because of his subjective decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| it's unfit for any type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| In fact, there's, I think, a very big market for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| kind of a smaller mid-form housing in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| which speaks to the changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| I mean, we know the population increase is a changing condition in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| We know that the need for diversity of housing stock and middle-form housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| is something that the city has been trying to find ways to encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| and that is a changing condition in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| And just being this close to the amenities of Lake Shore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| and the reinvestment they recently did in the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| in improving the amenities of Lake Shore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| that is also a changing condition in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| I think Lake Shore is a crown jewel park for both the city and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| and there would be a substantial market for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| that would like to live close to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| So, you know, it is a challenging site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| By changing the zoning, you don't affect the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| you don't affect the water pollution, you don't affect the traffic one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| All it does is give us an opportunity to design something that would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| And townhome developments in the RN3 is a special use application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| which means it would come back to planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| it would come back to city engineering, it would come back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| to review and consider all of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| And there would be opportunities at that time to study the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| to study potential environmental issues, and through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| follow the rules and see if it could be corrected or mitigated in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| So, with all of that, I respectfully ask that you consider the changing conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| and would approve the sector plan amendment to MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| which is consistent with the RN5 that's just right across North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| from this property, and also approve the zoning to RN3 to allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| to really put some thought into a respectful townhome development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3099)|
| 0:51:49| Commissioner Huber, I'm still not used to these little lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| I think Commissioner Schell's light was on before mine, and I'll let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| All right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| So this one, I think, I've kind of gone back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| Lakeshore Park being right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| I think it can make sense to allow some higher density near parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| I think that's generally a goal of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| So I'm very interested to hear what the rest of the commissioners think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| because I'm very on the fence, because I also don't think that RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| the housing types that are allowed within RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| are out of character next to single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| Townhomes as a special use being the most intense is not that extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| I do wish that city council would have approved RN3 as allowed within LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| because then we wouldn't need a one-year plan or sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| But I also sort of wonder, perhaps if others are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| the applicant could respond on why the entire property is being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| If only a portion of it is potentially going to be usable and buildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| in my mind it could make sense to just rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| or it would make sense theoretically to rezone part of it as sort of a gesture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| of, you know, this is somewhat of a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Would the applicant care to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| You know, I hadn't been asked or considered that question before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Commissioner Schelso, so you kind of put me on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| I think with all of the development considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| and environmental considerations for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| it really sticks one way, half does another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| It doesn't really make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| You can only do so much once you start to do the design aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| And so trying to project and draw that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| not knowing whether you can do it and all the engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| you're kind of feeling around in the dark on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| I do appreciate it would be a gesture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| but you would really have to do some architectural and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| to figure out what you could or couldn't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| and where that appropriate line may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| But the good thing is it's going to come back to this body for review regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Yeah, and thank you, Councillor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I think that the fact that it is, you know, on the water, within floodways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| you know, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| that's kind of really the hesitation of me to rezone the entire property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| given the sensitive area kind of ecologically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| So those are kind of my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| And like I said, I'm interested to hear what other commissioners have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Yeah, and I have some of the same feelings in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| and certainly respectfully with Mr. Wink and Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| It is a different housing type that they're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| but I'm like Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| I don't really feel like it's a stretch to go to something attached versus detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| I mean, you've got some nice large lots in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| But one thing I did notice in our new growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| actually has the entire subdivision over in Westminster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| and in that area as the urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| which I think that speaks a little bit to versus planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| I think with the right road infrastructure, that is the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| or they would like to encourage higher density in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| That, along with, you know, as I'm looking at the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| the current plan and with the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| you've actually got Westchase 300 feet away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| which is a multifamily condo type development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| similar probably to what Mr. Smith is looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| And I'm familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| I mean, it's a nice looking complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Speaking to, I think, you know, the question about can you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| zone part of it or not part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| I think that's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| And Joshua at the city might be able to speak to it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| But if it's in that floodway, even if it is zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| if it does get down into that flood, you can't use it for density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| You can't use it for, you know, for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| So I think that kind of takes care of itself right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| I, too, think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| the proximity to the park area over there is a nice thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| It's a nice draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| County engineering, do you guys, Steve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| do you know what classification North Shore is in that area by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| Is it in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Is it a major arterial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I think it would be a major arterial, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| And I would think, I mean, granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I know there are some issues with that intersection, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| that a lot of people have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| and it has changed a lot in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| But very close into the city, very close to the city core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| I think I would be in support of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| To answer Commissioner Schelso's desire to hear what other people are thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| I have also struggled with this one for the reasons that have already been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| but I take in the whole it's troubling to me that for someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| previously lived in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| that there hasn't been any kind of real productive dialogue between the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| owner and the neighbors that are going to be living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| That seems odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And the flood waste issue as well is troubling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| It's going to be a smaller parcel, so why, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| if there's truly just going to be a small portion developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| then why are we looking at everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| It seems like it's kind of keeping the door open to do more than maybe we know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| But for me, the real issue is the traffic over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| I mean, it is bad, and it's bad now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| And even if there was a small development of townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| or single family whatever going in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| I just don't feel good about doing that to that particular intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| It's not planned to be signaled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| even though it's been designated as a great opportunity for signaling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| So I just don't feel good about putting more pressure on a spot that's already overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| So for that reason, I don't think staff got it right and support their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| When I first saw this, I had some hesitation seeing the floodways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| seeing the waterway right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| But looking at it more in depth, looking at the context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| one point that came up during agenda review is the natural limitations with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| where they could not develop past a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| I know from experience that in designing in sites like this that are complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| the parking is going to be a big controlling factor in how many units you can even get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3557)|
| 0:59:24| and then also the number of units, just the sizes of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| especially in townhouses where they have to each have their own footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| Point being, a lot of this is unusable, and to the Councillor's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| they won't really know until they know what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| They won't be able to lay it out and see what is usable and what they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| But there's a lot of things in place to protect that area and limit what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| And on top of that, the special use coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| Comments about the ballparks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| I think, if anything, this would serve as a buffer to the neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| You can't control whether the property across the street stays one thing or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| unless you own it, and I think that isn't really, in my mind, much of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3617)|
| 1:00:27| We can't really take that too much into consideration because this could be vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| with no trees, no buffer, so I think that doesn't really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| I don't see that argument against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| I agree that being next to the park, this is an ideal location for townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| Councillor mentioned the drive distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I hope that it would be the walking distance, as you also mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| But it is a very short distance, and I think people with families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| people who want to live somewhere where they can walk around, go and play, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| this is a good location for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| For traffic and infrastructure, it's at the intersection of a major arterial and a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3670)|
| 1:01:19| Those are both...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Whether or not those roads are built out to that, that's what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| And I don't think that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| If you zoom out and look further down Lions Bend, there's a lot of very large parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| that someone may decide, hey, let's take one of these and turn it into a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| with the same number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| And I think that if that were, let's say, one dwelling unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| you're going to maybe be bringing the same amount of traffic here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| but the attitudes might be different because they're one-acre parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| And I don't think that that's appropriate to bring to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| And frankly, this kind of reminds me of a conversation we had, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| last month or a couple months ago across North Shore right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| with just a few single-family houses going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| And again, the context of the R and 5 across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| So I think there's a number of reasons that this does make a lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| So I can't say that I agree with staff on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| and I would definitely be in favor of approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Let's see here. Okay. Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| This is a question probably for Steve, but in the case file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| there is a no-build improvement and there's one for a traffic light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| where Lions View and North Shore are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| Would something like this trigger an improvement there or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| That right away is in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| so I think it's best we direct that to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Could you repeat that question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Yeah. On page 19 of the case file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| there is a no-build condition on North Shore and Lions Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| and then one page down, there's the recommended improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| for a traffic light at Lions Bend and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| So would a development of this size trigger a traffic light there or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| It would typically not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| One may be needed, but I would say typically a development of this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| is not going to trigger any kind of traffic impact study or improvement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| I'd like to make a motion to approve the medium-density residential land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| classification because it is consistent with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| given that there's medium-density RN-5 within a few hundred feet of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| The water, hillside protection, and stream protection areas would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| We have a motion by Commissioner Huber to approve MDR land classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| We have one no, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| One no, Mr. D'Armand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| I'd like to make a motion to approve the one-year plan amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| medium-density residential land use classification because it is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| with the criteria for a one-year plan amendment, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| given that it is in close proximity to new ball fields that have been newly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| created at the park, across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| as well as the close proximity to other medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| The water, hillside protection, and stream protection areas would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| We have a motion to approve the one-year plan amendment to MDR land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3911)|

| 1:05:19| amendment for the cited reasons that Commissioner Huber gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3925)|

| 1:05:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| We have one no, Mr. D'Armand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| I'd like to make a motion to approve the RN-3 general residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| because it is compatible with surrounding conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| The F floodplain hillside protection districts will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240509?start=3941)|
