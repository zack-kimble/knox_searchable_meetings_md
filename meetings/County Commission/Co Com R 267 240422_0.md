| 0:01:23| audience that should be recognized? I see Mr. McBride and Justin Biggs. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=83)|
| 0:01:33| you. Anyone else out there? And I know the mayor is wandering around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=93)|

| 0:02:07| Thank you, Madam Chair. Before we get started with our devotional, I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| recognize my pastor, Reverend Billy McCool, and his wife. They're here. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| commission presented them with an honorary resolution last year, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| thank you for being here. Our speaker tonight, I am very proud of. I've known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| him all of his life, and he is from First Apostolic Church, Reverend Dr. Anthony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| McCool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=154)|
| 0:02:48| Hold on. Sir, excuse me. I don't think your mic is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=168)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy, for taking care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=198)|
| 0:03:43| Testing. Thank you. Madam Chair and members of the Knox County Commission, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| offer you greetings. Thank you for the opportunity to have this time of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| devotion with you, and special honor and thanks to the 7th District Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Rhonda Lee, for this invitation. I'm honored, as she mentioned, to serve with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| her at First Apostolic Church in Knoxville. A great poet once said that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| had friends in low places. I'm honored to have them in a high place, and I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| fortunate for this, and I give honor tonight to our Mayor, Glenn Jacobs, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| well, and I give honor to each and every one of you all, and also everyone in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| house. Psalms 107.23 states, they that go down to the sea and ships that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| business in great waters. These see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| deep, and I believe this evening that the members of this Commission meeting, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| well as everyone behind me, have determined to set sail in waters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| immeasurable, and truly embody this verse. You're brave and aspire to do business in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| great waters, in deep waters. Your mindset is not one of wading by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| shore in ankle-deep water, hoping for the catch to come to you, not just wishful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| thinking for the betterment and sustainable future of Knox County, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| you've made the commitment to get out into deep waters. You're not content with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| having to get out a microscope to see what you have caught, but you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| deeper the water, the bigger the catch, and the greater the treasure. They that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| go down to the sea and ships that do business in great water, these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep, and you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| voluntarily committed your time to do whatever it takes to protect this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| county, which includes, but certainly is not limited to the following, giving of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| your own time and giving of your own resources, at times undergoing public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| scrutiny, at times missing special occasions with your family and friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| at times fielding phone calls at all hours of the night from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| you've missed meals over the weight and stress that comes with setting sail in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| the deep. You've experienced sleepless nights over intense conversations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| sleepless nights over prosecuting even your own decisions as you strive to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| the best ones possible for the county. Storms on the sea are more severe than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| on land and the waves may crash higher, but our verse says, they that go down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| the sea in ships, these are the ones who see the works of the Lord and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| wonders in the deep. I know today that Knox County has leaders who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| determined to set sail in the deep, and because of this, Knox County will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| continue to see great wonders and will continue to flourish because of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| vision. Sure, the storms of adversity will strike and the waves of heated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| debate will crash into the boat, but let this be proof that you all have set sail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| in the deep. In closing, I offer us this hope in our storms at sea, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| disciples also found themselves in a storm and we do tonight as they did. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| acknowledge and woke up Jesus in their boat because we know when we wake up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| Jesus, he is the one who will bring peace. And I believe this peace that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| starts with you all will be go beyond this meeting and will extend to every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| member of Knox County. Mark 436, a short verse that precedes this passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| has a great deal of importance. It states, and there were also with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| other little ships. When you all have peace, everybody on sea will have peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| When the commission has peace, everybody in Knox County will receive peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Before I pray last night, as I read my four year old daughter, Eleanor, her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| bedtime Bible story, her selection was Queen Esther. And I was once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| reminded of her prophetic word that was called over her for her cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Mordecai told her that she was called for such a time as this. And for each and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| every Knox County leader that is here tonight, I believe the same prophetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| word is over your life as well. For you were called for such a time as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| Let us pray. Mighty God, our father, we come before you humbly asking for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| fresh measure of your grace and favor. Lord Jesus, I pray that your omnipotent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| hand would give clarity of thought and mind to these, our governmental leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| as they conduct the governance of our community. In Corinthians, your word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| mentions the gift of government. And as a particular member of the body of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Christ, give these your servants the gift of government, as well as strength,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| wisdom and knowledge. And please, Lord, prosper their personal health and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| resources with bountiful blessings as they voluntarily give up their time as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| public servants in our community. Lord, we call on you today as the disciples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| as we strive for peace for ourselves, and most importantly, for others of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| County. All these things we ask in your name, Jesus, we pray. Amen. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| and bless. Amen. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I look to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=547)|

| 0:09:17| face our nation's flag and offer the proper salute. I pledge allegiance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=570)|

| 0:14:06| invite Mr. Martin's family, if they're here, to join us at the podium, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| anybody else, guests, that would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=849)|
| 0:14:28| I'm going to read the resolution that the Commission has so graciously passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=868)|
| 0:14:36| for in honor of Mr. Bob Martin, who was a longtime principal at Corrington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| Elementary. I'm going to refer to him as Mr. Martin, okay, in this. That's the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| thing I ever really knew to refer to him as. I didn't go to Corrington Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=886)|

| 0:27:39| That also brings an additional 520 indirect jobs to our community for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| total impact of 960 jobs just on the first phase. So once those 440 jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| come online, we'll have about $30 million in new wages going throughout our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| economy here in Knox County. Next slide, please. So what we are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| from an incentive standpoint is a payment in lieu of tax for a term of 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| years and we have built in various mechanisms to protect the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| investment in this property. So should the company not hit those targets of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| 300 million and 440 jobs, there will be clawbacks that are in place. There is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| also the option that should the county over perform what they said that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| pilot term can extend from 10 years up to 15 years. We have calculated the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| payback period on this initial phase investment of 8.8 years using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| modeling software that the state of Tennessee Economic Development utilizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| And then finally, the property. We're recommending a discount on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| down to $30,000 an acre. The assessed value, or excuse me, the appraised value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| on that property is right at $60,000 an acre. So we feel like this is a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| strong company, a strong package to put in front of this company and I'm really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| looking forward to the time that you guys get to meet this company in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| and welcome them officially to our community. This last slide is an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| of what their campus looks like out in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They bought this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| property several years ago. It was 120 acres. They thought they would never fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| it up. They filled up that 120 acres, which is what led to this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| selection process for this campus here in Knox County. So, and we do have, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| there are any questions on the legal and the actual resolution that we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| I'm going to lean on my friend Mark Mamontoff to help us with that, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| happy to take any questions if you have any at this point. Thank you so much. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| we have any questions, any comments at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| Commissioner Jay. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Lawyer, first off, congratulations on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| the recruitment process. I know it takes a long time to find the right partner. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1802)|
| 0:30:13| have talked about the Midway project forever, and I think every time we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| either had a development in and around or we've had some other conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| about what it might be, the sort of the original tenets with the community, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| original agreements with the community have been brought up about number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| jobs, right, salaries for those jobs, salary ranges, and the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| Do you feel that this project meets the, you know, the spirit of all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| community agreements with an opportunity to, for then some, beyond? I do. I feel, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| feel 100% that this is the, this is the right company at the right time for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| location. Absolutely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| Mr. Mametoff, did you have anything you wanted to add? I have a question for him. All right, thank you. I have a question. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1863)|
| 0:31:15| Schoonmaker. Thank you. Mr. Mametoff, come to the podium, sir. I knew it was a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1875)|
| 0:31:26| that you would have a question. It's great to see you, Mark Mametoff, 1215| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Great Oaks Way. You know, we have a great finance team in Knox County, but you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| the guru in the state of Tennessee on pilots, so my question is, is this a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| deal for Knox County? Appreciate the guru comment. That's gonna be on my team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| stand. The, my experience working on these type of projects statewide is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1910)|
| 0:31:59| amount of tax abatement that we're giving for the magnitude of project, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| wage levels is a favorable result compared to what other counties would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| I would say this is actually a conservative abatement that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| nearly as bad as some that I've seen. The company has been really good to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| with in terms of not pushing the envelope and trying to squeeze every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| last dollar out of the community, and so I feel like we've got good callbacks. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| got good protection. Doug mentioned the reduced land value. Our callbacks apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| to that, too, so that, in other words, that they don't only lose part of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| tax payment, but they would, we would be calling back some of the reduced land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| value. I think that's important. We've built an anti-flipping provision so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| can't, like, do part of the park and say, hey, you know, we're just gonna speculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| on the rest, so we're gonna, we've tried to really button it up to protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| community and the integrity of this corporate campus development that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| think, so I think that based on other transactions I've worked on, this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| this is a fair deal for the county and the citizens of the county compared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| what we're getting in exchange. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| Sure. Thank you. Seeing no other. Commissioner Chag. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| Mr. Lawyer, could you please help us in the community better understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| timeline? If approved tonight, what would the process look like going forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| do the final negotiations to close on the land and ultimately begin to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| some construction and ultimately see some jobs that are, would come to reality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Right. So from here, should the Commission approve this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| there's a couple steps with the Knox County Industrial Development Board that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| would occur later this month and then mid-May. After that, I would fully expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| a formal groundbreaking ceremony, probably sometime this fall. Date hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| hasn't been dialed in yet, but I know the company is, they don't want to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| ceremonial groundbreaking. They want to break ground and get going. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| after that, you know, 18 to 24 months, you could probably see the first couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| buildings completed and hiring starting, you know, back that up a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| before opening of those facilities. And where do you expect the workforce to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| be to support this operation? Where does that come from? Yeah, so one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| in any project of this magnitude, we're always talking about a regional. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| this will definitely be a regional workforce. It's, the company spent time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| and really dug into our talent pipeline. A huge shout out to the folks at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| High School. You know, Carter High School has a welding laboratory that was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| attractive to this company, Pellissippi State, Tennessee College of Community, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Tennessee College of Applied Technology as well. So I think, you know, some some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| those kids that are sitting in Carter High School today as a freshman will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| have job opportunities as well as other high schools throughout the county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| throughout the region. So it's definitely going to be a regional draw. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| Any other questions or comments? All right, we'll begin roll call with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2110)|

| 0:35:53| unanimously. This is a win for Knox County. We are so excited to have them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| here and the impact it will have on our community and development and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2159)|
| 0:36:08| quality of life here, I think, will be directly and greatly impacted. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| you. Thank you, Chamber. Thank you, Mayor, for all the negotiations that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| done. Thank you, Mark, everyone that's been a part of this. It's very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=2177)|

| 0:56:21| since I've been mayor, actually, during one of these meetings. If y'all are anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| like me, you cannot wait to finally wrap this up. This has been two years of planning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| talking, working with different groups, getting input from stakeholders, from you all, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| the public. It's been a lot of compromise. A lot of things have gone into this. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| never in my life, I don't think I've ever made as many people mad at me from various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3409)|

| 0:57:03| But two things. First of all, none of us got into public office as a popularity contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3423)|
| 0:57:13| We got into this to do what we think is right. And I have great respect for this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| because I think you all do that. So whichever way this goes, I know that you'll vote according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| to what you think is right. And the other thing I'd like to remind everybody is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| actually is not wrapping anything up. This is really a beginning spot. There's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| more work to do. And as has been mentioned in this past, mentioned in the past with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| plan, as we're moving forward and we see things that need to change, we can do that. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| that this gives us a good place to start. And that's what it is. So tonight, I please ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| your support on this plan. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3473)|

| 0:59:02| two years. We recognize that current guidelines developed more than 20 years ago have led in many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| cases to sprawling subdivisions that consume green space without the proper roads and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| hubs to support them. So we applaud this effort to create a wider variety of housing types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| align the infrastructure needed to support them, and include pockets of commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| to reduce road trips. What is of concern is the idea that, quote-unquote, everyone's moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| As I've heard from my neighbors, Knox County is full. So here's what the data says. Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| County's population is growing, but the largest portion of that growth are among those that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| 55 years and older. Since the 2010 census, the growth of the county's 55 plus age group is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| than that of the 0 to 24 and 25 to 54 age groups combined. Unfortunately for us, that means that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| the 25-54 demographic, a key indicator of economic prosperity, is growing at a much smaller, slower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3600)|

| 1:00:13| This demographic is who we rely on to fill jobs, start companies, who serve us as a tax base, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| volunteers and supporters for our amenities we enjoy as a community. Another data point to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| Knox County Schools has nearly 500 fewer students than it did five years ago. Even with an uptick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| in private school enrollment, this is a clear indication that the people moving here are skewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| older. The number one variable in whether Knox County can continue to prosper economically is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| talent. So the question is, can we retain and recruit the workforce needed so businesses can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| grow? To properly answer that question, we have to ensure that we have the jobs that they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| and the housing that they need and can afford. I also want to be clear that with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| agriculture is not the economic engine for Knox County that it once was, possibly generations ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| It produces less than 0.02 percent of our gross domestic product. It is also less than 0.2 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3664)|
| 1:01:12| of our employment. On a personal note, my family has been in the farming business for 199 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| and I can tell you that the loss of family farms is caused by a variety of factors, almost all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| which have nothing to do with the plan you are considering tonight. In reality, when my family's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| contemplating how to best utilize our farmland, we want policies that provide us with as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| flexibility as possible, which in turn provides us options and makes our property more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3696)|

| 1:01:46| They want to create more housing and preserve green space. This plan strikes that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=3706)|

| 1:18:07| significant and much needed step forward. In fact, one of the largest step forward in our county in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4687)|

| 1:18:34| Kevin Murphy, Knox County resident. Last year, the Realtors had a poll question on issue priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| for local government. 66 percent of respondents ranked this statement as a four or five, the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| scores. Protecting open space like fields, forest, and farmland from development. 66 percent isn't a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| vocal minority. It's a super majority in most cases, and they want protection for these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| to be a top priority. Now, they're also at that same level of support through two other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| Increasing housing that is affordable and attracting businesses to pay good jobs. And to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| successful, yes, our plan needs to do all these. On the housing and jobs side, the new growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| adds 14 square miles to the planned growth area. The comprehensive plan proposes new town centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| It permits a lot more mixed use where we have infrastructure. It encourages new approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| to increasing housing that's affordable. There's a lot of gives there for those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| But what's the give for protecting open spaces and farmland from development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| Not much, and I say that not just as me, but we have a board of advocates that are involved that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| include four former planning commissioners, one person who was a professional planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| several people that have been on the board of zoning appeals, and have served on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| Sure, this plan reduces the maximum density in the rural area from three units to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| But, and we haven't really talked about this, it shifts about 100,000 acres that's currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| sector plan designated as agricultural to rural living and rural conservation place types. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| that's a huge shift. And when it's all done, we only have about 3,500 acres left in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| that's going to have the rural agricultural place type. So we're making a really big shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| that we want to go into more rural living, rural conservation. And there's not a lot that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| going to set aside for farms. Do those rural conservation, rural living place types protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| open spaces and farmland from development? The intent is that they will, but that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| going to have to wait until there's a UDO. For now, they've got the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| that's partially related at two units an acre in the rural area and five units an acre in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| planned growth area. First, does limiting PR to two units an acre deter development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| No, and we have examples. Smithbilt told the Planning Commission that two units an acre will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| work on Roberts Road. That's in front of you tonight. Also tonight, we have a request on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4853)|

| 1:21:02| and 6,000 feet away from sewer. So two units, that doesn't deter development. Secondly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| is that still rural? I've handed out pictures of subdivisions at Carter Mill and Honey Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| which were both rezoned to two units an acre. And I showed that photo to people and asked them if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| that's rural, and the answer is always no. We're not asking you to kill this plan. We have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| here trying to help. This is our feedback through the public channels since October. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=4887)|

| 1:29:30| When the draft growth plan was released, the advocates studied it, then in mid-November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5370)|

| 1:29:42| and suggestions for policy changes. They provided local knowledge to officials to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5382)|
| 1:29:50| challenges where growth was proposed, like on North Gibbs, where proposed growth would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5390)|

| 1:30:03| Once the growth plan was approved by the coordinating committee on January 10th, a group of advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| pulled together, dug into the comprehensive plan, and on January 31st sent staff 28 pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5408)|
| 1:30:17| of observations and suggestions. This included hundreds of pages of supporting documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| like examples of plans from Nashville, Hamilton County, and other jurisdictions. All that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| was also added to the planning commission's case file, so it's on public record, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| the planning commission could have discussed any of those points in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| In short, this group is here as volunteers, trying to help make this a great plan. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5440)|
| 1:30:48| trying to help with thoughtful questions, observations, and recommendations, so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5448)|

| 1:31:36| of the comprehensive land use and transportation plan. I know this has not been easy and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| taken compromise to get where we are today. I am a realtor, a mother, and a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| member. Personally, I have three young adult children that would have a hard time buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| a home in Knoxville, so this is not necessarily just about getting outsiders coming in. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| is about my children being able to buy a home here. As a former school board member, I realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| that the majority of people that show up to speak are showing up because they're not happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| about what they're voting on. I showed up tonight to thank you for the extensive work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| that has gone into this plan and to let you know that I support it in its current form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| and I urge you to vote on it as presented tonight. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5538)|
| 1:32:30| Good evening. I'm Ryan Levinson. I'm the sacrificial lamb, I mean, past president of the East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| Realtors. First off, I would like to say that East Tennessee Realtors takes a stance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| we like to pass this as written for a couple reasons. First off, we'd like to honor the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| public process. The final version of this plan was a culmination of two years of extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| input of public input, technical guidance from subject matter experts including eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| different utility districts, TVA, Knox County Schools, and making last minute changes I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| feel undermines the public process. Secondly, I would urge you to not remove the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5584)|
| 1:33:12| in the rural place type. Reducing allowable density from three to two units an acre was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| a pretty big compromise. I would say removing that the PR density from rural living also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| substantially changes and will further reduce the density. Let's not be scared of a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| density. Density will keep the sprawl from happening and we all want a better Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| For that, on behalf of East Tennessee Realtors, we'd like to approve as written. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| Thank you. Becky Snyder followed by Megan Howard, Lonnie Harris. Hi, I'm Becky Snyder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5623)|

| 1:34:11| as president of Home Builders, we do ask that we pass advanced Knox without any of the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| tonight. The plan has been built on compromise and I do believe hearing a lot of people speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| in this room that everyone in here would agree that we all do want and need housing to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| affordable for all people and that everyone does deserve home ownership. We believe for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| people who sit on both sides of the fence of this issue that it is only fair that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| have time to navigate fully the amendments as we had the two years originally with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| growth plan. Voting as is without changes and amendments tonight ensures consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| and fairness for all sides and any alterations could potentially compromise the transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| and the trustworthiness of our commissioners. Therefore, we do urge you to support the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| plan structure as is, no amendments. Being here tonight, I heard about the Emerald Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| explaining the job potential that it could bring to our county and creating jobs. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| while we as builders, we want to build those homes for those job seekers, we want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| to afford their home. I've also heard tonight, so it's not implied, that we are all labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| as greedy developers and I know even Scott referred to himself as that and we are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| While I'm up here, I'm going to take the time to let everyone know that we actually fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| as an association daily at the state and national level to keep housing affordable. Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| 28% of cost of a home is government regulations, may it be permit fees, impact fees, co-changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| etc. And we are currently in session fighting to keep impact fees from being open-ended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| which would really hurt our housing industry. So again, we just vote that this passes as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| is. Thank you. Thank you. Megan Howard, Lonnie Harris, and Tim Graham. Hi, my name is Mary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5767)|

| 1:36:31| tract of land on Wise Springs, as well as the one on Roberts Road that is on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| tonight should not be traditional neighborhood. Rezoning this area to traditional neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| would be irresponsible, at least. At multiple different times during this meeting, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| heard several people say that they want to preserve the character of the county. If that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| were true, then designated this land traditional neighborhood is doing the complete opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| Even at the current rural limit of two dwellings per acre, you're looking at 1100 houses. 1100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| houses, even with only one car per house, which isn't realistic, still means 2200 trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| per day minimum, just for one space alone. We still haven't seen any traffic studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| being conducted. As a community, we object to this parcel even being on the map at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| but if it has to stay on the map, it needs to stay zoned agricultural. I live across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| the street from this parcel. I knew the people that owned it, and they were good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I wish they hadn't sold it, but here we are. I would like to keep farming, putting a traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| neighborhood with potentially thousands of homes right next door would completely destroy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| that. We've all heard the horror stories of farmers who were actually forced from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| land because people want to move to the county, and they love the thought of it, but when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| they're exposed to the practice, suddenly it's the farmer who's the problem. People| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| who actually call animal control because animals are making too much noise, or God forbid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| making more animals. Tennessee is a right to farm state, but that does not stop people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| from filing frivolous nuisance lawsuits. Taking a look at the area surrounding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| piece of land, it would seem that the closest piece is zoned at less than one dwelling per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| acre. Just down the road is one to two dwellings per acre. If we're really keeping with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| character of the community and prioritizing green spaces, why is it even a question to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| have more than one dwelling per acre? We keep hearing that family farms are disappearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| and people don't want to farm anymore. There's a reason for that, but the interest is growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| again. What are we going to do when people want or need to farm again, and we have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| space left in Knox County for them to do it? Please understand that when we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5911)|

| 1:38:43| We aren't saying and never have said that farms should be forced to stay farms. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| really disheartening to see people in charge gaslighting their communities by putting words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5928)|

| 1:39:14| potential residents of the future than Knox County current residents. Families like my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=5954)|

| 1:41:03| and the state legislature and they passed a law and said they couldn't report to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| My understanding is they are still reporting to them. I may be wrong. I didn't get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| in this until last Friday, I think it was, when a developer called me and said, are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| keeping up with this advanced Noxil? I said, I don't know anything about it. He started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| explaining it to me. I've done a little research. I haven't had enough time. Let me give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| a story. One of my customers told me one time. He said he was from just south of San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6084)|
| 1:41:32| At that time, this was 12 years ago, I was telling him what we were fighting. He said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| yeah, that's the way they started out there. I said, why are you doing here? He said, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| had to get out of here. It's too liberal. He said, I was in my field one day, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| ran beside, or one of his fields, which ran beside the interstate. He said, a county official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| came up and said, you've got to get your animals off this property. He said, I own this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| He said, it doesn't make any difference. The county commission here has passed an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| that you have to let the first 250 feet from the interstate go back to natural. You cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6122)|
| 1:42:10| have animals on it. I'm telling you now, these are ants nibbling at your ankles. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6130)|
| 1:42:18| not nibbling enough to bother you now, but it's going to increase. If you're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6138)|

| 1:43:01| for an hour, she doesn't want to be in politics. Nevertheless, mine is simple compared to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6181)|
| 1:43:10| points are basically the future land use map should reflect the current zoning. Here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6190)|
| 1:43:19| just four examples of some of our property. You can see the top map. The first map is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| the zoning map, the KGS zoning map. The second map is the advanced Knoxville map. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6205)|
| 1:43:33| numerous examples. Of course, I'm probably less affected than the residential, but our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| commercial property where we have a CA zone, and it's maybe the future land use is LR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6220)|
| 1:43:48| or some residential zone. Anyway, there's just not any consistency, and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| if you just simply make the land use map the same as the current map, the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6235)|
| 1:44:03| map, because sector plan equals future land use map in the, how it is now with the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| plan, it should be consistent with the zoning map because, you know, you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| landowners and a lot of landowners that aren't here that have no clue that the future sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6257)|
| 1:44:26| plan, or now it's called future land use map, is not consistent with their zoning. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| mine in a nutshell, and it's my understanding we're not rezoning any property tonight. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| will be for another day, but I really feel like the future land use map should be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| with what the zone is today. So that's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6288)|

| 1:45:53| more people to Knox County, that relief will probably be short-lived. The Knox Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6353)|
| 1:46:01| Planning Commission in its day, at the beginning of this century, had a series called Active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| Knox of talks from people from around the county who talked about planning and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| and they warned us about all kinds of economic problems that can occur if you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6377)|
| 1:46:25| the services prepared and are actually assured that you can finance them, and tax incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6385)|

| 1:46:38| hurt a lot of communities terribly. And so, that was a very good series, but I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| mostly been forgotten. The Wall Street Journal recently had an article stating that housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6405)|
| 1:46:53| and new house shortages are nothing really only in our nation, but they are common to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6413)|
| 1:47:03| a lot of industrialized countries around the world. And they say the reasons for that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6423)|
| 1:47:10| price increases, mainly in supplies of building materials, energy costs, and insurance. Insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6430)|
| 1:47:18| is a big, big factor. And the reason that is so is because of wildfires, there's much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| more natural resources, natural hazards, and natural disasters around the world these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6447)|
| 1:47:35| They don't really say anywhere it's all due to climate change, but in fact, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| triggering a lot of these shortages that are happening now. Now, the impact on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6460)|
| 1:47:48| natural assets in Knox County and the ecosystem processes was never really seriously considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6468)|
| 1:47:58| in this plan. And the planning committee did have a very focused just on economic growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6478)|
| 1:48:06| and that will really hurt future generations. And it seems to me that you're like Edward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6486)|

| 1:48:33| disregard all the messages they got about ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6513)|

| 1:49:42| been fortunate to have a background that really is surrounded by land and land use. I started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| out in recreational activities, recreational sports and growing businesses around those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| I then went on to rural land brokerage and then I went on to doing land development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| These days, I do residential land development amongst other things. I also value land conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| I volunteer my time with conservation groups and worked on conservation efforts. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| I feel like I have a balanced perspective on land use in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| Tonight, not only as a member of the community of Knoxville, I'm also here as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| development community and in support of the home builders. And if you look at the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| community, it's not just the developers, it's not just the business owners, but it's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| employees, it's their vendors, it's the employees of the vendors, it's all those folks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| you've already heard from. It's an entire ecosystem that works together and is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| is Knoxville. And if you consider the financing, the insurance, the real estate, the trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6641)|

| 1:50:54| So, it's a significant impact on what is our community. So, the decisions tonight are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| only land use decisions, but they're really decisions based on the future of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| our economic future, taxation policy, and other aspects of our lives. And really, none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6667)|
| 1:51:14| of that, in my opinion, should be rushed, including the amendments that are proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| We commend Mayor Jacobs. We commend all of those that have been involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| There's been an incredible amount of time and effort, and it's truly appreciated. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6684)|

| 1:51:36| important for the future of Knoxville. We have been on board, and when we say we, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| the development community, with concessions, changes, and the process for over two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6702)|

| 1:51:56| When you take all of the plan, all of the appendices, all of the data that supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| it, it's a tremendous effort that's represented. And the proposed amendments that are proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| for tonight undermine that two-plus-year planning process that has gone on. It's impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| to review the amendments and really analyze the implications of the amendments in less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| than a week's time since they've been made public on the forum. The amendments affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| things such as housing densities that have been discussed, land use and land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| All of these things require and deserve long, thought-out conversations and should not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6753)|
| 1:52:40| proposed at the end. So my ask tonight is that you take a vote on the plan as it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| been drafted and as it's been approved by the Planning Commission. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6767)|

| 1:54:20| That's Resolution R-24-4-409, Approving the Planning Commission Recommendation to Adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| the Knox County Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| Thank you. Before I entertain any motions on this for your consideration, we all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| quite a handful of text amendments in front of us. I have indicated that I do plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6879)|
| 1:54:49| approach each one separately. What I am asking the commission to do is to please give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6889)|
| 1:54:58| a motion and a second on this item and then when it is open for discussion, I am assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6898)|
| 1:55:07| a request for amendments will be added to the motion and then at that point I will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6907)|
| 1:55:15| amendments and any other additions that might want to be made at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| Are there any questions about that before we proceed any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| Seeing none, I am looking for a motion on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6927)|
| 1:55:34| Madam Chair, could you please explain that one more time? I am a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| Are you saying we are going to go through each agenda item, I mean the amendment first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| Is that what you are saying? I am going to read, have the motion read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| I am going to ask for a first and a second when I open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| At that point we will go into discussing amendments that may or may not be added to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6957)|
| 1:56:06| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| We have a motion on the floor to approve by Beeler, a second by Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6971)|

| 1:56:26| At this time in our discussion, I am going to read each text amendment that we have in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6986)|
| 1:56:35| or quickly hit the highlight of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=6995)|
| 1:56:43| I guess the appropriate thing at that point would be to accept or reject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7003)|
| 1:56:51| Law Director, do I need to get a motion on each amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| With each amendment, you should get a motion and a second. If there is any discussion, discussion and then vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| Thank you. We have a proper motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7020)|

| 1:58:19| these plans are specific to the type of facility systems such as roads or parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7099)|

| 2:00:40| Do we have any discussion on this item? Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7240)|

| 2:00:57| All right. Is there any other discussion on this? Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7257)|
| 2:01:02| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just, I wanted to, I think we talked about this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| but I think it's vague and I just wanted to open the opportunity up to if there's some more clarification on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7266)|
| 2:01:14| because, well, I'll just leave it at that. Thank you. Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Mandy, I forgot your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7281)|
| 2:01:29| I'd like to have your opinion on it. I believe this is one of the ones that the mayor says anything has to do with soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| That is too ambiguous. He did. This is not basing a development on the type of soil that's on the property, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| And Kathy Olson can speak more to that. We spoke about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| Basically, prime and locally important soils are found throughout the county and the city of Knoxville, the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| the planned growth area and the rural area. So we don't have a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| It just indicates that prime and locally important soils are located in rural areas as well as the other areas in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7321)|
| 2:02:10| So all the planners, you have no issue. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| Is there any other discussion? Seeing none. All those in favor? Aye. Opposed? A motion, a nay? Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7337)|
| 2:02:31| Thank you. This motion passes. Amendment five. We're looking at page 48. Frazier proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7351)|
| 2:02:42| This plan also provides a form to consider other elements of the build environment like parks and open spaces and other public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7362)|
| 2:02:53| such as stormwater and utility needs, additions, schools, historic resources and conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| Do I have a motion? Motion by Frazier. Second by Lee. Do we have any discussion on this? Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7380)|
| 2:03:09| Thank you, Madam Chair. Can I ask Commissioner Frazier, when you public infrastructure, stormwater, utility, school, historic schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7389)|
| 2:03:20| I'll stop there, are like things I can I can think of, I can see, I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| Can you further explain historic resources and then conservation is kind of an idea, not a thing to like the other things are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7405)|
| 2:03:34| Can you help explain those two more? Let me find the original text here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7414)|
| 2:03:45| So this is under the section for areas for future study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| And this supports the county's commitment to broaden the consideration and scope of impact of a project on an area during planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7429)|
| 2:03:58| So as you're looking at areas for future study, these are things that we will take into consideration when making planning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7438)|
| 2:04:08| What is a historic resource? It could be anything that's historically significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| OK, so historically significant sites. If you want to further that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7454)|
| 2:04:21| No, I'm just trying to understand what it is. Well, we were really trying to keep it fairly general so that because there had been some discussion about being too specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7461)|
| 2:04:32| And so we were keeping it fairly general so that we could be flexible because we've been asked to be flexible as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7472)|
| 2:04:42| So schools, historic resources and conservation, I feel like is are important topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7482)|
| 2:04:49| They are important things to consider when you are looking at the impact and the scope of impact of a project on an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| We are leaving those fairly general so that we can expand on those potentially in the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7495)|
| 2:05:04| OK, planning team, do you have an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| We don't have any objections to add the text. It's just looking at the small area plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7510)|
| 2:05:16| There's nothing concrete in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner Frazier. Carson, Commissioner Daly, excuse me, has a historic site in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7527)|
| 2:05:36| Would that qualify as a historic resource?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| Again, you have to look at the section that this is under and it is areas for future study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| Those will be the small area plans. So these are things that we're identifying are important to us as a county when considering the scope of impact of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7546)|
| 2:05:58| And so we are just asking for consideration of those things when you are looking at an area, especially in a small area study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7558)|
| 2:06:08| Again, this is under the section of areas for future study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7568)|
| 2:06:16| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7576)|

| 2:09:02| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to vote no on this one after conversations with the team at the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7742)|
| 2:09:12| I think they they really work on an annual schedule. Their data is based on an annual schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7752)|

| 2:09:22| I just think that it makes sense to do it once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| Versus twice. I think this has to be a data driven thing. And I think once a year is more than appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7767)|
| 2:09:35| I just want to remind commission that the impact of development on our school system was one of the top three priority issues identified as a result of advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7775)|
| 2:09:46| And I agree, I understand that it's the case, but it's just not going to it has to be data driven versus I think something might be overcrowded or something might be different the way traffic patterns is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7786)|
| 2:10:00| And I just think that school has to have a chance to be productive in their studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| And I know it is important and I think it's important. I just want to give them an opportunity to come to the table once a year with some real data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7804)|
| 2:10:15| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=7815)|

| 2:18:46| but it would be a presentation that we would give to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8326)|

| 2:19:37| Thank you, Madam Chair. Can you just clarify, Commissioner Frazier? Yes, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8377)|
| 2:19:45| going to defer to Kathy Olson. We had some great discussion about suitability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| factors and how they will change over time, and so we felt like adding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| language will just be a little reminder to us to consider those when we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| updating the comprehensive plan. When the plan was developed, we used a set of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8402)|
| 2:20:12| suitability factors that trained the model about where development was likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8412)|
| 2:20:19| to occur and what the costs of development would be. Some of those costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8419)|
| 2:20:24| were assigned to environmental constraints that make development more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| expensive, such as developing near wetlands or floodplains or steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8428)|
| 2:20:36| Some of those factors will be changeable over time, and I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8436)|
| 2:20:42| Frazier's intent is to just update those set of factors as we update the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8442)|

| 2:22:15| Just for clarification, the original says two or more and we're going to one or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| more. No, it just opposites in. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8540)|

| 2:24:04| a compromise that staff is willing to embrace if it's approved. Yes, I mean I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8644)|
| 2:24:14| will note that as Commissioner Schoonmaker pointed out, our original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8654)|

| 2:27:03| that we have certain zonings and certain land uses and they contradict each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8823)|

| 2:27:12| this all for me. That's correct, Commissioner. We do have some conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8832)|

| 2:27:28| necessarily about the addition of this. It's basically just restating that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| not related or appropriate when you're looking at this matrix, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8852)|

| 2:28:44| the appropriate time then. I believe so. Okay, based on conversation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8924)|

| 2:29:45| appropriate. Friendly amendment, PR zero up to two, partially related. PR zero up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8985)|
| 2:29:56| to two. All right. Is that noted? PR parentheses, zero up to two, wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=8996)|
| 2:30:08| partially related. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Oh, all right, hold on. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9008)|
| 2:30:17| is a motion, friendly amendment motion by Frazier. Is there a second? Second. Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9017)|

| 2:30:41| We talked about this last week. I'm still of the opinion that the 11 that are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9041)|
| 2:30:48| this board at the time should be making the decision of what's appropriate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| the given situation. I hate the idea of limiting what we can and can't do in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| future, especially we don't know what the circumstances are going to be. Does staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| have any opinion on this change? We have no objections to this change. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9061)|
| 2:31:12| Daly. Mr. Commissioner Ward asked my question. Thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9072)|
| 2:31:21| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor of the PR. Madam Chair. Sorry, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9081)|
| 2:31:32| Commissioner, Commissioner. Director Brooks was trying to get your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| Commissioner Brooks, did you have a comment on this? I apologize. It would be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| I think, to get a clarification from changing it from up to two to zero up to two and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9102)|
| 2:31:49| the intent of that is. Thank you, Director Brooks. Yes, I just know in the past we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| had requests or zonings at .2, .3, and I just wanted to clarify the language. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9114)|
| 2:32:05| a clarification of language. Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it doesn't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9125)|
| 2:32:22| our position. I think that in terms of how staff typically deals with this, up to two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| would include zero as well. All right. So, for a clarification then, Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9146)|
| 2:32:40| Brooks, this is still in keeping in line with your general wording throughout. Yes, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9160)|
| 2:32:56| I'm fine with the wording as is if Director Brooks states that it is zero up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| The same? Yes. I just know we've had discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| zero to two. All right. So, would you like to restate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| your motion, Commissioner? Motion to approve PR up to two partially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| related. And the second is good. Thank you. So, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9199)|
| 2:33:30| have an appropriate motion on the floor by Frazier, second by Buehler. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| Okay. I just want to see your motion is striking the two to five partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9216)|
| 2:33:46| Yes, from the rural area. I'm happy to restate that. PR up to two partially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| related, striking PR two to five partially related. So, it is as originally worded in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9229)|
| 2:33:56| her amendment. Director Brooks, you're okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9236)|
| 2:34:05| Yes. All right. Seeing no other lights, all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9245)|
| 2:34:12| in favor? Aye. Opposed? Ward is the name. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9252)|

| 2:35:01| a motion? Motion to approve. Motion by Schoonmaker, second by Lee. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9301)|
| 2:35:12| discussion on this item? Commissioner Ward? It's staff's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9312)|
| 2:35:21| Do you want me to go first? Okay. We do not support this amendment at all. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9321)|
| 2:35:33| Frazier and the advocates came to us and asked us to place rural place types into the PGA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| And if we would have known that the request would be to decrease density in the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| conservation place type, we would not have agreed to that. So, we do not support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9345)|
| 2:35:49| amendment moving forward. Commissioner Ward? I agree with staff at this point. I'll wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9349)|
| 2:35:58| to hear from all the other commissioners before I make a substitute. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9358)|
| 2:36:05| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mandy, we discussed this, correct? We did. I shared with you exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9365)|
| 2:36:12| what I just said, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Okay. And then there wasn't a point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9372)|
| 2:36:17| we wanted Director Brooks to explain. She can speak to the rural conservation place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9377)|
| 2:36:26| type and the benefits. Director Brooks? Yes. So, rural conservation, that place type was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9386)|
| 2:36:35| created specifically in anticipation of allowing new zone or zones that allow for conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9395)|
| 2:36:42| subdivisions. We've discussed conservation subdivisions and those ideas for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| now. And in general, conservation subdivisions allow for condensing to develop lots on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9407)|
| 2:36:56| property to protect environmentally sensitive and agriculturally valuable and aesthetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| and culturally important areas. In the process of condensing these lot sizes and these lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9420)|
| 2:37:06| areas, it allows for the areas of a property that are often the most difficult and most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9426)|
| 2:37:13| expensive to be avoided and allows for open space and habitat to be preserved. And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9433)|
| 2:37:21| generally requires less infrastructure. This meets multiple goals of this planning effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| and the public input that we've received over the last couple of years. Okay. And as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9445)|
| 2:37:32| example, if there's 20 acres, but 10 of the acres are not buildable due to constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9452)|
| 2:37:42| you could still put 20 homes on the 10 acres that are remaining. Depending on the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9462)|
| 2:37:51| that was approved by this body. Well, if it was the first one, if it's one dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| per acre and you've got 20 acres, that's 20 homes. But you can't build on 10 acres. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9476)|
| 2:38:01| can only build on the other 10. That would still give you 20 homes on 10 acres. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9481)|
| 2:38:07| On the developable portion of the property. Yes. Okay. And then if it was in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| analogy in the PGA, you could have 60 homes on the 10 acres. Potentially, depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9493)|
| 2:38:27| the zoning that was approved, the density that was approved by this body under plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| residential zone. Yes, you could condense those lots on the more developable portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| of the property. And that would be encouraged if you were aiming to preserve certain portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9518)|
| 2:38:43| of this site to protect it for some reason or another. Okay. Thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9523)|
| 2:38:52| Gray. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to vote no on this one. Again, I think the negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9532)|
| 2:39:03| between the team has been very upfront and very thorough. And to essentially take a giant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9543)|
| 2:39:09| negotiation tool and element and change it at the last minute, I'm really not comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| with. I think we've established two units an acre on our sort of minimum worlds here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9556)|
| 2:39:23| across the board. And I just think this goes a little bit too far. So, I'm going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9563)|
| 2:39:27| no on this. I see no other lights. Motion is on the floor for approval of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9567)|

| 2:40:45| proposal. Recommend a minimum density of five dwelling units for PR zones. I am speculating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9645)|
| 2:41:02| well I am stating instead of the two listed categories as in the original text. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| correct, Commissioner Schoonmaker? Yes. I guess my question is, should this align with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9668)|
| 2:41:19| the corridor commercial? Is that directed to staff? Yes. Okay. I'll attempt to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9679)|
| 2:41:42| this one. So, we know, as we've mentioned, we have this new plan that we drafted. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| have an old code. I think one of the things that we were thinking about, especially for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| the corridor mixed use, is that we might potentially have some larger sites that might be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| for a corridor mixed use. And they might be adjacent to some lower density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9718)|
| 2:42:05| And so, providing additional flexibility, so allowing someone who has a larger site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9725)|
| 2:42:09| to say, okay, we want to develop more intensely along the corridor, but we want to add some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| housing to this and allow there to be a transition back to that lower density residential. These| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9733)|
| 2:42:19| are just all hypothetical situations, but we just wanted to provide some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| flexibility as we are working towards this new code. Does that help answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9742)|
| 2:42:29| Commissioner? So, if you've got a 40-acre site and you want to do 10 acres and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| strictly residential, I'm saying the minimum density of five dwelling units an acre for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9756)|
| 2:42:42| the PR zone. And you're saying that you don't want to do that? I'm not saying that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9762)|
| 2:42:46| want to do that. I'm saying that we just wanted some additional flexibility and to allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9766)|
| 2:42:51| some different recommendations. Anybody else have any input or should I pull it? Are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9771)|
| 2:43:01| pulling it or would you like to hear more discussion? I'd like to hear more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| All right. Commissioner Daly. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would vote to pull it because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9786)|
| 2:43:15| that staff needs flexibility. So, I would be voting no on that one. Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9795)|
| 2:43:27| I think the same thing. I think the 11 should be able to vote and see what's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| at the time. Commissioner Frazier. I was just going to comment to Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9812)|
| 2:43:38| that I did look at this and ask the question of if these are the place types where we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9818)|
| 2:43:45| to put more density, would it be appropriate to require a minimum? And so, that was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| a discussion point. I've had a great discussion with the staff. I don't think we should omit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| the flexibility of zero to five. And I do think this is something that as we get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9836)|
| 2:44:01| the UDO, we will revisit these place types and that may be something that we revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9841)|
| 2:44:06| at that time. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd like to remove this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9846)|
| 2:44:12| item from discussion. Seeing the will of the body. All right. Let the record reflect. Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9852)|
| 2:44:20| 21 has been withdrawn. All right. Looking at Amendment 22. Original text reads, Suburban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9860)|
| 2:44:45| residential. Schoonmaker proposal. Before I read this, Commissioner Schoonmaker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9885)|
| 2:44:57| I saw you had your line up. I'm just going to clarify something with Mandy. Let me state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9897)|
| 2:45:04| it. Thank you. In planned growth areas, allow up to five. PR1 to 2, partially related. PR2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9904)|
| 2:45:14| to 5, partially related. Eliminate the last two categories, 5, 9, and 9, 12. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9914)|
| 2:45:25| Schoonmaker, would you like to speak to this before we ask for motions? That would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9925)|
| 2:45:33| Sure. Go ahead. Mandy on the executive team. We do not support this amendment, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9933)|
| 2:45:42| Schoonmaker. Okay. Were you originally supposed to pull this? I think you were. Because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9942)|
| 2:45:51| your amendment. Okay. I'll defer to any other discussion and then move quickly. I'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9951)|
| 2:46:00| ahead and withdraw Amendment 22. All right. Thank you. Looking around the room. Let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9960)|
| 2:46:08| record reflect that Amendment 22 also has been withdrawn. If I might say, it was great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9968)|
| 2:46:17| working at the 11th hour with Mandy to try to work through some of these things. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| why it still showed up in print. That is an understatement, Commissioner Schoonmaker. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9980)|
| 2:46:26| all been fabulous. All right. Looking at... Let's see. I believe we are still under...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=9986)|
| 2:46:40| We're converting to rural conservation. All right. Now, I need to go back just a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10000)|
| 2:46:50| here for my records. Hold on. Yeah. All right. We are still on Amendment 22. The first proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10010)|
| 2:47:01| change has been withdrawn by Schoonmaker. Still on... No, that completes Amendment 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10021)|
| 2:47:13| All right. Is everybody with me? All right. We are moving forward to map amendments. Did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10033)|
| 2:47:24| you have a question? Oh, goodness. All right. Hold on just a second. I'm helping our clerks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10044)|
| 2:47:39| with their appropriate copies. All right. I think I'm seeing that some people... It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10059)|
| 2:47:53| is page 12. Madam Chair, mine stops at page 11. All right. Well, we have a clerical glitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10073)|
| 2:48:06| You know what? I think when the last second plan was given to us, it looks like page 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10086)|
| 2:48:15| was omitted. Of course, it was. That's what happened. You all should have an electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10095)|
| 2:48:23| copy of it, Drusilla. Okay. Yes. It was what was originally... It was in what was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10103)|
| 2:48:41| posted. Then at the right before we came in, there were some not changes, but really addendums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10121)|
| 2:48:51| added to the original text. I think when it was reprinted, it was inadvertently overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10131)|
| 2:49:07| So who needs a copy of page 12? I don't know how they did it. Yes. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10147)|
| 2:49:13| On the last email from Drew, it says the updated map finally got my printer to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10153)|
| 2:49:22| It's actually page 1011 if you pull it up. And it's Commissioner Beeler's. It's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10162)|
| 2:49:31| It was sent in the original document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| Who needs a copy? On the email, there's two files. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10175)|
| 2:49:45| I can also pull up the document on the screen if that's what you guys would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| Thank you. That would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10189)|
| 2:49:55| Madam Chair, I believe the question is, are there maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| to correlate with the parcel lists? There are maps available. I will tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10198)|
| 2:50:08| Mandy did ask me about actually printing every single copy of these. And it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10208)|
| 2:50:18| dozens and dozens. While we're discussing, since these three involve Beeler amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10218)|
| 2:50:29| Commissioner Biddler, would you like to just at least begin addressing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| Sure. I can. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| I will ask this. Do we have a map available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10236)|
| 2:50:42| We can pull it up. I can go help Drew real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10242)|
| 2:50:44| Thank you. That will be really helpful. It's just a lot of parcels for the Commission to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10244)|
| 2:50:49| This amendment that was given to us, you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| it's a map of the parcel list. It's a map of the parcel list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| It's a map of the parcel list. It's a map of the parcel list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| It isn't nearly as complicated as it looks. It's four well-defined areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10260)|
| 2:51:16| One of them just has a lot of parcels in it. Did everybody receive the parcel list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10276)|
| 2:51:23| Yes. I believe we all got hard copies of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| Okay. Hold on one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| Commissioner Beeler, perhaps you could work on at least define the parameters that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10287)|
| 2:51:32| Certainly. I'll do my best. I mean, the first one, do we have, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10292)|
| 2:51:39| So, the first one is a large area. There we go. That's okay. Can we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10299)|
| 2:51:46| Okay. Let's speak to that one first. Okay. I think this is number four, actually. Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10306)|
| 2:51:52| Sorry. Sure. If it's got the changes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10312)|
| 2:51:59| I just emailed the link to the map to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10319)|
| 2:52:13| Not cutting through yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10333)|
| 2:52:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10337)|
| 2:52:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| If you all would just hold tight just a second. Director Brooks, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10341)|
| 2:52:28| Yeah. I just wanted to provide some clarification. So, because you all have not voted on these map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| amendments, they are not actually shown on the map as proposed amendments. I just want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| that. But we can zoom in. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10360)|
| 2:52:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10361)|
| 2:52:41| For clarification, though, if you all will just listen to Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10361)|
| 2:52:46| I will tell you that it is not as complicated as it looks at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| It is not. I assure you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| In map one, that large area of rural conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10373)|
| 2:53:00| the amendment proposes that it be changed to rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10380)|
| 2:53:06| There are 365 parcels in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10386)|
| 2:53:12| They are more appropriate for rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10392)|
| 2:53:19| There really aren't parcels in there that would be appropriate for subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| There's a lot of smaller parcels that already have homes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| There's a large drainage area in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10408)|
| 2:53:34| I will refer now to either Mandy or Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10414)|
| 2:53:42| Is the team okay with that amendment from R.C. to R.L.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10422)|
| 2:53:53| You, Commissioner, not Commissioner, Director Snowden, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10433)|
| 2:53:59| I can speak to it. Mandy may have some other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| This area that Commissioner Beeler is speaking to is a very, very large sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10442)|
| 2:54:07| that has been problematic for us through the floods of 2019 and 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10447)|
| 2:54:13| as well as just some of the transportation challenges in that area due to the presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10453)|
| 2:54:19| of Murphy Creek and the railroad running very close to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10459)|
| 2:54:25| So the leadership team does not have a problem with this modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| And I believe I'm correct also that this is something that Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| has been discussing with you for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| This is not an 11th hour. No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10477)|
| 2:54:41| Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10481)|

| 3:02:22| We have found what I believe to be an outstanding tenant for the park, but we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10942)|
| 3:02:29| that we honor our commitments to the community, and it essentially says all the area in purple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| that is east of Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10956)|
| 3:02:37| If you wouldn't mind putting the cursor on Midway Road for us right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| Everything east of that line that is currently in the rural crossroads commercial, both south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10960)|
| 3:02:46| and north of Thorngrove Pike, would be changed to the rural living place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10966)|
| 3:02:53| The area in purple west of Midway Road would remain as is, and so would any parcels north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10973)|
| 3:02:59| of Thorngrove Pike that are already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10979)|
| 3:03:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| Did you get the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10992)|
| 3:03:13| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| We don't actually have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10997)|
| 3:03:18| Motion by Beeler, second by Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=10998)|
| 3:03:21| Fine, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11005)|
| 3:03:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11006)|
| 3:03:28| For the online version, will the document be changed where it says Beeler proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11008)|
| 3:03:35| to red ink that says rural living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| Because right now you've made all the changes in red except for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| Well, these are math changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| Yeah, but it's on the typeface for the document that was emailed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| I can change it, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11031)|
| 3:03:52| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11033)|
| 3:03:53| Just for the folks at home that are following along and looking, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11033)|
| 3:03:58| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| I'm going to push back a little bit on this one because the demand in that area is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11041)|
| 3:04:05| to go through the roof, especially with adding at least 400 jobs, if not 2,000 jobs over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11045)|
| 3:04:11| the next five, 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| And the demand for lunch break and gas stations and everything else to support that large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11053)|
| 3:04:20| of a $300 million investment is really going to be needed, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11060)|
| 3:04:28| I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11068)|
| 3:04:29| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11069)|
| 3:04:29| But I don't know if I can support this one, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11069)|
| 3:04:38| Very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| If I may respond, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| Certainly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11081)|
| 3:04:42| Love you too, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| So, no, I understand exactly where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11084)|
| 3:04:49| We feel like that the areas east of Midway Road and the areas directly adjacent to Interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11089)|
| 3:04:56| 40, which are just below that map, will be sufficient to handle those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| But certainly free to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11100)|
| 3:05:04| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11104)|
| 3:05:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| Commissioner Boehler, is that where the crypto was going to go in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11109)|
| 3:05:17| Perhaps, if your memory serves you correctly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11117)|
| 3:05:20| And a Dollar General, if I'm not mistaken, was going to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| So that's right there on the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| I'm going to agree with, I'm going to vote against this one, just because I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11131)|
| 3:05:37| what will happen is if we don't have opportunities, it's going to, if you remember, if you go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11137)|
| 3:05:43| on the map just a little bit, the city of Knoxville has annexed all the way out to Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| Road and everything right around the actual interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| And if we push everything else, if we don't have any other option, then we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11151)|
| 3:05:56| lose a lot of tax revenue, potentially, down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| For commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| And we have to, we are, this area will need to, commercial, housing, et cetera, to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11160)|
| 3:06:08| this amazing opportunity we have for a lot of really high paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| And I just, I would like to, I think we need the flexibility to adapt as things develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11172)|
| 3:06:18| out there instead of sort of locking things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| So I'm also going to vote no, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11180)|
| 3:06:25| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| Just, I hate being this guy, but we all talked about the Dollar General a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11187)|
| 3:06:36| And the conversation that night was, we don't feel like development should go in until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11196)|
| 3:06:41| have somebody in that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| And now we have somebody in that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| You know, it's the appropriate time to start developing that area to create the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11206)|
| 3:06:51| system that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11211)|
| 3:06:52| And as Commissioner Jay pointed out, I'd rather have the cash registers in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11212)|
| 3:06:57| than the cash registers in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| That's the whole point of creating $300 million in investment so that we could create more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11219)|
| 3:07:04| tax dollars in revenue from this whole site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11224)|
| 3:07:08| Because it's not just the industrial park, it's everything surrounding the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11228)|
| 3:07:13| park as well that's going to come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| And I would like staff's comments on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11235)|
| 3:07:22| Yeah, we met once again, Commissioner Begler, and generally agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11242)|
| 3:07:27| One thing I will mention in the traffic study for the Midway Business Park, once they hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11247)|
| 3:07:34| a certain threshold number of jobs, there are additional traffic improvements that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11254)|
| 3:07:39| need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11259)|
| 3:07:39| Once they hit a certain threshold number of jobs, there are additional traffic improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11259)|
| 3:07:44| that may need to be kicked in, one of which is a traffic signal at the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| Midway at Thorn Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11268)|
| 3:07:49| So, you know, there could be a possibility at that point that a change of condition will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| be made and a map amendment could be looked at at that point once that growth occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11274)|
| 3:08:00| But at this point in time, we do agree with Commissioner Begler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11286)|
| 3:08:06| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| We have a motion to, on a map 4, to approve by Begler, second by Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11290)|
| 3:08:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11297)|
| 3:08:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11298)|
| 3:08:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| Jay and Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11301)|
| 3:08:25| Who is no, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| Jay and Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11308)|
| 3:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| All right, this motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11310)|
| 3:08:37| We are looking at future land use map 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11317)|
| 3:08:40| This is a proposal brought by Hill, change from suburban residential to rural crossroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11320)|
| 3:08:50| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| This plot of land and the parcel numbers there, Mandy, is there any chance you could pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11333)|
| 3:09:00| that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11340)|
| 3:09:01| I will tell you it is a three-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11341)|
| 3:09:07| There is probably not more than one acre that is even developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11347)|
| 3:09:11| It is right on a three-way corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11351)|
| 3:09:16| It is virtually landlocked by Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| Right now it is used as nothing but a cut-through and dumping ground half of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11361)|
| 3:09:29| It would be a perfect, perfect location for a convenience store, small gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11369)|
| 3:09:36| something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11376)|
| 3:09:37| So, that is the reason for my motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11377)|
| 3:09:42| Can you clarify the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11382)|
| 3:09:44| Parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11384)|
| 3:09:45| Yes, to change this from suburban residential to rural crossroads commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11385)|
| 3:09:52| This property is located on a three-way intersection, very isolated, only 1.2 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11392)|
| 3:09:59| of it is even considered buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| The parcel number is listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| Motion by Hill, second by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| Is there any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| Can you give us a picture of where this is at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| Yes, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| We have two state roads, Byington Beaver Ridge that runs into Emory Road in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11420)|
| 3:10:27| There's recently, thank the Lord for Director Snowden stepped up and finally put us a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11427)|

| 3:10:43| Improvements are long overdue, promised to widen Emory Road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11443)|
| 3:10:47| So, it's going to be a very commercial looking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11447)|
| 3:10:53| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| Just to echo what Commissioner Hill just said, I know this intersection extremely well, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11454)|
| 3:11:00| thank you as well for the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| It's been needed for years, but I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| I've always said since I've been doing service in that area eight, nine years ago, that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11466)|
| 3:11:11| should be a commercial corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11471)|
| 3:11:12| There's a huge demand for need in that area for commercial, and I think this is very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11472)|
| 3:11:20| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11480)|
| 3:11:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11483)|
| 3:11:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11484)|
| 3:11:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11484)|
| 3:11:26| Map five, change, carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| This is an appropriate time to also mention, I had some other land use amendments literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11492)|
| 3:11:40| given to me at the 11th hour, that there was not time to bring them up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11500)|
| 3:11:48| There was not time to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| Director Brooks, if I'm repeating you correctly, you did remind me that quarterly this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11511)|
| 3:11:57| will be able to propose new land use amendments to the current map to bring those forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11517)|
| 3:12:07| for change and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11531)|
| 3:12:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11532)|
| 3:12:13| Because as we get deeper and deeper into this, we are all going to find pockets probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| like this that we see perhaps should have been looked at a little differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11538)|
| 3:12:24| So, that's just a side comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11544)|
| 3:12:28| All right, this concludes our amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11548)|
| 3:12:34| Are there any other amendments at this time to be brought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11554)|
| 3:12:38| Seeing none, two more questions before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| make this final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11563)|
| 3:12:46| Planning staff, are there any of these amendments that would be considered, in your view, deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11566)|
| 3:12:56| breakers with our mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11576)|
| 3:13:03| I think we've spoke to the ones that we had concerns with when they came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11583)|
| 3:13:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11588)|
| 3:13:09| Any comments or questions about my question there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11589)|
| 3:13:13| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11595)|
| 3:13:16| I have a question for our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11596)|
| 3:13:18| I just want to make sure that all of these amendments have been at least discussed or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11598)|
| 3:13:23| touched upon at Planning Commission and there is no need for them to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11603)|
| 3:13:29| Yes, I've discussed this with Ms. Brooks and we don't believe there's any of these that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| need to go back to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11612)|
| 3:13:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11613)|
| 3:13:34| That was actually my question number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11618)|
| 3:13:42| This has been coming for probably seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11622)|
| 3:13:49| I advocated to update our plans and our zoning ordinances as a citizen living in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11629)|
| 3:13:57| and seeing growth and development happen all around me and not understanding how or why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11637)|
| 3:14:04| we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| I had no idea that it would ever land me in this arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11647)|
| 3:14:14| I resisted it for a long time, but man, I'm glad I'm here and I'm glad and I feel privileged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11654)|
| 3:14:20| to be a part of this because I do think that this is transformational for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11660)|
| 3:14:29| So one more time, I want to thank Mayor Jacobs for being the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11669)|
| 3:14:35| You were the one out of three that said, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11675)|
| 3:14:41| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11681)|
| 3:14:41| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| He was the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11683)|
| 3:14:43| He was, I mean, this is kind of funny, but he was the man big enough to take this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11683)|
| 3:14:49| and it has been a gigantic pain in the butt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11689)|
| 3:14:55| But I just want to say how grateful I am for the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11695)|
| 3:15:01| This team has worked so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| They have always been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| They have been receptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| They have been responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| They have given great advice, exceptional guidance, and this would not have been possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11710)|
| 3:15:19| without this executive team and the leadership team working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11719)|
| 3:15:24| So we don't say thank you enough or I don't say thank you enough and I'm really working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11724)|
| 3:15:30| on that, but I appreciate you all so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| I also want to say thank you to everyone who took part in Advance Knox and were a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11734)|
| 3:15:42| of advisory groups, stakeholder groups, citizen participants, people just here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11742)|
| 3:15:51| You know, I sometimes get a bad rap and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11751)|
| 3:15:59| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11759)|
| 3:15:59| We all kind of get a bad rap every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| I do want to see Knox County grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| I really do and I think this is the way to do it and this is a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11765)|
| 3:16:09| We've still got a lot of work to do, a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11769)|
| 3:16:13| If you think this was hard, wait till we get into the studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11773)|
| 3:16:17| But to say all of that, I'm really excited to be here in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11777)|
| 3:16:23| So I'm just going to enjoy it for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| And I said the other day I'm all out of tears and I'm all out of apologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11785)|
| 3:16:30| but I'm really looking forward to getting this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| So thank you for all of you for hanging in there, for having the hard conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11792)|
| 3:16:37| for letting me be the thorn in your side, for actually listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11797)|
| 3:16:43| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11803)|

| 3:16:49| So here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11812)|
| 3:16:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11812)|

| 3:16:55| Y'all, we haven't voted on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| All right, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11820)|
| 3:17:01| Just a question or if I can state it correctly to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11821)|
| 3:17:05| I understand Commissioner Beeler's a lot of land going and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11825)|
| 3:17:13| But if we start going to change single partials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11833)|
| 3:17:17| is that not circumventing the process of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11837)|
| 3:17:21| coming to planning, say, hey, let's look at changing from RRC to RL?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11841)|
| 3:17:29| You see, you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11849)|
| 3:17:33| Was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| We are signing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11856)|
| 3:17:37| Okay, that answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11857)|
| 3:17:38| I just want to make sure that we're not circumventing planning that review process or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11858)|

| 3:19:08| Having said that, we have no ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11948)|
| 3:19:13| Hold on, you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240422?start=11953)|
