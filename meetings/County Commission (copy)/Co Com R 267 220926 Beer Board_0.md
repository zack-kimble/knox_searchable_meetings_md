| 0:08:15| I will in a minute, who owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| You've been having concerts out there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=503)|

| 0:08:28| Illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| They're not approved, concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| I gave everyone this here, and I'll give you a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=511)|

| 0:08:46| Under ordinance, if it doesn't say you can, you can't do it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| So once you get this beer license, that don't mean next Saturday you can have an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| For all my fellow commissioners, this is at Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| We found this at South Carolina, and we're working on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| This will cover Charlie's Bustlers, living on the property while the house is being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| and other things on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| I just want to confirm with our law department, and you understand, just because you get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| beer permit today, until we pass this ordinance, which will be about 90 days or so, you cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=564)|
| 0:09:31| have a concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Mr. Doral, Director, did I state that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| You stated it correctly, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| And we are working, we are working as fast as we can, I promise you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Steve has jumped on it like that, and Planning, so once we plan against it, they'll send it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| to their approval at the Planning Commissioners, then it'll come for us for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| But it's going to take about 90 days, Steve, maybe a little longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| I would say 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Is this an event venue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Is this a bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| What is the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Well, it's basically a farm, but we don't do the events on the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| We do the events outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| We ran mobile restrooms, and we had a stage, mobile stage, and we had a food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| So like a food truck hall, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| So that's, I mean, I'm just trying to visualize it, and it's obviously an old photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| Yeah, this used to be Bayo Seeds Company's plant, where they went out and got the seed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| put it in their little Mayo packets, and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| So it's an old factory that's got a dock, a concrete dock, where they can back up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| trucks to load and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| So I have no problem with the event venue and everything, as long as everything's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| But it was the old Mayo Seed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| And who, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| I'll wait until the discussion's done, but I'll be happy to make the motion on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| of the District 9 representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| Why would we want to issue a beer permit to an entity that can't sell beer on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| till the zoning and all that is completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Why wouldn't we not just defer this till the zoning is in place, where then he could properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| get a beer license from Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| I think, and I'd have to ask Codes and Fire Marshal, that he's asking for a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| for that building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| And if granted the permit, he could sell the beer there, subject to Codes' certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| of occupancy, and the Fire Marshal's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So there is a facility there that he could sell beer out of, if he's granted the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| He could have a food truck haul and sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| I mean, there's five or six of those that have a bar in the middle and have food trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| that sell beer and food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| It doesn't have anything to do with events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| So is it zoned industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| It was industrial, and then they took it back to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| So they thought that they could hold events in agricultural, rodeos and concerts and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| that, which you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| So, he could or could not use the beer license if it was approved today, pending the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=752)|
| 0:12:43| of the 90 days you're talking about going through Knox Planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| That would be for Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I think about 50% of the property is still zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| The applicant has had conversations with us about having rodeos there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| So we think that would be appropriate for the ag zoning, and then the industrial would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| allow him to have the food trucks or serve the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| The beer permit is not, as I understand it, he's asked for a beer permit at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| subject to the zoning, subject to Codes, subject to Fire Marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-beer-board?start=799)|
