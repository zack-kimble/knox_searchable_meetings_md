| 0:03:43| For all of those that are here on violations, I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| this so I don't have to repeat it every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| So all of you listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| The way this procedure works is the allegation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| illegal sale to a minor will be stated and the facts will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| be stated by Officer Cole from the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| You will then have a chance to either admit or deny those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| allegations and to tell this beer board anything that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| would like to say with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| At that point, it will be turned over to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| and they will deliberate on how to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| And as you come up, if you have any questions about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| procedure, just simply raise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| So do you have any questions, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| When do I testify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| You will testify after the officer gives the statement of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| facts with regard to the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Go ahead, Officer Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=273)|

| 0:05:05| May 6th is the correct date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=305)|

| 0:05:12| I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Do you admit or deny the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| No, that did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=315)|

| 0:05:25| this type of, you know, thing happening at our location is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| I mean, we do have a scanning system in place which scans the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| IDs before, you know, we just have to scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| And we do have a corporate policy in which states that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| hey, they do have to read and sign where it says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| check IDs and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=344)|

| 0:05:51| And he's no longer with us because he didn't follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| rules or didn't check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=354)|

| 0:06:44| He was there as a dish boy and then I had to go to the bank and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| then he was a cashier for probably less than a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| I think, and I could prove that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| So I really don't know if he does or does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| Okay, so before you put him on the cash register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| you didn't verify if he'd obtained his certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| So I require that from him and he, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| I never got a straight answer, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| So was the software program in place to check the IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| The thing is we just opened up, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| three months ago and I made sure that was the very first things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| that we have, you know, in place where they scan the ID and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| don't have to punch it in or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Correct, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Well, because the beer permit was issued on March 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=461)|
| 0:07:41| And then 61 days later, you're now in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| I mean, this is the first time, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| we just opened, like I said, three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| but we have other stores where in the past ten years or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| 15 years, you know, even my parents' stores or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| we never had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| And like I said, this was a new employee and I was working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| like, 4 a.m. to, like, 11 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| so I was desperate to hire employees and I couldn't find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| the right fit and I had to work with what I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| which was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| But I'm checking cameras constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| I'm there literally all day long from 4 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| all the way to, like, 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| sometimes all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| One, because of this mistake happened and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| well, I'm making sure this doesn't happen again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| because it's very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| I mean, we just opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| We're still trying to build clientele and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| I'm doing whatever I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=517)|

| 0:11:00| If you could state your name and address, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=660)|

| 0:11:13| and had everybody sign off that they understand the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| and procedure of checking IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| for every person that's consuming alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=678)|

| 0:11:25| so if anybody feels that they need to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| for an ID a second time, we encourage that they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| just to maintain that we are following the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=690)|

| 0:12:30| Director Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Did you understand the procedure here, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Okay, then I will turn it over to Deputy Cole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| to give the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| On June 7th, 2021, at approximately 19.40 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| the Sheriff's Office completed a compliance check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Defendant sold an alcoholic beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| to an underage person after checking their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| The defendant scanned the ID and then typed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| a different date of birth into the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| That's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Sir, do you admit or deny the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I admit, but I'd like to explain kind of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| You can explain, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Do you admit or deny, and then you can explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| I admit that happened, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Okay, go ahead and explain however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Just prior to them coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| the clerk that usually runs the register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| became sick, started throwing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| We got that person out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| so we didn't have, due to our lack of employment right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| we didn't have another person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| so we brought a person out of the deli| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| that had some prior experience at another store up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| to just try to get us through the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| And she had never ran the register there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| She was trying to run the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| She was trying to put the ID in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| When she couldn't get it to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| there was a long line of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| She was assuming that she'd done it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| And one thing led to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| so she just went ahead and sold it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| to get the person out to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| But the inexperience and us in a bad situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| kind of created a, you know, misfortune of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| So we've had a bureaucrat since 1983, no problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| you know, been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Just kind of misfortune and a bad afternoon for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| and lack of employment due to COVID going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| not enough experienced people at the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| You're going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Actually, you have two different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| You can do a $1,000 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| or a 30-day suspension of your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| I'll take the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| but I think it was bad circumstances, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| I don't know how we could prevent what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| We have class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| We have everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=875)|
| 0:14:35| Just that particular instance was just a bad deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| It's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=882)|
| 0:14:42| Make a motion for a $1,000 fine, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Do you have, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| Mr. Vineyard, you've been in business since 1983?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| And you've never had a violation before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| I can't remember one that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| I checked back maybe 20, 20 or 30 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| when we first started a lot of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| before we put in the scan systems and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| We may have had one then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| but I really can't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| because we have multiple stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| I can't remember if we had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| We had one in Anderson County back 22, 23 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| But I don't think anything in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| that I know of that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Well, it sounds like you have a lot of systems in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| and do a good job with your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| It's unfortunate this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| but this is the way the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| But I did want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| that that's a pretty amazing track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Any further discussion on item 5C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| We have a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| for a $1,000 fine and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=953)|

| 0:16:06| District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Is the owner representative here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| If he could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=970)|

| 0:16:27| And are you the manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=987)|

| 0:16:31| Did you understand what I said about the procedure here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Deputy Cole, if you'd go ahead and make the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| On June 7th, 2021, at approximately 1906 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| officers with the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| completed a compliance check at the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| 1915 East Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| The defendant sold an alcoholic beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| to the underage person after checking their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Okay, before you answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| have you been sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| When I swore everybody in, were you sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Yes, sir, I was present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Go ahead, do you admit or deny the allegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| that the Sheriff's deputy has just given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| I do admit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Okay, now you can say anything you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| to this beer board with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Just speaking on the team member's behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| he is actually a member of the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| He is actually fairly new with PILOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| and I'm just not exactly sure if he's completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| his alcohol and tobacco certification class yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| so we have had that reissued to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| as well as the rest of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| This is not something that happens a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| and this is the first violation I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| and we're just gonna do our recertifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| and take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Okay, are you taking this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1081)|

| 0:18:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| I noticed on here that it's 18 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| that kind of went away that you had a real good record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| and that's also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| it's good that it took you 18 years to get this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| but it's bad that this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| You have been a great, I guess, partner in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| which I work in for different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| and, but you have a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Yes, sir, we'll take the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| Make a motion that we have a $1,000 fine for PILOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| first by Commissioner Busler for $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| You guys have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| If you'll get with the clerk to pay the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| and good luck going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Yes, sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1136)|
| 0:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Country Burrito Fresh Mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| 10636 Hardin Valley Road, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| Is the owner with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| You could state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Yes, Martin Coving, 10636 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Hey, sir, do you understand the procedure here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Deputy Cole, if you would read the allegation, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| On 6-7-21, approximately 1927 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| the Sheriff's Office conducted a compliance check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| The country burrito,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| the suspect sold underage person frozen margaritas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| without checking their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Hey, sir, do you admit or deny that allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| And you're free to say whatever you want to this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Okay, while this employee's been with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| for three years and we were so busy at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| I don't know how it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| And we are doing meetings with all the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| to make sure that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| But this is the first time, you know, that we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| So we made sure that it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| I guess this is a question for the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| but I thought I heard the officer say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| that they purchased the margarita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Do we have jurisdiction over alcohol sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Was it a bottled margarita or a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| I'm not sure if it was bottled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| but it says in the narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| that it was two 16-ounce frozen margaritas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| That then would come under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| if it was indeed a liquor sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| that would not come under the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| It would come under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Alcoholic Administration of the State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Officer, can you verify if that was a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| the alcohol content of that drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| I'm not sure what the content was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Still, it would be under a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| it would be under a state license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| You can buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| beers and malt liquors that are a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| that still fall underneath our jurisdiction, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| That is correct, and without that knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| I don't, I couldn't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| when the COVID happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| that the alcoholic beverages were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| able to be sold to-go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| so I'm thinking that's, that might be what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| if they're to-go beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Mr. Chairman, can I make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| to postpone this 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| until we can get the actual product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| And if Deputy Cole, if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| we'll defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| I'm assuming if they pass this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I'm assuming if they pass this motion to defer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| you can find that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| and it might be that Lieutenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Mason might be back next week, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| He's on vacation next month meeting, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Well, then I guess it's all on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| It's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Mr. Cobain, do you understand what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Okay, we're trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| if this is something that would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| come before us or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1330)|
| 0:22:10| and we want to make sure we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| So we have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Do you want to jump in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Commissioner, just going to make a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Let me do the motion in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| and then we'll have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| So there's a motion by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Sir, do you know what the drink was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| The drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Yes, was it a poured drink from a bottle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| It was, no, it was a frozen margarita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| It was a 16-ounce frozen margarita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Like an open, I mean, an open regular margarita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| not a to-go container?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| No, it was a 16-ounce cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| A cup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1364)|
| 0:22:44| But it was with the lid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Let me ask you this simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Did your bartender pour and mix and freeze the drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| or did it come pre-packaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Well, we mixed it right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| but it was already on the margarita machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| So he just poured it from the margarita machine, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| When you made the margarita in the margarita machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| did you pour liquor in the margarita machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Commissioner Skinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Could you make sure you have his contact information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Because if this is not under our jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| there's no reason for him to come next month then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| even though we're delaying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Yeah, I can make sure that we've got the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Because that may be alcohol beverage control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| So we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| to postpone until the next beer board meeting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Okay, it is postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| and the Sheriff's Department will be in contact with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| about whether you come back here or go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1421)|
| 0:23:41| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1421)|

| 0:26:49| The state actually told me, since we're under 8%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| that there's a different program that we had to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| Can you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| I'm sorry, it's hard to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| When I spoke with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| since we don't sell any gravity beers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| how they related to me, anything 8% or below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| that there was no requirement on their side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| but there was a specific class that we needed to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| that was non-gravity when I spoke to the ABC Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| That's on the state side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| That's not on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Yes, but yeah, we're gonna do anything required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1648)|

| 0:27:48| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Beer board inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| That's you, so nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| No, sorry, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1673)|
| 0:27:53| Okay, codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Pending certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Pending certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| All right, I'll turn it over to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| to deal with all these other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Okay, I also have a note from the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| that says also need a Knox County business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| That's all been, I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I went to Farragut Courthouse last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| and had the address changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| So there was an issue with the address originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| and I've made that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| They still need it at the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| before they're gonna give you any kind of beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| So if you have a copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| you could give it to them tonight, or you could look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| I have two lights out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1714)|

| 0:28:49| You're probably a ways from moving in at this point, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| We're about two weeks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| We're waiting on utility infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| that should be done by the end of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| And then once that is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| we'll see a lot more progress throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1742)|

| 0:29:11| since that's really close to where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| What kind of business is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1753)|

| 0:29:33| for the community to come and hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1773)|

| 0:29:38| coming in with Food City on the left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1778)|

| 0:29:50| at this address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Okay, and then I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Why would you have gone to the Fairgate Town Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| I was, that was where I was close to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1798)|

| 0:30:10| So you'll be selling beer from a permanent location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| on the premises, and then, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| each food truck has its own permit and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| You're just inviting them in for the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| but you're gonna be the alcohol sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| for sort of everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1821)|

| 0:30:23| Yeah, we will control all beverage sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| and then the food trucks will lease space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| on a rotational basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=1829)|

| 0:38:08| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| I guess I just have some questions of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| I guess this is a campground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| And you have a store within the campground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| A market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Would you like me to elaborate on what the whole business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| entails and the components?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| I want to make sure you said it was off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| I want to make sure he doesn't need an on-premise also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| since it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| So I appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So we lease spaces to people with RVs to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| I'm sure we're all familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Essentially, we have a small convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| It's on Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| There's not a ton of stores nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| So we want to have a convenience aspect for the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| But the convenience store is rather small in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| We sell normal convenience items, candy, drinks, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| We want to add beer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| So that's kind of the picture, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Law department, does he need on and off or just on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| No, I think he just needs off premises the way he's described it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| I understand what he's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| I've seen that at many campgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2361)|

| 0:40:30| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Commissioner Beeler, would you please lead us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| in tonight's devotional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I'm happy to welcome Dr. Jeff LeBorg to lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| our devotional this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Dr. LeBorg has pastored a number of churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| across the Southeast and has also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| been a well-traveled evangelist and conference speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| He's earned multiple degrees from Liberty University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Liberty Theological Seminary, Louisiana Baptist Theological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Seminary, and Emmanuel Baptist Theological Seminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| He likes to go to school, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| doing some postgraduate work at Southern Baptist Theological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Seminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Most importantly, he is the lead pastor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| at Fairview Baptist Church in the heart of the Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| He is also my friend, my pastor, and my boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Pastor Jeff, the floor is yours, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner, and to our esteemed panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| of commissioners, and to all our guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you for the privilege to greet you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| If I were presenting a theological treatise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| or a sermon, or perhaps a academic paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| the theme certainly would be captured in one word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| the word appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| There's a young lad by the name of David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| We know him well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Wee little David, who defeated the giant, five small stones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| up against insurmountable odds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| David has an unimpressive resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| He's obscure, on the backside of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| But while he is being groomed lonely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| tending his father's sheep, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| something developing inside of him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| a character that creates an ability that, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| it comes his time, he's going to rise to the occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| appreciation would be the word we're looking for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| In fact, the commentary from the scripture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| simply says it this way, that with an upright heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| he shepherded them and guided them with a skillful hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| a heart that knew his people, a hand that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| able to guide in turbulent times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| So let me say it this way, in a word of appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Everything rises and falls on leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| We know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| It's not news to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Your leadership, in unprecedented days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| has rippled across our community, our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| and our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| And while others languished with ambiguity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| when some communities had no direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| this panel set the course and stayed the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| In fact, in just a few moments, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| going to recognize two stellar teams from our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| Austin East and Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| They had good leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Leaders that took them to places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| that even their athletes didn't know they possessed the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| It's because they looked beyond the immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| and saw the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| That's what we elect you to do every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| That's what we feel like you do every time you gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| So as a leader in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| on the spiritual side, I'll stop by here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| We appreciate your leadership, your insight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| and oftentimes for that which is overlooked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| you see what we cannot see and lead us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| to where we would not have gone because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| of the uprightness of heart and the skillfulness of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| In fact, if I could summarize it this way, in politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| you know things are always vacillating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| It's hard to get a definitive answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Harry Truman is purported to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| said that when he was asked about his selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| for an economist, he said, I want a one armed man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| The media stunned, said, Mr. President,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| what does a one armed man have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| with being a good economist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| He said, because I'm tired of hearing in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| On one hand, we could, but on the other hand, we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| We need a one armed man that knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| exactly what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| We're glad to say, as citizens of this great community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| thank you for being those who give clear direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| with an upright heart and a skillful hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Let's pray together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Father, thank you for good leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Thank you, Father, that in dark days of uncertainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| you have placed men and women on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| You've given us, God, leaders who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| with an upright heart and a skillful hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| have navigated some uncharted waters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2701)|

| 0:48:59| As a lifetime and lifelong athlete myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| I understand what goes into winning at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2944)|

| 0:49:20| but on the practice field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| As mayor of Knox County, I've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2963)|

| 0:49:40| And I think that's especially true of the Austin East men's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=2980)|

| 1:12:17| Thank you very much, and welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| It's a presentation by Mike Odom, president of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| Welcome, Mr. Odom. If you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, number 201, Knoxville, Tennessee, 379202,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| which I just had to look up because I didn't know our address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| So thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| I appreciate a couple minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| I promise you I will be brief because the minute I walk out of here, I'm on vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| so the faster I can get through this, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Just got to give you an update on some of the things we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| Two of our recent economic development project wins, CGI, which you all had a very big role in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| has hired about 10% to 30 of their people already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| and will be moving into their temporary space, Summer Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| which they will be leasing from you all next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| LSI, another project of ours that you helped us with, they also have hired 30 people of the 265| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| that they have committed to bringing to Knoxville or hiring here as part of their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| In our pipeline, we currently have about 83 projects, 20% of which are expansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| So those are businesses here that we're working with, trying to help them expand, grow their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| As we all have told you, that is our bigger key now versus attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| Those 83 projects have over 11,000 jobs associated with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| and about $1.6 billion in capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| So we're really working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| We have been targeting, from our business attraction perspective, Southern California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| There's a lot of companies who want to get out of California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| You can imagine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| And the ones we're targeting really fit with what we're trying to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| especially with the assets we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| A couple other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Our county unemployment in May was 3.5%, which is significantly down from the month before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4451)|
| 1:14:20| But our labor force in Knox County is only growing by 0.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| So the number of jobs is growing, the labor force is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| which lays as to why we developed a couple months ago the Regional Workforce Development Strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| really trying to impact that in a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Some of the things within that strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| one is to work to really build up our American Job Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| which is the real crux if you want to really impact positively workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| Accelerated learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| So we have a lot of people who need to be re-skilled into new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| TCAT, for instance, has done a great job of taking two-year programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| and accelerating them into 16-week programs, as well as internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| We talked about some of the project grad folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| We need more internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| So we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| A point that we've talked about a lot when it comes to the growth of Knox County and the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| is the fact that across the MSA in the last decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| our 25 to 54-year-olds has grown by less than one-half of a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| So in one decade, 25 to 54, so the people who fill jobs, start companies, buy homes, have kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| all of that across the spectrum has grown by about 166 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| So we're at a critical point right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| We've got to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| So what we've done is we've created a regional talent retention and attraction program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| Some of the things you all are working on related to civic furniture that we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| with the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| But we also have to align our post-secondary institutions with labor market information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| We need, again, to really help the interns that are here over the summer, want to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| And then we have some programming that we're going to do this year to try to attract people from other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| to come here to fill those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Two last things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| One is we are getting ready to release our regional access to capital strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| It remains the number one issue that small business and entrepreneurs are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| And two is we are still working on the development corporation Knox County transition into the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| So, Mr. Chairman, I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Are there any questions for Mr. Odom about the chamber or economic development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| We appreciate the update and look forward to hearing from you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Thank you very much, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Have a good vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Next presentation of the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council Annual Report by Kimberly Pettigrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4603)|
| 1:16:53| Welcome to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| If you would just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Can you guys hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Yeah, you just have to really talk into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| My name is Kimberly Pettigrew, 516 West Vine Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| I am the local food coordinator at Nourish Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| For the past two years, I've served as the chair of the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the council, we are a city and county mayoral appointed board with associate representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| Last March, I was also tapped by the city and county to serve as the KEMA Social Services Committee Chair for Food Access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| in partnership with Fiona McAnally from the city of Knoxville's Director of Legislative Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| While food access and food policy have not traditionally been represented under emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| we were able to use established networks among organizations involved in the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| to create a response that was focused and intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| More than 75 individuals representing both traditional and nontraditional food access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| and emergency food organizations were represented on the KEMA Food Access Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| The report you have today highlights our methods to address the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| Our response efforts prioritized open and effective communication, supporting innovation within current networks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4690)|
| 1:18:17| and bringing grassroots and at-risk voices to the table, such as Centro, Hispano, and bridge refugees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| Thanks to the decades-long work and partnership among FPC members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| the committee was able to move swiftly and cooperatively to address the ongoing food access challenges during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| and we were able to avoid some of the more dire food situations around food access that many of us viewed happening around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| You'll also see that you have a state of the food system report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| We, I guess, reignited the report in 2019, and we will continue to update this report annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| Most of the data that is in that report is data that has been gathered from federal databases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| You'll see that the news is overall good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Our food needs are declining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| Most of the access to resources is being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| The pandemic did show us that there is some additional data that shows that food needs for some populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| are shifting to smaller organizations focused on specific client bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| So one thing you'll note that is overall second harvest trends have decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| so people are not using that service as much, including during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| However, the request for things such as produce and perishable options has skyrocketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| So the need for healthy produce and perishable items was at the forefront of the pandemic response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| and the committees will continue to better assess our infrastructure and capacity to be more inclusive of the needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4779)|
| 1:19:49| The food access and food policy meetings continue to help us refine the nuances of how people access food in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| We are excited to announce that the United Way is currently hiring a director of food security systems to assist with this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| You'll see in the packet that back in 2012 was actually the last time our community did a food assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| That was in partnership with the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| So we're hoping that this position with the United Way will allow us to finally have a staff person dedicated to food access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| food policy, and food security so that we can better assess our needs and be able to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| We are really hoping to build off the momentum and partnerships that arose in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| and we're really all about creating a resilient food system, which I think we did very well during the pandemic, and we hope to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4829)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you very much. Is there any questions for Ms. Pettigrew from our commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| I had two questions, but you answered them during your presentation, so well done, and thank you for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| I was actually impressed to see that there were 38 different organizations focused on food insecurity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| and that, according to the data, we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Yeah, we're going to continue to meet, and the numbers keep growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| We're also hoping to have some calls specifically around food pantries and maybe even some regional food system planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Thank you for the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| We do not have anyone signed up, so we'll move on from that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| A couple of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=4878)|

| 1:28:07| That's 7-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Mr. Valiant will be placed into nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5288)|

| 1:28:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5300)|

| 1:28:34| and Mr. Weiner, thank you for your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5318)|
| 1:28:48| We're into the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| 42, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| Oh, that was to be added on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| I've got to keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| Item number 66, Resolution 906,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| is to amend the Knox County Commission Rules 6, Miscellaneous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5352)|
| 1:29:18| to add a new Section K entitled Civility Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| to establish a Civility Code for Agenda Work Session and Commission Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| Civility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Civility, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| I'd like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Yeah, I'd like to, before we vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| I'd like to make an addendum to Line 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| if I may refrain from behavior that threatens or attempts to disrupt Agenda Work Session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| I would like to delete the or and put in a comma where it says commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| and then comma zoning, and public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| So I think the motion would be to approve with the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| And this was emailed to everybody earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| Second by Commissioner Daly, first by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| to approve Item number 66 as amended and sent out in the previous email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Item number 69, Resolution 909,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| is amending the Knox County Commission Rules 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| by changing the title of the Rule 2 from Chair to Chair and Vice Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| and by adding a new Section D entitled Responsibilities of the Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| and a new Section E entitled Responsibilities of the Vice Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| to set forth the responsibilities of the Chair and Vice Chair of Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker, first by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| So I read the opinion, Mr. Buch, your opinion regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| and the oversight of the Commission Chair of the Merit System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| but after reading that I was still confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| because some of it mentioned the Merit System staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| but it also combined some things we had been discussing with the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| So I guess it's really who would the Director of the Merit System report to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| The Merit System Council should report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| That raised the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| Randy Smith, Commissioner Smith, said we don't want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| and I think Commissioner Buehler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| this Commission doesn't need to be in the process of administering an oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Presently, as I set out in my memo, the Merit Council responds to nobody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| and there's no oversight coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Now, this body, as I set out, can set whatever parameters need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| and Commissioner Durant, you brought up a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| when you brought in the document that says that the Ms. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5537)|
| 1:32:24| the Executive Director, is controlled by the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| but there's no connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| I don't, you know, it's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| but there's nothing in any legislation which establishes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| It's kind of, everything's kind of in a jumble right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| And that's the best I can put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| So I guess my question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| who would be, who essentially is going to give Ms. Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| or whoever else is in this position their evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| Who is going to be performing those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Would it be HR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| Normally, that would fall in the Executive Department of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| You legislate, and then she would be answering to, as she is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| under that document, to the Mayor, to the Executive Branch of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| That's usually where the oversight is, is the Executive Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| So, but right now, there's no legislation to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| But as a practical matter, what they've been doing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Ms. Taylor, who's been doing an excellent job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| as best I can, talking to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| reports to the Mayor and the Mayor evaluates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| So with, I know it was said last week, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| that our Chairman said he would not in any way be doing an evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| but as this reads, it just says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| includes the oversight of merit system for classified employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| of Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| So therein lies the issue is, who essentially is doing her evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| And if it is, in fact, the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| then I feel like maybe this sentence should be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| just because it does create that gray area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| and that potential for it to get lost along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| My understanding, when we left the conversation last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| was this outlines how it currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| I think everybody was in agreement that we ought to find it a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| under an Executive Branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| but that has yet to be codified or put into any ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| in any way, shape, and form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| And so, again, the issue or the purpose of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| was to outline where it currently sits now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| and then after our workshop and maybe through some future ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| further define what that means, but to be determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| because we haven't even dug through the basic details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| much less some of those sub-levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| So I believe that's where we kind of left it last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| was to leave it and then amend it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| Why wouldn't we just take it, remove it, and then create an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| or create an ordinance for it specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| Because it is how it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Whether we like it or not, it's been that way for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5706)|
| 1:35:14| But there's lots of lights on, so maybe we'll find a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Just to clarify, we need to create an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| to house the Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| and basically find a port for the ship and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| That we need a resolution or we need an ordinance to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| You need an ordinance because it's established by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| and as you say, and I thought it was a good analogy last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| you need to find a port for this to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| And the legislative body has the ultimate control over the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| but the legislative body shouldn't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| and I get the impression it doesn't feel like it wants the oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| which would factor in the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| Okay, so I'm telling the rest of the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| I'm fine with spearheading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| or if anybody else wants to spearhead this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| and create an ordinance next month to bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| to try to fix this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| or we can discuss it more at our special session meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| but I think this is definitely a topic we need to tackle next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| and not keep kicking the can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| I think this just needs to be fixed and over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| But I understand what Commissioner Andrette is also saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| that I don't love the language in there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| I'd rather pass this without that sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| and then next month go in there and fix this for good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| and move forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| But I also understand Chairman Jay's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| that this is currently what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| so we don't want it to be a ship in the dark either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| So I'm kind of tossed between the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| but I think I would pick to leave it out right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| and then fix it next month on a permanent basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| instead of just it's too wishy-washy for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| to leave it in there at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| I think it would be best to work on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| and bring it to the, since we're doing a whole workshop on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| anything that may come out in future things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| I mean, that's the time to do it versus while we're all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| A question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Should we postpone this then until after the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| So this way, are we in a rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Well, if somebody can enter a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| to remove that one line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| can proceed with the other things that just have to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| what is the role of the chair and the vice chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| and then add that later by specific ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| It leaves it hanging for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| but it's been hanging for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| so I don't think that much matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I want to get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| I don't want to go in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| and start moving all the different pieces around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| like just get this knocked out and take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| So the question, I think, is somebody could offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| a substitute motion to remove that one line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| if the other things are still in good form for a rule change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| versus throwing out the entire thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| that has to do with 9 or 10 other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| I agree with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| We remove the one line and move forward with our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| and we'll sort the rest of this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| From what I'm reading, from what I'm seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| there are going to need to be changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| in order to create accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| Do you want to offer that as a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| or just continue with the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Okay. Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| I'll offer it as a substitute motion if it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| before Commissioner Bigg speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| I'll offer a substitute motion that we remove that line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| and pass the rule changes as they are without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| Second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| First by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| This is a substitute motion to approve as outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| with the removal of the one line in number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| last line of number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Continued discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| is not the merit council partly under or under the mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5941)|
| 1:39:08| Here's where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| We're looking at a 50-year-old ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| and the question that was first raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| if I can give a brief history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| when Commissioner Schoonmaker asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| who did the merit council answer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| and asked Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| And Chris got up there with Marcus Kennedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| and some other people back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| and 20 minutes later he came back and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| oh, you, commission, you're in charge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| Well, that came as a surprise to everybody, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| and that started the whole conversation going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| which is where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| Ultimately, yes, you, commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| have control over the policy, procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| and everything with regard to the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| You don't have any control over how they rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| and you don't have any control over their hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| because they're quasi-judicial once something gets to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| but you have the authority to control them both budgetarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| And that was another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Nobody seemed to know who was approving the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| for the hiring and firing and all that of whatever employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| so it needs to come under some kind of control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| and you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| It does ultimately fall to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| This new ordinance needs to refer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| This commission is in charge of the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6030)|
| 1:40:38| The ordinance also, we can break down who's in control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| who they present their budgets to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| who does Paula's review every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| All that can be broke down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| and just because I don't care if we move it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| I would vote no because somehow, if it's not the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| it needs to say that the commission has oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| of the merit council somewhere, somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| Mr. Law Director, I wanted to ask you a question on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| because to me it comes down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| is it the merit council that hires and fires its director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| or is it the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| And when you say we have control over the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| is our control over them limited to what we put in an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| Because this comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| basically our ordinance was a reflection of a state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| Well, it's actually the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| State statute is a reflection on the private act that established this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| and then they copied our, well, it wasn't an ordinance back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| It was a private act, and it has since become an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| So a private act is a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| No, it's private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Back before we were a charter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| before every ordinance, as it were, had to come from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| So it applied only to Knox County as a private act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| and that's the way things were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| And any time Knox County needed anything or wanted anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| they had to go to the legislature and get a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| But now we can do it by our own power under the charter as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| So through an ordinance, we will control their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| Will we be able to control their policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Yes, you can set their policies, absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| because that ordinance sets the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| I guess what I'm asking is can we, does it have to be set in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| or can we just vote on something here to tell the mayoral council to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| I think you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| The ordinance would be your guiding light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| That's the one that establishes it and says this is what you can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| It would be kind of like the equivalent of the charter versus our commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| They may have the specific rules of how they operate their meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| and the processes and procedures kind of internally of administratively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| but we would set the ordinances as the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| Part of the problem that I found in doing all this is normally, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| let's take the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| They came up with rules that they wanted, and they submitted it to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| and you approved it, so almost every department that comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| every department I know of that comes up with rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| those rules are submitted to this commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| Now, normally this commission does a good job of referring to what that body wants, but not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6217)|
| 1:43:44| But, yeah, you would even control their rules of procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| but couldn't control what they say or how they're going to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| But you set policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| And right now under their rules that they have promulgated themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| they have total authority to create policy, all their rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| with nothing coming before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| And that's one of those things that's kind of in a flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| I think, Commissioner Smith, if I could just add, from Director Book's memo that he sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| the second answer was, yes, the commission, as the legislative branch of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| has the absolute authority over the policies, procedures, and rules of the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| However, he also said, yes, the commission does have the absolute authority to amend the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| to delegate certain authorities to the executive branch from a personnel management perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| Ultimately, we have to decide where this goes and how it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| So as of right now, there's a substitute motion on the floor to omit the last line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| and we are going to talk about this in our special called session on July 15th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| Any further discussion on item number 66?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| This is a substitute motion made by Commissioner Beeler and seconded by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Item number 66 is approved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Sorry, 69 is approved with that revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| And if there's any pending, I'll just say this, if there's questions or things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| proposals, ideas, please prep them in advance and try to send them to the, you can send them to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| I can put them all together and send them out to everybody, but July 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| we will spend an enormous amount of time digging through the four ordinances already on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| and any future ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| So please send out as much information as possible in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| Madam Clerk, next item, which one are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6353)|
| 1:46:01| We're on 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Item number 77, it's Ordinance O-21-5-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| It's amending Knox County Code Chapter 2, Article 1, entitled In General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| to add a new section 2-7 entitled Public Notices to provide for all public notices of the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| and executive branches of Knox County government to be posted on a public notice website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| that is established and maintained by the Knox County Department of Information Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| and to require a public notice that is required by law to be published in a newspaper of general circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| to be published in a non-subscription-based newspaper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| This will amend Knox County Code Chapter 2, Article 1, established in Section 2-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Second by Commissioner Ward, first by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Is there further discussion on item number 77?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Commissioner Ward was actually talking about whenever this was going to go online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| is there a specific timeline or is that more of a legislative affairs question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| So this part right here that we're doing tonight, they're going to build out the platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| and we're hoping to have it up and running in the next month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| I can ask Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| Zach, do you have him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| Hey, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Zach's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| He's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| Do we have an idea of the timeline of standing up on the website of this part that we're doing tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| If you would, maybe come to the podium and state your name and department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6460)|
| 1:47:48| Sorry, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I'm putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6470)|
| 1:47:59| That may be the hardest working man in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| This is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| Zach Webb, Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| The question is once we pass this tonight, the post, all the notifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| when do we think that website could be up and running by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| Well, that would be something I'd need to take back to my web administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| I can certainly get you an answer on that with a project timeline tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| I don't imagine the lifting to be too terribly heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| We've already mocked up some initial research on that, but I'm going to throw out a couple weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6509)|
| 1:48:36| but I would like to get a project timeline exactly back to you tomorrow if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| To answer the second part of your question, Commissioner Biggs, once they, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| the idea is that state legislation should pass more stuff this upcoming term that we'll be able to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6527)|
| 1:48:57| the rest of the notifications onto this platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| So tonight, if this passes tonight, then we'll create the platform, get it up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| explain to everybody how it's to be used and everything else, how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6545)|

| 1:49:13| we should be able to just add the other layers to that website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| So eventually, we're hoping the goal is within the next year to two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| everything should be posted up on our maintained website that we have here in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6560)|

| 1:52:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| So Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the text amendment to MUSD-EC03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| which is Carter Town Center, to allow consideration of OB, office, medical and related services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| as a recommended zone district by vote of 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Do you want to add anything as the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6755)|

| 1:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6761)|

| 1:52:45| So this amendment is an outgrowth of the initial review of the next agenda item before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| which is 4L21RZ, and the request of a sector plan amendment to O, office, which staff would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6770)|
| 1:52:57| have recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6777)|

| 1:53:04| Plan call for the Carter Town Center, excuse me, update of the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| for Carter Town Center were TC, which is town center, PC, planned commercial, and PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| planned residential, all of which are generally geared towards larger tracks of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| upwards of 8 to 20 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| Existing non-residential zones in the Carter Town Center area are comprised primarily of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| CA, PC, I, and OB, and existing residential zone districts include agricultural, planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| residential, and RB zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| This limits the properties that can be realistically be rezoned in the Carter Town Center area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| If you all have looked at the map, you'll notice there's a wide variety of parcel sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| And with the adoption of the East Knox County Community Plan in 2017, the community reiterated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| the vision to direct development to rural crossroads and corridors so that the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| character of the area may be protected while also accommodating growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| The Four Way Inn and Carter community were identified as one of the growth centers for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| the East Knox community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| And the OB, Office Medical and Related Zone Districts, is intended to provide these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| for professional and business offices, related activities that require separate buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| and building groups surrounded by landscape yards and open areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| The intent is to provide centralized compact locations for business offices, clinics, medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| and dental offices near residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| Again, so the East County Sector Plan recognized the Carter Town Center mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| at this location, and the East Knox County Community Plan, again, reiterated that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| should be directed to this area to protect the rural character of the outlying areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| So this is one of the reasons that we recommended the addition of OB, because it does support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| a concentrated mix of office medium-density residential uses at this node that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| utilized on these smaller parcels, and it provides those additional opportunities for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6898)|

| 1:55:08| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| Ms. Adkins, if you would join us at the podium, state your name and address to the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| and speak right into the mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Thank you, Catherine Adkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| I live on 8416 Strawberry Plains Plot in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| On April 8th, the MPC approved a use-on-review for a 40-bed recovery house located at 8537 Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6925)|
| 1:55:33| and not even one person from our community stood in opposition to that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| Then two months later, on June 10th, the MPC approved a second use-on-review for another recovery house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6939)|
| 1:55:47| located at 8535 Asheville Highway, right next door to the first recovery house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6947)|
| 1:55:54| The second recovery house is why the sector plan is before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| It was created only to rezone that 8535 property so that the second recovery house could receive the type of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6960)|
| 1:56:10| it needed to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| We haven't been able to talk at the MPC meetings because it's like our voices have fallen on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6974)|
| 1:56:24| Six days before the actual meeting of the sector plan, they posted on the website, and I'm going to read this to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6984)|
| 1:56:34| whereas the Planning Commission at its regularly scheduled public meeting, hearing on May 13th, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| after consideration of the staff recommendations and testimony from those persons in support and opposed to the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7001)|
| 1:56:50| approved the amendment for the subject property as requested or amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| That was six days before the meeting even happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| We didn't stand much of a chance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| And there's a question that appears twice with these rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| Once it's on the sector plan, and another time it's on Wilma Cardin's rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| And it's a very important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| And it says, was there introductions of significant new roads or utilities that were not anticipated in the plan and make development more feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7036)|
| 1:57:27| On Wilma Cardin's request at the 8535 property, the answer was no new roads or additional utilities have been introduced in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7047)|
| 1:57:38| It was different when it was answered on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| But that answer was this area is part of the Knoxville utility service area for water and wastewater service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7065)|
| 1:57:55| Another important point I'd like to bring up is that it says that the proposed amendment shall be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7075)|
| 1:58:03| should be consistent with and not in conflict with the general plan of Knoxville, Knox County, including any of its elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7083)|
| 1:58:10| major road plans, land use plan, community facilities and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| Well, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| This is the special district of the Carter Town Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| This was intended to bring our community together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| It was intended for family businesses, shops, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7105)|
| 1:58:32| And we have now one large 40-bed drug recovery house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7112)|
| 1:58:41| They also said when they set up the special district Carter Town Zone that they said that they should work with area stakeholders to consider the town center concepts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7121)|
| 1:58:50| including a vision plan to establish the land use relationships, future roads, bicycle, pedestrian networks and connections to schools and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7130)|
| 1:59:00| And the responsibility stated that a consultant working in conjunction with Knox County MPC and area residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7140)|
| 1:59:08| And should the vision plan be acceptable to the stakeholders, MPC or a consultant can develop the new form-based zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| Well, not only has the MPC, they've refused to even listen to the area residents, they have disregarded everything that we have had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7155)|
| 1:59:24| And now they are saying that they can use their administrative judgment to bypass the Knox County zoning ordinance for standards of use on reviews for recovery houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7164)|
| 1:59:38| And it is very plain that it is being violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| Whereas the Knox County Commission finds it appropriate in the best interest of the citizens of Knox County to amend the Knox County Code as shown in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| And it's the first exhibit, 4.105 Standards for Use on Review Approval of Recovering Houses Minimum Requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7193)|
| 2:00:04| The first one, the facility shall be located so that they are not within 1,320 feet of another recovery house facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7204)|
| 2:00:15| Commissioners, these are right next door to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| This is a complete violation of what was intended when this zoning ordinance was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7219)|
| 2:00:28| Nowhere is it written in the Knox County zoning laws that the MPC can whittle away on the laws and make an administrative judgment to put two recovery houses right next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7228)|
| 2:00:48| It's within a 1,000 foot safety zone of Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| It's within a half mile of our high school, middle school, senior citizens, our library, our park, and our swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7253)|
| 2:01:03| And this is called a special town zone for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| This is right in the center of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| It's not right that they're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| It's against zoning that they're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| And if this commission approves the sector plan amendment, that is going to assure that this second recovery house gets put into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7279)|
| 2:01:34| And if that happens, we're going to have two side-by-side recovery houses, which is a complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7294)|
| 2:01:42| There is 1.74 acres on this one we're speaking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| There's a potential there for them to go back to the MPC, and they've had no trouble getting what they want up to now, and get more beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7308)|
| 2:01:57| We already got 40 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| That's a big recovery house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| Forty beds is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| We have one recovery house located right in the middle of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| Please don't allow them to use their administrative judgment to bypass the zoning laws that was actually signed by – it went on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7329)|
| 2:02:22| The Knox County Commission had it on two separate readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| It was signed by the Knox County Law Director, the mayor, and the presiding commissioner, and it's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7346)|
| 2:02:37| Can you give a – you cited a particular zone law number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| The ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee is 0-17-8-102, and it was prepared by the Knox County Law Director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7365)|
| 2:02:56| and approved as to form and correctness by the director of law and signed by Richard B. Armstrong, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| What was the date on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| And the first reading was August 28, 2017, and the second reading was September 25, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| You threw out a whole bunch of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| I'm going to ask – just hit a pause real quick and let Ms. Brooks sort of address some of the points that you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| and then we may have some questions from the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| So there were certain things that – do you want to address anything that was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| I'll just make a couple of different – a couple of clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| So the item before you is not specific to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| It's for the entire mixed-use special district, EC03, Carter Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| So the next item on your agenda is to specifically consider whether or not a rezoning is appropriate for the property at 8535 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7422)|
| 2:03:52| So I wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| So this specific text amendment is to allow consideration of OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| and all the uses that are allowed within the OB to be considered as part of the EC03 town center district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7439)|
| 2:04:08| Can you explain some of the uses for OB, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| I also wanted to just clarify that while I'm pulling this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| So the six days prior, that's when we post our staff recommendations to our website for public view in advance of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7457)|
| 2:04:27| So no decision has been made at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| So the OB, use is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| Any use as regulated in the RB, general residential zone, except for height, which I believe the height restriction is 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| I'll double-check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Professional and business offices in which no activity is carried on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| catering to retail trade with the general public, hospital clinics, medical and dental offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| undertaking establishments and funeral homes, hotels, motels, except those containing retail sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| private clubs and lodges, art galleries, museums, business colleges, public and private schools and colleges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7496)|
| 2:05:03| commercial parking lot or garage, accessory buildings, recreational uses associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| and maintained primarily for the uses permitted above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| Let's see, what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| Demolition of landfills, less than one acre, yard sales, rummage sales, wireless communication, public safety facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7515)|
| 2:05:21| And then there are a number of uses that are allowed, but they are uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| so it does not mean that they are by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| They do have to go through additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| So child care centers, assisted living facilities, adult daycare centers, method on treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| clinic or facility, pain management clinic, and recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| That has to go through a separate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| I'm going to call on a few commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| So obviously just stick around with us here at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| Commissioner Buehler, I'll start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| I have a couple of questions for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| First, a comment, and I mean no disrespect because I do understand that this text amendment affects a larger area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7556)|
| 2:06:06| but it's pretty obvious why it's on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| It's on our agenda so that the zoning request that comes next can possibly be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7569)|
| 2:06:17| How many town center districts are there in Knox County, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but there's a number of them in each sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| I'm curious as to how many of the town center districts have recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7589)|
| 2:06:37| That's another good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| Commissioner Buehler said, and no disrespect, but you did say in your opening statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| that the zoning coming up next is the reason why you all look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| Yes, and I understand that, but one thing that we try to do at planning is take a big picture view of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| So when we are looking at these zones and whether or not office should be permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| and office would be an acceptable use in this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| but doing a plan amendment in the midst of the town center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| especially when so much planning has gone on in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| just gave us a little bit of pause and provided the opportunity for us to take a higher level look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| and to consider did we miss adding a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| It didn't specifically mean that the next case, that that was the rationale for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7655)|
| 2:07:41| and it doesn't mean that it's an automatic approval either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| It does take additional review and consideration by the planning commission and this board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7664)|
| 2:07:53| Do the other town centers have OP zones within them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| That's a good question. I can look into that and get back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| I don't know off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| What are some uses that there is no zoning in the town center that would prohibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7684)|
| 2:08:12| I'm not looking at this particular zoning issue with this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| What I'm looking at is, is there no ability to have a regular doctor's office in this town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7697)|
| 2:08:23| without this sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| You could as part of the planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| Put that in PC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Amy, I noticed this one and this first one I think I can never remember is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| this sector plan change is a request of Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| Why is Knox County Planning usually the next two to three that we got is from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| or the owner of the property? What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| From time to time we do recommend text amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| based on things that we see that have been possibly overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| In the planning effort it's not unusual for, you know, we have a lot of plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| and a lot of things have changed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| And in particular when you, yeah, so it's not, we don't do it frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| but it is something that does happen from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7761)|
| 2:09:28| We could approve the town center sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7768)|
| 2:09:36| but then on the next item, 79, refuse the medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| If we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| You could also deny this and, yeah, so I mean, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7785)|
| 2:09:54| I'm having a lot of heartburn. You and I talked today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| I'm having a lot of heartburn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| Especially with two recovery houses next door to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| And I see, which one went for use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Is this the one that went for use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| Or the very first one had to go for use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| That is correct. And our understanding is they are, they're one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7815)|
| 2:10:21| Two use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| They will require two use on, a reuse on, but for both properties, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| But they are associated with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| They're the same, under the same operations, my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| So we approved 78, 79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| 79 would have to go back for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| Again, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| So, let me read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| I think I heard in some way that the use on review happened before coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| No, we don't hear use on review. Use on review is only available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| No, I know, but I think it happened before it got to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| It's in a different order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| But it's on the prior piece, or is it on this piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| This one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| It's on this, okay, that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| Was it on the prior, or is it on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| So they approved use on review without having really the authorization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| in my opinion, authorization to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| It would all be pending final approval of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| So it doesn't mean, they cannot go pull building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| You know, to have the Carter Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| I think this is a great opportunity for your community out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| because town centers have worked in other areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| But to make the folks think that they're getting something special here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| and then the focal point of the new Carter Town Center is going to be recovery homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| that doesn't make any sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| I mean, this is supposed to be commercial, residential, you know, restaurants, the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| And I just think you guys got off track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| And I certainly can't support this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7935)|
| 2:12:22| I had a couple of questions, if it's okay, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| Can you address what was mentioned about the 1320-foot rule from the nearest recovery house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7949)|
| 2:12:39| As Atkins talked about, within our zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| that recovery houses had to be a certain distance away from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| I think you mentioned 1320 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7966)|
| 2:12:55| Yes, so it's section 4.105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| Do not allow two facilities to be located closer than 1320 feet to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| So it would not be possible to operate two separate recovery facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| on these two properties without violating zoning standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| This is the same owner, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| So it's one facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| I have a technical question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| Yeah, I have another question, but go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| Then I'm going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| John, I think you and I were on the commission back when we passed this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| And if I'm not mistaken, I think this stemmed from Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8014)|
| 2:13:41| And I think that 1320, when they wrote the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| they looked at the existing distance between any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| and they weren't going to make it any shorter than they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| I think that's where that number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| Are you talking about North Shore Town Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| There's the recovery on Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| There's a recovery facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| It's in your district, right over the line from mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| And they made the rule originally based off of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| So in the planning staffs, you're looking at this as one facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| because it's one operator, not two separate facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| And then also it was noted that there's a thousand foot rule from an educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8066)|
| 2:14:33| I want to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| Would this fall within that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| I have to draw it out on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| I don't have that reference handy with me of what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| I'm going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Is it okay to go around the horn or do you want to jump in on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| I don't mind, but if the chair will allow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| I would like for Mr. Andrews to be able to speak for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| because he represents the Robles Ferry Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| who also has an interest in this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| I would be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8110)|
