| 2:30:33| Mr. Chairman, can I ask the applicant a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| Most of this land is already zoned Planned Commercial and a little bit is agriculture and a little bit is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| Is it your notion that the use of the property will access to Kingston Pike rather than that basic subdivision street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9048)|
| 2:30:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| We have actually done a feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| Hang on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Let me interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| I need to get your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| I'm Jim Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| I'm with Falconer Design Company, 462 Chambliss Avenue, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| So the access basically will be from Kingston Pike rather than the subdivision road, though it touches that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:19| I believe that we had in the feasibility study had shown an access from both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| but I believe that we intended our primary access to be off of Farlow Drive, which is off of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9085)|
| 2:31:32| Directly next to Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| Farlow next to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| I have our feasibility study here if you'd like to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:47| This, of course, goes back many, many years, 20, 30 years or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| For that, I notice there's no opposition registered for this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| I didn't see any registered opposition in the minutes or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| Not that I'm aware of, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9123)|
| 2:32:11| Hearing none, were both of them read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9134)|
| 2:32:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| I'll go ahead and move per MPC recommendation on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9137)|

| 2:33:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| I believe Mr. Campbell, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| I think this property has been sold or the option didn't go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=9195)|
