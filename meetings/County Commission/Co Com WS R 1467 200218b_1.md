| 2:30:06| by the AG, or if we get new legislation that allows us to do that, I think we need to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9006)|
| 2:30:13| at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| And whether or not it's, you know, this budget year, I don't think it'll be this budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| I don't think it's feasible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| But I think that we need to start a plan, a ball rolling, if we're going to be serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Because, you know, we can't continue building schools at the pace that we're building schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| and not building the infrastructure around it and continue to put, you know, houses spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| all over a farm whenever you could have put it in one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| And so we had an opportunity to do that, and this commission failed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| And I think that lack of vision is probably going to drive us to have to change trains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9047)|
| 2:30:53| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| My question is for Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| Could you just explain the physical structure of MPC now and then what it might look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9064)|
| 2:31:10| especially, you know, since everything in the city is in the county, but obviously not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| the other way around, and just how it might functionally look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| Well, I think that it, let's just say you've got two options, I think, that you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| an option of allowing the county appointees to vote on county issues, but, you know, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9083)|
| 2:31:32| you flip that, the city appointees are county residents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| But right now, the county or the city and the town of Farragut have more influence than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| they should have on the decisions that affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| And so I think you could, or the city could contract with MPC and we could either have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| our own planning office or have our own planning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| I mean, I think there's multiple options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| And I think it would take some time to separate some of the plans, or do we just incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| our general plan until something else is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| I mean, there's a lot of things to go through there, and it's not going to happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| But we've got to stop letting the other two entities in the county dictate how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9132)|
| 2:32:18| grow into our rural area, because we're ruining our rural area by doing it the way we've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9138)|
| 2:32:23| been doing it, and not having some master plans for community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| You know, a North Shore Town Center can't happen in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| We won't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| We voted against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| It won't happen in Harbison's Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| We voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| Could you imagine if there was a town center in Harbison's Crossroads where everybody could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| walk to their respective schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| It'd make a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9164)|
| 2:32:45| And I think people would buy into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| But we can't replicate North Shore Town Center because this commission says we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| So you just want three houses to an acre everywhere all over the county, and put the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| in the schools to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| And then you're going to cost a lot of money later on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| I just think we need to look at the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| Commissioner Dray, is there any additional questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9183)|
| 2:33:09| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9193)|
| 2:33:20| Fifty-five is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| Fifty-five, for those of you who may have been following the agenda, Dr. Buchanan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| under the weather tonight, so she'll be here at the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| She's also going to, during her time, either during that update or perhaps during public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| forum, do a coronavirus update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| So, not that we have a problem with it here in Knox County, but it seemed like a relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| subject matter to update the commission on and the general public through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9224)|
| 2:33:51| And fifty-seven will be moved to Monday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| We had one gentleman who expressed, I remember we had said Randall Hendry had called in earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| Meeting is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=9247)|
