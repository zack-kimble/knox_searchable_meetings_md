| 0:01:47| anything like that if you'll step out of the room to do so. Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| requested changes to the agenda? All in favor? Aye. Motion passes. Dr. Isak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=111)|

| 0:02:11| chance to provide some updates. I'd like to begin by congratulating KCS seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| from the class of 2024 who graduated last month. Celeste is in the crowd. I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| to hand you your diploma. That was pretty cool. That was fun. I enjoyed doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| that. I was like I know you in the middle of the rain but we're not gonna talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| about the beard and rain right? We just pushed on through. I had the privilege of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| attending 19 commencement celebrations and I know many of the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| were able to participate as well. I was encouraged to see many graduates, families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| and friends celebrating together and I'm grateful for all the work that went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| these ceremonies. I also want to highlight some statistics from the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| of 2024 this year. We had more than 4,300 students graduate from KCS high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| schools. A lot of handshaking. That was awesome though. Combined these students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| had more than 187 million dollars in scholarships. That's I know several of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| those and again a lot of you were there. A lot of those were records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| for a lot of the schools that we were at. More than a hundred students committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| to serve in some form of military service and that was kind of a neat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| thing to see. I think all of our classes showed or recognized the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| serving in the military as well as industry certifications. I was glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| see that happen. A lot of people did that as well as scholarship recipients. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| they include enlistment in ROTC scholarships, appointments to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| academies and service in the Guard or Reserves. And so again I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| congratulations to the class of 2024. As always it's inspiring to see countless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| educators who attend these ceremonies to celebrate their students. That wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| be one of my favorite things to see. A lot of our schools continue to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| like walk back to their elementary schools to be able to thank those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| teachers too. I think this is really a great sign that really is a 13 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| sometimes post that if they're pre-k students of ours as well commitment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| it's great to see that you know all of our faculties get to enjoy in that. Over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| the last two weeks I also heard me students give shout outs to adults who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| influence their lives. It's kind of fun to hear those speeches what they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| with that. It was common to see students giving fist bumps, giving hugs, high fives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| to principals at the ceremonies. Those are neat moments too. We often mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| the importance of relationships in K-12 education and graduation is always a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| great reminder of the important role our educators play in the lives of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| students. So congratulations again to those seniors. I also want to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| moment to recognize the student-athletes who won state championships this year or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| placed in the runners-up category. We actually had quite a few as we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| seeing them kind of roll in from spring. I reached out to Dr. Wilson, reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| to Brian Brown too and I was like you know we had quite a few in the fall and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| in the winter too and what was kind of neat is it was spread out for schools. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| had a majority of the schools at the high school. So just to go over the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| that won state championships or were runners-up this year. So West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| football, Bearden High School soccer, Farragut Boys cross-country, Fulton Boys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| basketball, South Oil Boys soccer, Bearden Boys soccer, Gibbs softball, Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| Baseball, Bearden Dance, Farragut Dance and Halls Dance and I think wasn't there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| did Bearden Boys oh it does say Bearden Boys my fault I can't read okay yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Bearden Boys on there as well all right. So that way yeah that was I mean that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| quite almost every school had a state champ or runner-up which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| impressive and I just want to say this too to Brian Brown he's not in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| but I know that was kind of intentional thing for us to focus on making sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| had everything even at the district level to support the schools to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| done and he's done a tremendous job. He actually won't say this but he attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| every spring championship made the trips back and forth to get that done so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| really appreciate his support there. Before I wrap up I want to take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| to share that we've begun notifying employees of their placement on the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| salary schedules that you all approved earlier this year. This has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| tremendous undertaking from the business and talent team and I appreciate their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| efforts to get this completed in a short period of time. According to Evergreen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| which is the organization that we partnered with no district our size has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| ever overhauled their salary schedule in a single year and as I stated before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| firmly believe that prioritizing our KCS team members is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| With that being said as you know more than 9,000 employees at KCS we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| recognized from the beginning of this process that we're there were bound to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| be some challenges. The business and talent team has been diligent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| thinking through that process and addressing questions staff have you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=384)|

| 0:06:31| over in the symbol garden to give you guys an update. I appreciate their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| proactiveness and thinking about designing something like a form that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| not a reaction to salaries going out on Friday that was something they did on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| the front side to say please give us input we know this is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| something that happens that could there could be questions on. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| appreciate that this is May or just one May when they sent those out the salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| actually don't change to July and August so that gives us time to to improve on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| any situations that need to be improved on and also I want to say you know I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=419)|

| 0:07:09| us for that and thank you all as the board for investing in people. So in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| end if there are issues we're going to work those out but for most people I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| think we're in good shape and headed in the right direction and with that I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| like to turn it over to Miss Himmelgarn and then I'll be finished to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| guys an update on that process from Friday. Thank you Dr. Reiswick. Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| Chair Mr. Triplett and members of the board we're excited to share like Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Reiswick said that we have begun the notify individual notifications of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| salary for the 24-25 school year. The majority of those went out on Friday May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| 31st with the remainder to hopefully go out this Friday with with one small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| caveat that we still are waiting on final approval from the state of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| consolidated federal funds application so the the remaining notifications of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| employees in those positions will be contingent on that approval but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| hopefully this Friday or next if not this Friday. Like Dr. Reiswick also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| shared we have created a dedicated email address salary at Knox schools org and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| also a Google form for employees to request clarification on the process or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| alert us to something that might not have been considered in the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| and placement on the new grade bands. We did anticipate that there would be room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| to grow in this transition because it is it's a lot of employees nearly 9,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| and we're also doing it in a relatively short period of time so we we expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| that there would be some feedback that would cause us to provide clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| and in many cases cause us to provide corrections as well so we we expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| and are excited to have received a little over 700 responses to that Google| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| form since we sent it out on Friday and those responses fall into a variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| categories. Clarification on the process, consideration of step placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| verification of degrees, some employee we've given the employees a pathway to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| upload degree verification if they're if they're moving to a new degree schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| next year as well if they've attained a degree or are going to at the close of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| this semester. So excited about all of the responses and the opportunities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| engage with those employees. We will ask for a little bit of grace and patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| in that process with the 700 we do intend to respond to everyone but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| will take us a little time to do so and like Dr. Roswick said that's why that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| why the notifications came May 31st and then through the next week or two so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| that we have time to engage with the employees and provide clarifications and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=576)|

| 0:10:20| the teacher scale and then all other employees on the general scale. And for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| the teacher scale we've received a lot less questions there because it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=624)|

| 0:10:33| district. It's just step as a teacher plus one in the transition. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| transition on the general scale is using what's called class year parity which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| a little more situation and employee specific. It's either number of years in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=644)|

| 0:10:54| higher because as we said to the board our commitment has been that no one will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| go backwards in salary in this transition. So it's a the the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=658)|

| 0:11:23| employees and encourage employees to continue using those avenues so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| can provide clarification and corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Ms. Owen. Thank you Mr. Vice Chair. Is now an appropriate time to discuss that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| whole salary situation or is there a better time in the agenda? I don't know that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| have a spot in the agenda other than this so I think this is as good as any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| Thank you. So looking at the tutorial video that that our employees have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| looked at I think it's not at all clear that they are supposed to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=717)|
| 0:12:05| either number of years or their current salary. I'm also not convinced that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| is an accurate way to look at market value. If I were on the very front end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=732)|
| 0:12:23| this and not at all where we are now, I would assume that finding someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| market value would be looking at their years experience, their current step, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| finding the market value for that spot and then filling that in. And that seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| to be what the tutorial video also shows. It very clearly shows our employees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| go and find their step and then go up one. But that's not at all what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| being told right now. Repeatedly throughout the meetings, and I've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| back and watched them this week, we were told again and again no one would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| backwards. The words in salary were not part of that. It was no one will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| backwards. So our employees don't understand why they've gone backwards. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| don't understand why they've gone backwards. I understand the rationale for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| why they've gone backwards. I don't understand why that wasn't told on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| front end. In some meetings, I recall Mr. Bolton was going through and did give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=804)|
| 0:13:34| disclaimer that there are some people who were currently above market value. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| would assume that that would be a small number based on the way it was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| to us. But a small number of people is not what I've heard from over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| weekend. I've heard from an incredible number of people who are incredibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| unhappy, who have already applied for other jobs, and whose situations I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=834)|
| 0:14:02| even figure out how they would make sense to anybody. People who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| given credit to come to Knox County. Maybe they had nine years in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| industry. They were given credit for that nine years as an incentive to come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Knox County, and now those years have been taken away. And they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| understand why. I don't either. If you were incentivized to come here and given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| your years experience, I would think that would stay. I've talked to a person who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| earned a master's degree, who was given credit for that master's degree, who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| been earning additional money for that master's degree, and has now been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| yeah, we're not going to count that master's degree anymore. That seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| incredibly wrong to me. I've talked to people who have told me that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| an incredible number of years that they've taught or worked in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| position. Some of them well over 25 that they've been in their position, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| other people in the same position are at a different step than they are, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| don't understand that. I've heard from a lot of people at the very bottom of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| salary scale who have been knocked from 11 expecting to move to 12, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=912)|
| 0:15:21| now down at 3 or 4, and they don't understand how that can be. I've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| heard from a lot of people who left the classroom, moved to a position downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| and so they are not necessarily a supervisory position, but they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| somewhere in that chain, and they are at a higher position than they were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| They are now working more days, and their hourly is less than if they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| stayed where they were. So they have more days, more responsibility, a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| title, and their hourly rate is now less than had they stayed in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| I'm hearing that from some school-level administrators. I'm hearing that from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=963)|
| 0:16:12| some folks in central office. I'm hearing that from multiple people across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| the scale. I've also heard from some people who have relatives who work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| their same position, and so they've discussed it at length. They have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| of years in the position. They have a relative who was hired recently, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| relative is now at a higher step than they are, and they don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| They assume it's a mistake. They are really hoping it's a mistake. I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| from one person who was so distressed to learn that her raise is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| 30 bucks that she didn't even want to tell her family. When I looked up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| screen, I saw mine. Mine was very clear to me. My raise, if I were in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| would have been about $10,000. I could be real happy with that. When we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| having historical raises, that's a historical raise, but to our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| who are getting a raise of 30 bucks, they don't feel that. They feel something very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| very different right now, and I am hoping that we can find a way not just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| slightly correct that, but to move them to where they expect it to be. The steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| that they earned, they earned, so they should still be there, and that's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| expectation based on everything we've given them to this point. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1059)|
| 0:17:51| Sure. Vice Chair, Mr. Triplett, Ms. Owen, members of the board, thank you for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| and we encourage, I'm hopeful that some of those people have submitted to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| Google forum, because there likely are errors to correct. I will say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| We've discovered some today in the responses, which we expected, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| that's why we got the notifications out, and we're hopeful that together, us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| with the employees, that we'll discover all of those prior to them receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| their first paychecks. So thank you, and thank you to the employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| have continued to reach out. We did engage in the study with Evergreen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| who determined market value for us, who set the market value for us, and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| like you said, there are employees that were already closer to market value than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| others, so the increase for employees in the district is not the same. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| not as we've traditionally done increases, like a flat 4% across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| board, for example. It will look different for different categories of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| based on how close they were to market value, but we encourage employees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| continue to let us know their concerns, and you know, some will result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| corrections, and some will result in clarification on how the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| worked, and that's what some employees have asked for, is just clarification on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| how the transition has worked, but yes, we want all of those employees to reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| out, so we can make sure that we're doing this right. That's our intent, is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| pay all employees at market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Ms. Heminger, one other question. No one is going backwards in pay, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| correct? That is correct. And then, I know that 700 responses is a lot. It takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| time to go through. Obviously, when you mess with people's pay in any way, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| you know, it's concerning. People get anxious if it doesn't come out the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| they expected. Do you have a timeline? You know, if I'm an employee, I've reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| out, I feel like it's off. Do you have a timeline where you say, okay, in three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| weeks, three months, you know, a month, like a timeline where they can say, okay, by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| this time, I should at least have an answer from you all as to what my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| issue is, and if it's resolved. Sure, so some employees, even today, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| employees do have an answer. As far as responding to all 700, our goal is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| next couple of weeks. Mr. Bolton has convened a team already to start working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| through those and respond to the ones that are quick responses as quickly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| we can, and then put priority on the employees that are paid in July next, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| that we can make sure that those issues are addressed before those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| paychecks are issued in July, and then, of course, we have some paid in August. So, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1239)|

| 0:20:49| the goal is over the next couple of weeks. Very good. Thank you. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| folks get nervous and anxious about that, and just know that, you know, this team is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| working very hard to answer all of those and get a response out. So, any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| discussion? Dr. Adams is not here, so we will do a custodial update, or are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| prepared for the custodial update as well? She's got it covered. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| Vice Chair, Mr. Triplett, members of the board, I am filling in for Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| today. We currently have 70 custodial openings with over, or no, with 51 of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| facilities fully staffed. Thank you, and then our Strategic Plan Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| update. Ms. Christie. Thank you, Mr. Triplett, and the Strategic Plan Committee met on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| May 10th to further discuss our stakeholder engagement processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Following board approval of our contract with Milan Chicago, we discussed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| methodology of feedback that will be used including surveys, in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| sessions, focus groups, and interviews, as well as what documents and resources to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| frame engagement around, such as the districts for priorities and annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| plans. The committee will reconvene, as you stated, on June 24th at 2 p.m. to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| with representatives from Milan Chicago to further finalize the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| engagement pieces. I also believe we will have more information regarding our RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| for strategic planning by that point as well, so I will keep the board informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| as we receive that information, and we may even have another contract coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| July. Thank you, Ms. Christie. Any questions or discussion? Mr. Butler. I do not have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1351)|
| 0:22:39| discussion point on that. I wanted to go back, if I could, for clarification. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| So the Naming Committee, what is the date and time for that again, please? Sure, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| is June 25th at 3.30. And will there be any opportunity for public comments or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1371)|
| 0:23:03| engagement? The last meeting, we had some folks come and discuss why they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| to name the facility after someone, so if somebody wants to come and speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| they can. And that's at 3.30. It's at 3.30. Yes, sir. Thank you. We will move on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| regular session agenda, so we will go to C. Any discussion on C, 1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1402)|
| 0:23:31| 3 or 4? 5 or 6? 7 or 8? 9 or 10? 11 or 12? 13 or 14? 15 or 16? 17 or 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1411)|
| 0:23:59| 7A? Ms. Horne, do you want to speak to that? Sure, thank you, Mr. Triplett. So, obviously, over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1439)|
| 0:24:08| the last several months, we've had several questions regarding books that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| are in school libraries and classrooms. And in addition to the concerns from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| Moms Group that we've heard from, I've heard from several people in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| with serious concerns about some of the books. And as I've stated, as other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| members of the board have stated, I don't think that books that have sexually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| explicit images should be in our schools, and particularly since these books are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| paid for with taxpayer dollars. Furthermore, the state legislature has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| amended TCA 49-6-3803 to more clearly define books that are not age-appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| for students as those books depicting sexual images. So, this amendment goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| into effect on July 1st. Typically, our board reviews new laws that go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| effect in July during our policy review meetings, but since we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| this topic multiple times over the past couple of months, I thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| probably better just to address it sooner rather than later. And again, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| amendment goes into effect July 1st. In April, the superintendent's team outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| a review process for books that are challenged at the school level, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| certainly is needed, particularly with regard to content that may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1528)|
| 0:25:36| graphic but may be in written form. And that also, that review process is also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| part of that amendment to the law. So, specifically, the books that are this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1543)|
| 0:25:54| policy specifically calls out or brings attention to books that include visual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| imagery that hopefully would be easier to identify than perhaps if you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| read a whole book and have it reviewed. So, this really is not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| response to this law being brought. This has been a conversation, or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| amendment to the law, we've been talking about this for a while, but on July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| and Mr. Dupler can speak to it further, but on July 1st, when we get to July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| these books will not be, they can't be in our schools. So, we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| deal with this sooner rather than later, in my opinion. And basically, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| current policy says that books with sexually explicit content should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| not be in our schools, but obviously we've had a lot of a lot of question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| about that. So, I think that this will help bring some clarity so that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| can more clearly understand what is and what is not appropriate for books to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| be in schools. I think that this line, this also lines up with the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| State Standards that actually call for abstinence. So, I don't think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| should have content that that is out of line with Tennessee State Standards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| and I think that I would hope that all board members would want to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| students from books that are inappropriate and not not age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| appropriate for students. So, that's my reason for bringing this now, and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you, Ms. Horne. Thank you. I appreciate you bringing that. Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| I would yield if I'd long, if the director was going to make any comments about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1660)|
| 0:27:54| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. Thank you, Reverend Butler. I mean, what I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| is that Ms. Horne and I have been talking about this since the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| has come up through the board meetings, and Ms. Horne was looking for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| language that would make it more clear for this specific type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| graphic sexual acts, and so I think we both felt like that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1698)|
| 0:28:26| suggested language on the board agenda this month is, you know, something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| librarians and administrators could look to to say, okay, well, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| very clear. Since that time, or since Ms. Horne was looking at this language, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1717)|
| 0:28:46| know, the Tennessee legislature did amend 49-6, 3803, and in my review of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1726)|
| 0:28:55| certainly I think the legislature is trying to go further than what Ms. Horne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| is suggesting here. You know, in fact, what the legislature has done is they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| referenced a lot of definitions from the criminal obscenity statute, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| haven't referenced obscenity itself. So where is this going to go ultimately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| That's, you know, that's hard to say because there's going to be some gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| area here, but certainly what Ms. Horne is talking about here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| this suggested language, there's no question that this would be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| under the new amendments to the statute. Thank you, Mr. Hubler. So I heard the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1775)|
| 0:29:47| Tennessee state standards and the Tennessee state law, and the great way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| that we're looking at it with what Ms. Horne has given us, it meets both of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| those? Is what I'm hearing you saying or not? I mean, what Ms. Horne was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1798)|
| 0:30:08| trying to do, I believe, is to make it clear that, you know, a picture, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| depiction, an image of a sex act should not be in the school library. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| she's tried to make that clear here. Certainly that's consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| existing state law. Existing state law, when it comes to sexual education, is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1825)|
| 0:30:34| favor of abstinence. So it's certainly not in favor of depicting sex acts. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| but again, if you look at the amendment to the state law that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| take effect July 1st, certainly it appears that that law is going even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| further. So do we need to go further? At policy review, I mean, certainly. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1849)|
| 0:30:59| you know, so I think your point, Reverend Butler, is could this board be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| looking at this again very soon, you know, in July or at policy review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Absolutely. And that was my thought is that, let me just be clear, I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| any of our kids to be subjected to anything that's going to cause them any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| harm whatsoever, unnecessarily or not, or on purpose or not. So I support us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1881)|
| 0:31:30| looking at this, number one, to meet our desire for our kids not to be harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| Number two is to meet state standards, state law and state standards. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| why I was wondering, why not let us make sure we get it right doing policy review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| Because the other state laws that we have to look at, we have to pass, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| to look at policy review as well. And then we also have the time to really get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| the language right so that we can not have to revisit it and constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| coming back and hitting it. I think we would do it at policy review and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| spend that quality time getting it right. Because I'm not sure how all of us feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| but I know how I feel, and I just want to make sure we get it right. And once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| get it right, our staff can carry it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| Ms. Pike. Thank you. Yeah, I was essentially going to say, very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| to Reverend Butler, it sounds like that, so am I correct that this law has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| taken effect? That's July 1st? That we will have to come back to this? That this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| will not suffice? Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| What Ms. Horn has suggested does not include all of the language in the new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| So if it doesn't include that, if we had just this, would we still have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| back and change it? Possibly. I mean, the board and the school system is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| have to follow the state law whether you change the policy or not. Well, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| typically come back and bring them back. So I would wonder what, you know, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| would be the rush to do this now, similar to what Reverend Butler was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| saying, instead of bringing it to policy review and talking about it then? Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| I certainly, you know, agree that I don't want any harm to be done to any of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| students or kids in the county, etc. And I'm curious if we are working with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2013)|
| 0:33:42| library review system, library review team, in looking at this policy, will they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| be present at policy review to be a part of this conversation? Typically, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| have policies regarding a particular topic, those that are in central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| that are involved in that are at policy review. So I would assume. Because I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| I would love to hear from some of them as to why these books are in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| and why they're chosen and all of that. I'm not a librarian or did not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| to school for education, so I'm not going to claim to have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| So is this something that we would just push to policy review? Is there some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| of timely manner where we need this to be done this week? If you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| Ms. Hornet is the one who brought it. Any particular reason why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| brought it now? Sure, yeah, I would be happy to address that. You know, for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| thing, I mean, we have been talking about this since October, November, so this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| is not a new conversation. So the reason I think that we need to address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| now versus later, and frankly, I would like to see us approve this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| first read and forego a second reading so that at least our librarians know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| that this is the policy, it highlights a change to our policy, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| if we need to go further in policy, then certainly we can do that at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| June policy review and review that in July. So that's my preference. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| think that this is an important topic. I think it's important that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| be clear on it, and I think it's important that librarians know now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| rather than pushing it down the road another four or five, six weeks, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| they're ordering books, it would be helpful for them to make sure they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| reviewing those now based on policy. I think our policy already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| includes this, but I think that obviously we need some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| clarification. So the clarification needs to be there, in my opinion, regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| the law. I was planning to bring this, you know, regardless of the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| there's an update to the statute. So for those reasons, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| would prefer that we go ahead and approve it, and you know, like I said, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| first read so that it's in policy, and then if we need to address it further on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| we can do that. Yeah, I just wondered if we need to define any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2170)|
| 0:36:18| these, or are they already defined in law? Like sex acts, sexual activity, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| any sort of specificity there, or is it just anything visual? So it's images, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2185)|
| 0:36:39| it's visual. Like one of the emails I think we all got today, they brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| kissing, as some people define that as a sexual act. Are we including that? Not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2207)|
| 0:36:56| my knowledge, no. Does that need to be put in there? Because I would also hate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| our librarians to order something thinking that they were in line with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| this, and then it would turn out to not be in line with this. Further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2225)|
| 0:37:14| clarification could be added. We could use language that calls out particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| sex acts. I don't want to do that, but I want, I do, I think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2241)|
| 0:37:34| Something, some other guidance so that, you know, our people choosing the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| are not getting in trouble. Ms. Olin. Thank you. Our policy policy is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2259)|
| 0:37:50| changes should go through policy review first, and I think that's a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| important policy because that gives us an opportunity to discuss and find a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| of things that we might not otherwise notice. For example, the change to I-211| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2282)|
| 0:38:11| is in a paragraph regarding that the director of schools will establish an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| administrative procedure, etc., etc. Any material containing images, one and one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| shall be excluded. If I am a librarian reading this paragraph, that says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| material containing images depicting a sex act shall be excluded from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| procedure. Not excluded from the library, not excluded from a school, not excluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| from being checked out. That says that we are going to go through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| process. Particular attention will be paid to addressing the suitability and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| age-appropriateness of the instructional material, but if it depicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| a sex act, that's excluded. That's what that says. So before we jump in too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2339)|
| 0:39:08| quickly to approve something, we need to be really clear about our intent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| what it actually says. If I'm an English teacher, which I am, and if I am a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| librarian, which I'm not, if I'm reading that paragraph, we're talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| administrative procedure, and we are talking about the attention being paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| to those materials, and we're saying that the ones that we consider most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| concerning are the ones that are excluded. Thank you. The fact that we even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| have to have this discussion makes me sick, to be honest with you. The fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| we are at the point in our world, our society, in our schools, that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| books are in our system, that we have to have a discussion to create a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| policy to keep them out, just seems absolutely ridiculous that we are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| having this discussion, that it's even like an option or a thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| somebody's going to put these in the school. Like, it just absolutely just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| blows my mind that we even have to have this discussion, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| making it very clear now, not waiting, Mr. Dufler can dive into the gray aspects of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| it and figure out what the law says and bring further changes if he feels that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| necessary, but I feel like this is a right move. Mr. Butler was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| Mr. Wilson, do you have something to add, if you don't mind, Mr. Butler, before...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| Yeah, just quickly, the only thing I was going to add, just from a time sense, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| librarians obviously are off contract this summer in terms of actions to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| taken and things like that, and then to normal timeline, Sarah Searle is kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| enough to text me during this, for budgeting and those sorts of things, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| usually October when they receive those budgets, so just in terms of purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| being made, librarians working over the summer to do that type of thing, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| that we're kind of in a dead period for that too, so just wanted to add that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| conversation. Thank you. Mr. Butler. Thank you. That was somewhat what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| going to ask, was what was the time frame for the librarians' duties, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| that kind of takes us back, and then also the students won't be back before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| July, and when is the policy review for July? Well, it is June 28th. Would we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2484)|
| 0:41:33| policy available for this by then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| For that long, you would already have that ready to go, even though the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| doesn't go into effect until July 1st. Okay. So I think that policy review, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| not disagreeing with the reasons that you want to bring it, and also for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| reasons that we need to have the clarity. I do agree that talking about a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| issues we talk about takes us out of our comfort zone, but we live in a world that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| you watch the news, it takes you out of your comfort zone, so I do think these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| things we have to discuss, and having the clarity, I think, is most important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| especially for those who have to do the job, so they don't have to guess whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| or second guess, or third guess themselves, so, and I think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| policy review would give us the time to make the sufficient effort to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| come up with something, and at that time, if we need to pass it on first read, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| can, but I do think we need to really spend time getting it right, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| there's not any type of questions that we have to come back and examine, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Mr. Triplett, I don't want to have this discussion again, and we've been having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| it for a while, so I think it's time for us to put it to bed, but let's put it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| bed the right way. Thank you, Mr. Butler. Ms. Owen? Thank you. I would guess that TSBA would give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2576)|
| 0:43:05| some kind of moral policy sometime in July, probably. I think we would be wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2585)|
| 0:43:13| to look at that, at least for consideration, but I also want to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| that in I-212, we have the same language issue, and I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2598)|
| 0:43:27| paraphrase a little bit, and then I'll just say the rest. If upon reconsideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| so this is the reconsideration section, if upon reconsideration the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| determined to be inappropriate for the age and maturity level of the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| etc., the school shall remove the material from student access in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| collection or grade level for which it has been deemed inappropriate. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| material containing images depicting a sex act or sexual activity shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| excluded, so shall be excluded from being removed. I think if we want this to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| what we're discussing, and if we want it to be consistent with the law, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| need to make sure that that is in a paragraph where it says what we intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| to say. Thank you. Mr. Dupler? I was just going to say, since Ms. Owen has this concern, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| the simple fix would be to add excluded from the school's collection on the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| of the sentence, and then that would remove any type of ambiguity. As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| TSBA is concerned, I don't know when they're going to come out with a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| policy, and you know, that would likely need to be, you know, worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| with them, so. Okay. Ms. Horn? Yes, thank you. I was going to actually make the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| suggestion on 211, that I think the purpose was to clarify what comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| prior to that where it says sexually explicit. You could even remove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| parenthesis, and then an add from classroom libraries and media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2698)|
| 0:45:06| centers, or whatever you just said, to make it clear. And then, and I, first of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| all, Ms. Owen, I appreciate you raising the concern, because I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| make sure that it's clear and it's correct. In 212, I think this, the added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| sentence could be moved probably up to number one, where it says whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| materials are appropriate for the age and maturity levels of the students who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| may have access. That new sentence could actually just be added to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| number one, which would make it clearer. So I can make that, so I would say we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| could make that change, but that would be much more clear. So I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| you bringing that clarity to that. Any more discussion? All right. Item 8A or B, C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2748)|
| 0:46:03| or D, E or F, 9A or B, C or D. Regular agenda items 10A or B, A. Sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2763)|
| 0:46:24| Yeah, I have a question on 10A. Let me pull that up. So sorry, I had already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2784)|
| 0:46:35| closed it. Basically that $430 million, I think, that was on the detail for special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2795)|
| 0:46:45| education. I've had several inquiries about this over the past few months, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| I know we've kind of gone back and forth. Was it million, or is it thousand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Thousand, sorry. A lot of numbers today. So it says under program designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2814)|
| 0:47:03| it's the second one, it's special education support services other 430,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| and it's special education training. Do we have any more information on exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| what that is, if that is an RFP process, what services those are, and all from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| Ms. Helmer, thank you. Vice Chair, Mr. Triplett, Ms. Byke, I'll take the first part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| and then Dr. Brown has more information. So you are correct that for the 430,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| it's in special education support services other and special education training, which is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| that we told the board back in April, the special education training. Dr. Brown has informed us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| that is an error, that should be special education outside services instead of training for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| $430,000. So that's a slight change to this fund balance designation, but I'll let Dr. Brown answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| your second question about the RFP. Dr. Brown. Ms. Byke, I just responded to your email a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| while ago giving you the answer, but that's okay. Everybody deserves the answer too. So, and I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| admit, I think there's been a lot of confusion in this process, and obviously we've batted around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| some ideas and some explanations, and I think we've hit all over it, but I talked to Dr. Lloyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| today to get clarification, because even I have probably misinformed some people. I understood it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| to be some trainings that we had, but actually that training money is coming out of our IDEA budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| which is not, this is not a part of. So this money actually is money that is a budgetary requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| and so when an IEP team meets, there are times that the team will decide that a student needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| a certain level of services. So labeling it as other services is correct. So for example, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| a child comes in and you're doing an evaluation, and the parents don't agree with the results, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| can request an independent educational evaluation. And so at that point in time that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| to pay an outside vendor to do that evaluation. That's what this money is for. Additionally, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| may, at an IEP meeting, determine that a student needs some other level of service, which is not so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| common that we would provide it internally. Like for example, we employ our own occupational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists. All of those things would be services we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| provide, but say for example, it was determined that a student needed music services or music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| therapy. We don't, that's not as common, so we don't do that. So the whole purpose of this line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| item is to ensure that we can provide the continuum of services through special education. So it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| be, you know, music therapy, it could be that independent evaluation, it could be a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| placement. We would, you know, if the team decided that those were the appropriate services for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| child's education, then we have to pay for that. So if we don't have this line item in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| then we would be predetermining that we could not provide service for a child, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| we cannot do. And again, this is not something that should be a fund balance transfer, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| will just say in the transition of me into this position, I don't know why that was neglected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| from the budget, but moving forward, this really is a budget line item that we are required to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| each and every year for that reason. We have to be able to show that we can provide services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| outside of those that we can provide internally. So that's why this, that's the reason for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| and moving forward, it should not be a fund balance transfer. Okay, so next year it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| in our general budget. Yes, it should be, and I think in previous years it probably was. The timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| this year with the transition of Mr. Myers leaving and me stepping into this position, somehow that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| fell through the cracks. So I'll take ownership because it's my budget now, but moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| this will not be a, it would not be a fund balance request. This will, this should be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| regular budget line item. Do you know how the total was come up with, the $430,000? I don't. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| can ask that. That's, the request came directly from Dr. Loy, so I would assume that it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| from previous years and, you know, looking at the potential for, you know, what is the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| things like residential placement have we historically had to pay for. Again, it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| estimate, and if this money is not spent, then it would roll back into fund balance, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| but that's, you know, that's, we have to have an amount available so that we can provide those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| services if need be. I would love to know at a future date, you know, how that total was come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3098)|
| 0:51:48| come to, and then also, I understand that there are services and all of those things that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| know, we don't employ those people on a regular basis, but are there any sort of guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| guardrails, or anything like where, like it's yes, this, but no, definitely not that. I'd love to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| know those things at some point too. Okay. Yeah, I would say that, again, the whole purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| this is just to provide the funding for whatever decision that the IEP team agrees upon. So, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| know, at that point, if the team agrees that services are needed, then this is how we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| pay for it. Okay. You know, yes, I'm sure there are limitations. We can't, you know, provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| somebody with a new car. That wouldn't be necessary, but any necessary services. I hope an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| IEP team wouldn't recommend that. Yeah, no, again, obviously, that was a extreme example. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| thank you. Yep. Ms. Hellman. Thank you. Could we get an updated document, maybe attached to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3162)|

| 0:53:58| of crazy, but that comes with a couple different celebrations this month, besides my daughter's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3238)|

| 0:54:09| the end of slavery in the United States. The name Juneteenth references the date of the holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| combining the words June and 19th. On January 1st, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3257)|

| 0:55:12| most favorite thing we get to do as board members. And then also, congratulations to all the teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240603?start=3312)|
