| 0:02:28| Okay, time now for my Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| The first two items I wanted to share with Councilmembers signify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| that for some members of our community, summer is winding down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| despite the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| It does seem to be the end of summer, particularly for kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| So first up, this is the final week for our Summer in the City program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| Twenty-one students from across our city have been taking part in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| eight-week paid program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| And this year our Summer in the City interns were placed in more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| 20 departments, worked our kid-errific events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| and even assisted with Parks and Rec's first teen-only Aspire Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| This Thursday the interns will be giving their final presentations on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| they've learned in their eight weeks with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| But if you ask me, I know we have learned just as much from them as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| have learned from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| So I invite Councilmembers to come out this Thursday at noon at the Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Works building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| It's always a fun celebration to see the city through the eyes of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| And some of them may eventually end up joining the city in the years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| So I hope you can join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Before that, we will wrap up our kid-errific series with a final celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| in World's Fair Park, and that's tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=216)|

| 0:03:42| and runs until 1 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=222)|

| 0:03:49| success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| Before we move on, I want to take a moment to recognize someone special to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=232)|

| 0:04:07| with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=247)|

| 0:04:17| Stephanie serves as the city's American with Disabilities Act coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=257)|

| 0:04:54| Finally, a quick reminder about our rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=294)|
| 0:05:05| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| forum should sign up with the city recorder, Mr. Johnson, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| And council rules state that up to three people each may speak for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| an agenda item, and right now there are a couple of agenda items where more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| than four people have spoken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| 9A has more than three people signed up to speak in favor, and so does 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| And 11B also has more than three people signed up, and 11R has four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| And so council rules say that three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| So I encourage those people, if you can huddle up before these agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| come up, I recommend that you coordinate and confirm which three speakers you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| would like to prioritize on this topic before we get to that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| Please do not use profanity, and when speaking to specific agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| Those who fail to adhere to these rules may be ruled out of order and asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| For those who are listening, please note that you may not disrupt a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| meeting from the audience, and those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Thank you in advance for respecting these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| And that concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Are there any reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| I just wanted to let everyone know that later this week Councilmember Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| will be celebrating a birthday, so I just wanted to say happy birthday in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Also, consistent with a resolution that was unanimously passed by this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| members of City Council and the Knox County Commission will be having a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| workshop on Thursday, August 3rd at 5 p.m. here in the large assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| I wanted to let you all know that we also reached out to the state delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| and members of the state delegation also wanted to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| So we'll be having them as well as we did the one we had about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| So just wanted to put that on everyone's radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| and we're looking forward to a very good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| The only other announcement I wanted to make was if you weren't aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| watching at home or here in the audience, there are city elections coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and before our next meeting on July 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| that's the final day to register to vote for the primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| So just wanted to remind everybody to take advantage of that and let your voice be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Just a shout out to the people at SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Since our last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| they opened their first energy-efficient home on Texas Avenue in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| It was attended by several people of the city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| and it's really good to have that first one done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| and hopefully there will be many more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| And they found a most appropriate residence, and the key was passed off to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| So this is all good news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| and I commend SEED and J.D. Jackson and Stan Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| and all those other folks that are doing good work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Just wanted to take a moment to recognize the passing of former county commissioner Thomas Tank Strickland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=495)|
| 0:08:23| who contributed so much to not only the city but the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| continued to serve on multiple community advisory boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| was a founder of the MLK Commission and other initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| and also was the first African-American and, to date, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| still the only African-American who has served as chair of a county commission at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| And so I just want to recognize his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| His services will be Friday from 11 to 12, the receiving of friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| and at noon, the funeral service at Overcoming Believers Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| And if we may, I'd just like for us to have a moment of silence in his memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=536)|
| 0:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| I just want to remind everybody the KTA board will meet this Thursday at 3 o'clock in this large assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| We will review the final draft network of CAT Reimagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I'm really proud of the staff and the progress they've made to incorporate 10 significant changes since the first draft network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| So there's still public comment options available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Obviously, that meeting is open to the public, and it will be, again, this room on Thursday at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| We'll move on to Item 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| 8A is a resolution approving the appointment of members to the elections, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| and the election of officers for the Mayor's Council on Disability Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Could the members of CODI please raise your hands if you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you for the incoming members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| We really appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=621)|
| 0:10:37| Okay, I can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| 9A, an ordinance, I should have brought my glasses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B Zoning Code Article 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| off-street parking to clarify when recalculation of parking is required to remove the 50% rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| which creates an undue burden on redevelopment in areas of the city with existing lower property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| and to remove Article 11.1.C, city of Knoxville applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| Is that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| A few people have signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| First is Mr. Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| You can come to the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=680)|
| 0:11:32| You need to speak closer into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Hopefully it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| This one's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Parker Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| This packet, I'm going to reference some of it during this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| I think it's important to discuss how we arrived at the 50% threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| The packet, the first ten pages of this packet is every single property in the Bearden overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| I was only able to do Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| And then there's columns that talk about some of the items that the 50% references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| and then recode actually added some more stuff to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| But as you can see, there's five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Base dimension, frontage standards, lighting, parking, and landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| I think it's important to note here that landscaping is only one piece of what we're talking about with the 50% threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| The highlighted properties are where there was either no conflicts or one conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| Any time you pull a building permit and you go over the 50%, we'd be required to bring all of these up to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| which is a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| As this was getting implemented, on page 10, you can actually flip ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| It's the one that's tabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| The percentage of parcels just in Bearden where there was only one or no conflicts is only 24%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| meaning that 75% of the buildings in just Bearden alone means that you'd have to bring all that stuff up to being once you go over the 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=780)|
| 0:13:09| If you flip to page one, you can see a property that we redeveloped right before the ordinance came into being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=789)|
| 0:13:18| So this is the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| And on the next page, you can see the build two lines setbacks that were brought into being because of landscaping or other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| And as you can see, the lines go through the building, eliminate almost all the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=809)|
| 0:13:37| And so this building was a travel agency, an aquatics store, and a butcher shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| It's now a mortgage company, a medical clinic, and a donut shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| The ordinance would have prevented that redevelopment without variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| The variance process adds cost to the owners and workload to the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| Variances should be the exception and not the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| The ordinance, the 50%, has made variances a requirement on most existing redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| In Bearden, the property owners and business owners have a fighting chance due to the mathematics of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| It's easier for higher value properties to stay under the 50% threshold when making incremental renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| In areas of town where the property values are lower, these areas include Broadway, Clinton Highway, Chapman Highway, the Magnolia Corridor, and Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=859)|
| 0:14:28| we're placing a burden on those who are less able to absorb it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| We are hurting the areas that need the most help when redeveloping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| Many parcels cannot be developed until the parcel can be purchased for land value, and this is not a healthy cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| Forcing site changes on existing buildings is a major problem, and that's what the 50% threshold does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| You're trying to renovate the interior of the building, and now you're forced to address the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| which you're trying to squeeze a round peg into a square hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| It just doesn't exist because you cannot adjust the amount of area you have on the site without making major changes to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=900)|
| 0:15:10| Since this is the second reading, some of the council members had some comments that I want to address on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| Councilwoman Parker asked if we would end up with lower quality developments, and it's not a question of quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| It's a question of being able to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| The inability to develop is the worst thing you can do for an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| The ordinance as written now creates a lesser quality development because owners or tenants stay under the 50% and do not change the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| An example of this that we're currently dealing with is the advanced auto on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| No significant changes can be made to that building without triggering the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| It is set vacant for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| The newly vacant CVS on Broadway is in the same positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| Councilman Smith, you are correct that the engineering challenges, and it's something that needs to continue to be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| The 50% threshold requirement is usually the first domino that triggers engineering and other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| Section 11.1.B.2 needs to get interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| Change of use is a domino that's early in the process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| Councilman Thomas, in your district, a school was not permitted to go into a church because this ordinance combined with change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| It's perhaps more shocking than the example of the soccer facility on Broadway that's now a cannabis store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| It's not about trees and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| This ordinance has prevented redevelopment that's needed and beneficial for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| Vice Mayor Roberto, you referenced the change of use, which is another development challenge and one that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| Both change of use and 50% threshold are damaging the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| However, change of use is a much more complex problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| 50% threshold is the low-hanging fruit that we can deal with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Mr. Bartholomew, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| The next person signed up to speak in favor of this is Amy Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| Ms. Nolan, if you could state your name and address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Amy Nolan, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| Yes, I very quickly want to reiterate the email that I sent Councilmember earlier this week and reiterate the Knoxville Chamber's support of the administration's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1035)|
| 0:17:27| This is an issue that has been cited repeatedly as a barrier to redevelopment in the past four years since the new zoning code was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1047)|
| 0:17:36| The example that Parker gave, I think you would find many in the real estate community that could give examples like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1056)|
| 0:17:46| As it stands now, the ordinance really contributes to inequity and blight in areas where the underlying property values do not support costly modifications to parking lots that are already safe and functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1066)|
| 0:18:00| And not only can the administration's proposal stimulate much-needed redevelopment of existing businesses, I want to emphasize we're talking redevelopment of existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1080)|
| 0:18:13| but it can also serve to stimulate owner-occupied small businesses and small-scale developers that are vested in their community's success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1093)|
| 0:18:23| An argument could be made by us that parking and landscape regulations remain too stringent, but the administration and hopefully the Council understand the need for compromise to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1103)|
| 0:18:35| The city is increasingly celebrated as a great place to live, work, and play, and we need to ensure that that entire community is participating in the renaissance that we all enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1115)|
| 0:18:47| For those reasons, we hope you will vote yes on 9A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Next person signed up to speak is Hanson Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| Good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Hanson Sale, East Tennessee Realtors, formerly CAR 609 Weisgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| I'm also speaking in support, and I don't want to reiterate too much of the memo that we sent to you earlier this week, but we very much support this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1149)|
| 0:19:19| This was a really good faith effort on behalf of the administration to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| It is fundamentally a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| There are things in this proposal that are alleviating development challenges, but we also added new things that will require basic landscaping in certain circumstances when we wouldn't have had that otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1165)|
| 0:19:37| This is fundamentally a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| As I said in our memo, there's a really big disparity between how much you can spend on the same building in West Knoxville versus deep into South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1179)|
| 0:19:50| It can be the same building, and we're discriminating, in effect, based solely on the value of the underlying land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| That directly creates an incentive for developers to focus on high land value areas that typically tend to be the areas that are already ripe for development that developers are already jumping to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1198)|
| 0:20:11| This is eliminating that disparity, but also compromising a bit to ensure that we continue to have good regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| I know I've heard it said that we don't want more seas of concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| I think it's important to note that is not what we are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| We are not going to get more seas of concrete from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| This is just allowing somebody who – for example, if you want to redevelop a property – I mean the practical implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| If you want to redevelop an old motel building into a 50-unit housing complex, today commercial lending is really challenging to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1239)|
| 0:20:48| It's a really, really tough economic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| It's not inconceivable that you can only get financing for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| So the practical implication of the policy now is we're going to take a step back and say, no, we love that you're going to reuse, adaptive reuse, change this into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1257)|
| 0:21:08| But yeah, the parking lot doesn't look nice enough, so yeah, we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| That's the practical implication of what the policy is now, and I think we need to look at priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| Should we prioritize reusing our vacant buildings, or should we prioritize getting it all done at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| So I think it's just lastly important to note that even some of the most important laudable policies come with tradeoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| And in this case, a policy that was designed with good intention to expedite the improvement of our parking lots has come at the expense of making it more difficult to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1295)|
| 0:21:47| Oftentimes, and most frequently in the areas most in need of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| So I guess we should ask ourselves, has perfect become the enemy of good with this particular rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| I think so, and I hope you will vote to approve the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| It's a big step forward for the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| There's one person signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| This is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Ms. Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, and I'm here tonight as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1338)|
| 0:22:28| The amendments that you have before you are commendable, and they deserve to be passed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| However, Scenic Knoxville believes that they still leave some problems unsolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| And to repeat, and for the record, we think that we need to, number one, offer relief to properties of lower value so redevelopment is not overly stymied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1359)|
| 0:22:50| while at the same time we need to require some landscaping because these same areas of the city both need and deserve increased tree canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1370)|
| 0:23:01| And two, we need to require larger properties that are more likely to be corporately owned or owned by large developers to add landscaping when they do significant renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1381)|
| 0:23:12| that don't trigger landscaping under the amendments as they are currently proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| We are, as you all know, in the midst of a global record-breaking heat wave, and one step Knoxville can take to mitigate this is to plant more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1398)|
| 0:23:28| The Advisory Committee for the Urban Forest Master Plan, of which I am a member, is strongly recommending more tree planting on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1408)|
| 0:23:38| The amendments before you, by relaxing the landscaping requirements under certain circumstances, unfortunately do the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| Several of you have expressed support for Scenic Knoxville's goals here, and we hope that you will continue to support this work and to continue to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1427)|
| 0:24:00| so we can bring back to Council modifications that are acceptable to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| I appreciate everybody's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| I'm the one that asked for this postponement because, as you know, when we talked about it four-plus weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| there was this tension between landscaping and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| Scenic Knoxville worked on an amendment, had some good things to it, but it would be not an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1470)|
| 0:24:40| It would be a total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| It would have to go back to planning, as I believe I discussed with our attorney, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| So right now what we have before us is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| I plan to support this because I do think that we need to see if it spurs development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| but I would very much like to go on the record that I would like a report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| I hope my colleagues would, too, from the administration in 15 to 18 months of what has this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| Has it made it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| And at the same time, continue to look at working with Scenic Knoxville and the Urban Landscape Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| to deal with the issues that Ms. Feld mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| But I do plan to support this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| And, Ms. Fugate, if I'm still mayor in 18 months, I will be happy to provide such a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1533)|
| 0:25:42| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I'm going to support this on second reading as well, but this is not an easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| In fact, it was quite a difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| As you weigh through this, certainly my review of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| what I see here is the need to make sure that we're equally redeveloping in all parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| And it is certainly easier to meet the 50 percent threshold when you have a higher property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| We don't want to have a disparity or to disincentivize folks from redeveloping in lower value properties right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1572)|
| 0:26:22| We need to have that happen all across our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| That is also weighed against the need for high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| And I think we do want to have high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| We're not going to get where we want to get to as a city if we don't have high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| So those are the two things that I struggled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And at the end, where I came down was that the worst of these two is not making sure we're developing equally across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1600)|
| 0:26:49| So that's why I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| What I do see, though, is that a need for having high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| And I'm glad to hear Councilmember Fugate talk about revisiting this because I think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| We want to make sure all development everywhere in the city has high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| And so what I think we might need to look at is if there's some type of an incentive program that we could use to raise that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| And I know that was mentioned as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| So I do plan on voting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And there was a lot of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| I'm sure you all have done the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I think Councilmember Smith was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| And then Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| I, too, plan to support this with some mixed emotions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| But I'll start with where I ended the last meeting with thanking Mr. Aarons for bringing this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| and recognizing a barrier to development in our community, thinking it through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| and making progress instead of being stifled by these same challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| I also just want to add, as we talk about the future changes that we might consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| is that I think parking requirements are staring us right in the face as an answer to reduce those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| Both allows for easier redevelopment requirements and also adds more green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| and takes away from the seas of concrete that Mr. Sayle referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| I think, Mr. Bartholomew, thank you for this homework, this chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| And I just look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| I think the most nos, the quick spot check, are related to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| So I think, again, reducing parking minimums or, dare I say, removing them altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| I think is something that we should really focus on and agree with my colleagues' comments around not maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| yes, a report in 18 months would be useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| but the tree canopy master plan and other bodies of work in flight should allow us to chip away even before that report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1718)|
| 0:28:47| and then another analysis and now we're two years away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| So I think there's progress to be made beyond this, but this is progress indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| And so I thank everybody for meeting in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Yes, I have a question and some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| I think it was Mr. Sayle that I most likely would want to answer this question to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| And my question has to do with we're eliminating certain requirements that ensure more, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1751)|
| 0:29:20| human-scale parking with landscaping, et cetera, like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| And that bothers me a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| But I think I heard Mr. Sayle say that there were also some additions that would come along with this as it's on the agenda right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1768)|
| 0:29:38| Yeah, I walked down here to say I don't have it in front of me, so I'm going to defer to Aaron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| I think our staff can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Ms. Gill or Peter Ahrens, I don't know if you can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| I see Peter coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| If you could address Mr. Thomas's question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Some of the concessions that we worked with Scenic Knoxville is additional interior islands at a rate requiring more of them than is currently required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1806)|
| 0:30:20| In addition, in other situations, we would require landscaping in a buffer yard that isn't necessarily the full width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| So even if you don't have that 6- or 10-foot width, as long as you have the soil capacity, we would require additional landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| So it is a true compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| We're recognizing that some existing parking lots are designed and constructed a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| and to redesign those would be a great hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| And on the flip side, in compromise, we're requiring additional landscaping in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| This really does concern me a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| There was a lot of work that was done earlier to address the problems with the parking lots with the, you know, lack of trees and ocean of concrete that we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1864)|
| 0:31:17| And, you know, we've talked about how, you know, being perfect shouldn't be the enemy of doing good, but I'm not asking for anything perfect here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1877)|
| 0:31:28| I'm just asking for improvements over what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| I'm concerned that eliminating these rules without having something else in place to shore up the other need that we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1893)|
| 0:31:48| which was the reason these rules were put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| I don't like the idea of deleting them altogether without having something else to mitigate the impact that eliminating this 50-cent rule may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1911)|
| 0:32:06| After listening to my colleagues and listening to Scenic Knoxville, I'm going to go ahead and vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| but what I'm hearing is that this is not the end of the discussion because I worry that we actually are taking a step backward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1933)|
| 0:32:27| from what previous policy makers had worked hard on and thought was a better city for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1947)|
| 0:32:38| So it bothers me that there's an elimination without something else that kind of assesses the original problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1958)|
| 0:32:50| I think I am going to, it's hard for me, I think I am going to go ahead and vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| but this is with the understanding that I want the door left open to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| I want Scenic Knoxville involved again in line with Councilperson Fugate's idea about we really need a review of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1982)|
| 0:33:15| and see how it's working and have these parties to discuss it because it's not a small item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| It has to do with quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| The other thing, we're talking about economic development in areas that may be unfairly impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2007)|
| 0:33:36| but I think it goes without saying those areas also deserve as good a guidelines and landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2016)|
| 0:33:48| and heat reduction that any other place in the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| So those are the things that we need to weigh out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| We need to make sure that even if we are allowing more economic development or encouraging it in places that don't have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| that we also ensure that they have proper guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Councilmember Ryder, then Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| So I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| First off, I want to say I appreciate Scenic Knoxville, Ms. Feld, and Mr. Earns' work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| And Ms. Feld has proposed some good ideas to look at maybe getting more tree canopy in the areas where we have these underdeveloped properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2065)|
| 0:34:33| because that's really kind of the crux of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| We have parts of town where you just don't have vacant properties, and you have parts of town where you have vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| And Councilman Thomas and I are very familiar with Broadway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| We've spent a lot of time before we were on council working on some of the problems we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| We have the old Kroger that's not moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| We've got the old Kmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| We've got the old Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Now we've got the old CVS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| We have the old SunTrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| The first Tennessee is going to become a cookout, which is a change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| So they're going to completely tear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| This is not about landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| They're going to completely tear out the entire, all the driveways, all of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| Not landscaping, all the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| That is really what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| But with the change of use, they still have to comply with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| So I think what's important to know is that this ordinance change is only addressing a few small things, low-hanging fruit, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2124)|
| 0:35:35| We've had properties on the Broadway Corridor where landlords have turned away change of use because of all the parking lot changes it triggers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2135)|
| 0:35:47| They'd have to tear out the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| They'd have to tear out the existing islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| They'd have to tear out the existing lanes and rebuild entire parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| That's a lot of waste and landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| And they'd rather sit around and wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| If they bought the property on the cheap, they'd rather sit around and wait for a same use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| So when we talk about the CVS property, what's the likelihood that it's going to become a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| It's going to be retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Maybe we'll get another cannabis CBD store because that's what happened with the paint store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| It had to be retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| The after-school youth program had to leave because they were going to have to tear out all of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| Ms. Feld came up and Scenic Knoxville came up with some potential amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| I think the thing is, is in going through some of those amendments, like to do it by size, when we went and measured your McDonald's, your Wendy's, your Sonic's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2198)|
| 0:36:49| they all fell well below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| And so that wasn't an equitable way to do it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| If we were trying to say your chains with your deep pockets, they were all going to get by and not be able to do it with the potential amendments of dividing it by 10,000 and 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2214)|
| 0:37:06| So I feel like we can keep working on this outside of passing what we passed tonight and come up with a different way to get more tree canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| whether that be changes in the tree ordinance or changes in Section 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| But I think this is going to allow a few things to actually happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| And there's just been some small business, local local businesses that have really struggled to even make their projects happen because of change of use, which we're not even addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2244)|
| 0:37:35| And I don't know what all that entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I'm not going to take you down that path tonight, but I appreciate Mr. Bartholomew bringing it up because that's where we've lost several leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2257)|
| 0:37:46| In fact, one of them was a pretty nice, good employer that was going to come to Broadway and a building that I know we would all been excited to see them come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2266)|
| 0:37:56| But the change of use was going to trigger a lot of really expensive parking lot changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| And so the landlord was like, no, not interested in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| So, you know, I want to see some of these vacant properties in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| And I'm not saying that we have to have low standards, but we have to have some reasonable way that there's equity in developing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2291)|
| 0:38:21| And what we had on the books was not getting us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| So I'm fine with going and trying to figure out a way to address the tree canopy through some other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Seeing no lights on, we'll move forward to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code to Penixby Zoning Code at Articles 12.5 and 12.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| Parking Lot Perimeter Landscape Yard and Interior Parking Lot Landscape Yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2334)|

| 0:45:25| whether to allow duplexes in the R-N-2 zone by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I want to commend the administration and council for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| their work on affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| That work has primarily involved tax abatements and cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| deductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| And efforts really to push the private market to create more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| affordable rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| This resolution I think really is intended to allow the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| to create more housing without those incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| It removes the barrier of making it a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Duplexes are increasingly attractive housing option for both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| young professionals and senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| They are not a silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| But they do represent an attractive and an affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| option between apartments and single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| We call that housing mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| And it is intrinsically tied to economic mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| And when we talk to young professionals, we have a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| called Home Sweet Career where we go on campuses and talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| younger professionals about making their home in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| That issue of housing mobility is top of mind for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| And ironically, what's also top of mind for them is can their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| parents move here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Will their parents have a place to live here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| Which I think is really kind of one of this interest in being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| communal is, again, something that has happened after pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| But it's a question that we get a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Duplexes really fill a niche there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| My understanding is, and Director Brooks will correct me if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| wrong, that there's been about two dozen requests for duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| in the R and 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| And all have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| What we don't know is how many applications were not filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| because the property owner did not want to spend the hundreds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| dollars and months on something with the risk of being rejected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| and having nothing to show for their time or money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| I know we can't answer there's going to be lots of what ifs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| And we can't answer all those what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| But the planning commission and making this a priority for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| planning commission will allow us the time to consider some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| those what ifs and really have a create, remove the barriers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| allow the private market to create the kind of housing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| people of all ages are asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2872)|

| 0:48:09| I am also speaking in support of this resolution on behalf of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| I've sort of wavered on what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| We've talked a lot about how to address the housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| We talk a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| We don't do a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| We've heard, I've given you plenty of stats that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| rents are $450 more expensive than they were two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| Home prices are upwards of 40% higher than they were pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| We say it over and over, but we don't do all that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| And this is a really easy, and I can't overstate enough, a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| very small change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| R and 2 represents only 20% of residentially zoned land in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| city, so 80% of neighborhoods would not be affected were we to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| remove this requirement, and most are already built out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| wouldn't be affected anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| It's also important to know who lives in attached housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| I did some analysis of census data this morning, and a sizable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| majority of those living in attached housing are either young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| professionals, 25 to 35, or seniors, 65 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| And the second most common form of housing for seniors in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| city of people living in Knoxville is attached housing duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| So duplexes solve two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| They create affordable both home ownership and rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| opportunities in neighborhoods where someone might not be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| to afford a home, but they can afford half of the duplex, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| rent or the home ownership opportunity, but it's also a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| for our seniors to age in place and stay in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| But there's also a moral component to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| There was a great article in The Atlantic that I will pull from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| but we have drawn a border wall around our neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| said, if you don't live in a single family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| then you're not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| And so television screens can depict the immigrants being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| turned away at the border, but they don't capture the way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| working class people are systematically removed from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| neighborhoods, are never given an opportunity to move to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| better neighborhood where maybe their kid might be able to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| a better public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| We never see that because there's an invisible border around our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| neighborhoods, that because in the most prosperous neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| we oftentimes prohibit or obstruct construction of the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| of homes that less advantaged families can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| I, like many of you, believe Knoxville should be a place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| people of all backgrounds can seek and achieve a better life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| for themselves, but campaign slogans, you know, worrying about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| the housing crisis, all are welcome yard signs, aren't enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| to achieve anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3067)|

| 0:51:14| We need to break down the border walls around our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| to support people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| This is one of the most, housing is one of the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| crises facing our city today, maybe second only to substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| abuse, and this is a really small step, and if we can't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| this step, what step can we, you know, to paraphrase from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| article, the huge inequalities between our most affluent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3095)|

| 0:51:43| They are in large part a product of zoning laws that are hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3103)|

| 0:51:51| and in social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| Lest we forget, doing the right thing isn't always easy, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| fact, it isn't even popular at many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Some of the most remarkable things we've achieved as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| and as a country have been broadly unpopular when they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| first implemented, and we turn back in retrospect and we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| dang, we did a really good job, but it was elected officials who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| didn't, you know, only listen to the vocal minority and decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| to make a decision that is right for the people of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| and I think it's important to acknowledge that we actually do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| have an opportunity here, a unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3150)|

| 0:52:44| changing zoning laws to allow the construction of more duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3164)|

| 0:53:36| And I'm here today as a volunteer leader with AARP Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| and I have brought a letter with your permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| This is from the state director of AARP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| It was emailed to you earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3227)|

| 0:53:54| Would that be all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Dear Knoxville City Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| AARP Tennessee has a stalwart belief that all people deserve the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| to have housing that is accessible and affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| It is in that spirit that we support the resolution sponsored by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| Councilwoman Seema Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Surveys by AARP show that most Americans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| including older adults, prefer to live in walkable neighborhoods that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| offer a mix of housing and transportation options that are close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| jobs, schools, shopping, entertainment, and green spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Missing middle housing can meet those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| With a growing aging population, construction of a variety of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| options will become more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Currently, we have thousands of older adults who are house rich but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| cash poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Some would like to sell their home and buy something more affordable or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| accessible in their community, but in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| that type of housing does not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Older adults will also become more reliant on caregivers as they age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| Unpaid family caregivers are the backbone of our long-term care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Missing middle housing can help family members live with or near one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| another to support their loved one while still having their own space or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| The option will also help older adults have the care they need rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| than being forced to spend down their assets to near poverty level to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| qualify for Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| During the COVID crises, we talked a lot about the impact of social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| isolation and the physical and emotional toll it had on older adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| Missing middle housing fits within and helps to generate walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| place-based neighborhoods with community amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| These shared amenities serve as a shared space where neighbors can get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3345)|

| 0:56:01| prevent the creation of missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| In recent years, cities like Memphis, Minneapolis, and the states of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| Nebraska, California, and Oregon have adopted regulations more favorable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| We believe that a neighborhood that includes missing middle housing is well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| positioned to respond to the housing supply, affordability, smart land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| income, equity, and empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| We look forward to being a resource to the sponsor and to the council as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| move forward through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| With that, I'll turn it over to my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Mia McNeil, state director of AARP Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| Thank you, Mr. Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| If there are questions, council will ask you to come back up during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Councilmember Ryder has her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| I don't know if Councilmember Singh, did you want to speak to it first as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| the sponsor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| First off, I want to say thank you to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| I know you guys are working on this piece also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| And then I know that Vice Mayor Roberto is getting together a workshop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| And I'm glad that we're all working on this because this isn't an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| it's a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| The piece that I'm bringing forward tonight is very, very tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| And I'm not asking us to make the decision on whether we should move this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| special permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I'm just saying, can we as a council send this on to planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| One of my biggest regrets on council is we did recode when I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| so many of us were very new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| And as through these last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| I'm seeing the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| We all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| And this is trying to fix one piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Councilmember Ryder, your light is off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| I plan to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| What I appreciate the most about it is this is not a resolution to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| at this time, eliminate the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| It's a resolution to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| And sometimes we need to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| We have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| And I especially will keep, obviously, an open mind about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| So I would like to hear whatever planning staff comes back as far as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| There may be some other aspects to it that I'm not aware of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| And I'll reserve my judgment about whether to approve the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| recommendation of the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| depending on what it was, to the proper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| So, yes, I do plan to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| and look forward to the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| I will make one comment, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| is almost everything that we hear about RECODE is negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| And RECODE has actually done some really good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| And it helped really stabilize the housing situation in a lot of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| district that was just a mix of willy-nilly zoning and growth that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3560)|
| 0:59:30| happened over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| And RECODE actually did more than anything to actually stabilize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| So that doesn't mean that the negative things that are said about RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| are not founded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| It's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| But I think we forget that there were some really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| really positive things about RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| And I can be a witness to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| some of the changes that's happened actually in my district as far as zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| the way the district has grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| how actually the density has increased with infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| So, anyway, just kind of want to add that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| a little bit of a perspective on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| But I appreciate Councilperson Singh bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| And I really appreciate the way that it was done as far as the steps that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| we're taking as far as doing a resolution to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| And it gives us time to digest everything and talk about it without coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| up and having to vote on it every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| Councilmember Singh brought up that we actually did have a workshop on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| We're still tallying the results of what we're going to do for our poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| for workshops this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| But we hope to be able to announce those soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| And this was a topic, so hopefully we'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Deputy to the Mayor Gill, since we had that workshop on missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| and there is the potential for council to have another workshop in the fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| on missing middle, what are you hoping to bring if we do have that workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| a subsequent workshop on missing middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| Well, Vice Mayor Roberto, I'll turn it over to Ms. Gill for more details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| if I don't have those answers at my fingertips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| But I just want to say that Councilmember Singh's resolution is entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| consistent with our efforts to study and also bring to council some proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| And if council wants to have a workshop on missing middle as we have taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| Optico study and moved from the recommendations to how to implement those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| consistent with the urgency of this crisis, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| we'd be happy to do another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| But I just want to say that I share this community's sense that this is a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| Thank you, Councilmember Singh, for bringing this resolution to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And we're not waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| We're moving forward on these issues right now and plan to bring items to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| and to council for review this calendar year to hopefully, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| go into effect in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| So that's all in the works, but it does take some study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| And I couldn't agree more with the comments of the speakers you had before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| in the letter from the AARP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Our zoning ordinance is a huge lever that we do have to address sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| address equity, and address smart growth for all the people who want to live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| our great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| So I think, you know, deploying that lever in an effective way is what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3781)|
| 1:03:08| working on, and this resolution adds to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| So if we were to have a workshop, that would be your anticipation then would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| that we would be reviewing potential language for an ordinance change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Would that ordinance change be more of a targeted solution or more of a blanket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| solution like we're talking about in the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Well, that's what we're working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| And obviously, if you all pass this resolution, we'll continue to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| planning and hear what their recommendations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| I'm very supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I'm glad we had the workshop on missing metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| I think it's an important piece that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| I appreciate my colleague, Council Member Singh, bringing this to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| and also for the ability to study this, because I think that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| You know, I do feel like a more targeted approach would probably be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| But the one thing I wanted us to think about as well is that right now we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| a system in place that allows for transparency through a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| I'm always a big advocate for transparency in a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| So as we're studying this, and this goes to planning and it's further discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| in future potential ordinance changes, I want us to keep in mind that transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| process and having a public process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I'm not sure who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Who's Ms. Ryder or Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| Ms. Parker, are you next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| I just wanted to express my support of this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| I think these are conversations that we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| And when I first saw the proposal, I had to review the zoning code because I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3889)|
| 1:05:00| surprised that – once I looked into it, I was surprised to see how our N2 is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3900)|
| 1:05:09| I would have thought it would allow duplexes by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| So it does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| And hearing that we've had no requests denied is encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3916)|
| 1:05:25| And I think just spending time to see what the impact and what some unintended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| consequences might be is a smart next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| I do think that the missing middle conversation needs to move forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| help also guide future zoning decisions that we might make, zoning changes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| we might make, because it did stand out to me in the workshop that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| recommendation of the consultant is that we start in one area and spread out from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3960)|
| 1:06:11| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| And that did resonate with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| However, especially coming out of recode, I think very clear, intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| transparent processes are very important, especially when making major changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| But as others have said, this is a process that will have multiple opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| And as I said, I think it's a conversation that we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| And I think that it could be a good change for our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| So I do support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| I actually would like to potentially propose, I would like to propose a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| amendment if Councilwoman Singh would be willing to support that, which is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| broaden the request a little bit beyond just the special use, because in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| missing middle housing study, there's many other barriers that are listed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| duplexes, and knowing that we've had two dozen requests for duplexes approved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| special use, my thoughts are that the special use is not the greatest barrier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| So I would like to propose an amendment for the Planning Commission to include in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| their recommendation an analysis or comments on the dimensional standards like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| minimum lot size, lot coverage, and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| Because the 10,000, so that's my amendment, friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| It's very friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Well, someone has to second it for it to actually be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| That was a motion I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Motion's been made to amend, has been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| The amendment is to include, to ask the Knox County, Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| Commission to include in their recommendation a review of dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| including minimum lot size, lot coverage, and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Ms. Gill, I was wondering if you could just speak to that, since I know you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| leading an effort to study these issues already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| My name is Erin Gill, and I want to recognize that we have several of this team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| in the audience, but this is a cross-departmental team, because I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| to your point, Councilwoman Ryder, we recognize the complexity in actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| unlocking the missing middle housing goes far beyond just what is allowed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| special use or as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| So we are in the process of fully vetting those proposed changes to thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| address those issues and recognizing that the potential for one change to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| be mirrored by a change elsewhere in the code leaves an opportunity for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| to be kind of stuck, or we thought we were doing something and then didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| actually do it because there's some other adjustment that needed to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| So we are in the process of that methodical approach, and with specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| regard to some of those more comprehensive considerations, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| currently part of that analysis, and to your point, it is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| Setbacks, building height, design principles, also in that mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| So we would not at all oppose that amendment, and we would consider it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| support this analysis that is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| Councilmember Ryder, on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| I just made an amendment, and I just wanted to make another comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| In full disclosure, I own a duplex on a 50-by-150-foot lot in an R&2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| so I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Some of you may know my tenants, and I've owned it before for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| and the problems in the past have been more management and upkeep of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| There's been no other issues with it, so I just want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| So I think that's just fair for me to disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| Okay, noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| Speaking to the amendment, I like that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| And the targeted approach that the administration is working on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| Opticost, they had talked about several different strategies at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| and the targeted approach was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| My concern, we need all hands on deck right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| The targeted approach, I'd like to ask Hanson Sayles if he would speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Sayles, if he would speak to this, about the equity aspect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| Mr. Sayles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| Hanson Sayles, again, 609 Weissgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| I'll just preface with, obviously we don't have an official position because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| there isn't an official proposal, but we're very supportive and actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| working with the city on the missing middle housing strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| and we'll certainly support a targeted approach, I presume in part because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| anything is better than nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| But to the equity point, I think it's really important that this country has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| long history of applying different standards to different communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| and the beauty of removing something at a zoning district level is that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| not saying, well, only the people who won't push back, which typically are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| areas with less social mobility, lower income, the people who don't have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| to come up to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| We're applying the same standard to the communities that also are affluent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| and who are very well organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I think there's a beauty in addressing something at a zoning district level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| and that it applies uniformly to people across the city and moves away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| the scenarios that we, our country, as many of you know, has a long history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| of applying different standards to different areas, and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| considerable negative consequences of doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| And that has often reinforced a lot of economic and, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| racial segregation in many of our communities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| We're not immune, but that's what I would add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| I'll just say I reiterate a lot of what's already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| You know, we have repeatedly talked about and listened to the urgent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| and critical need of housing in this city, and I would just say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| at what point do we become problem solvers and not road blockers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| Restrictive zoning, especially single-family zoning, creates a high hurdle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| for affordable housing, and we are over-regulating these opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| caving to the nimbyism and resigning to settle for the status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| which continues to confine ourselves to preexisting demographic patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| that keep promoting disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| So, I mean, to me, duplexes are simply single-family homes with two front doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| But not supporting this, we are saying that our young professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| our nurses, our first responders, our seniors, our teachers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| aren't good enough to be our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| And, you know, many of those young professionals are future homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| if they choose to rent within those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| And we also need to allow the private sector to help us remedy this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| You know, they're committed and invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| There are many who are committed and invested to addressing the affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| And, you know, recode, as we've always said, is a living document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| and this makes a great deal of sense to modify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| and be able to remove barriers to progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| So, and again, I go back to it's just impacting 20% of the residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| So I actually would like to see this expanded to triplexes and townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| and other affordable housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| But I certainly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| And I think it's a great first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| I just have one comment to add to the point Vice Mayor Roberto made about public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| that it be more than just the planning commission meetings and our council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| that it doesn't have to be a full recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| But I do think making people understand this or helping people understand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| takes many rounds of listening and hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| and that I think the more we can host those types of educational forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| outside of these walls and in neighborhoods, I think we'll produce a better outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| I totally underline that, and that's the most important thing, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| And I take a special interest in this missing middle approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| because it's my district that's primarily targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| So I know my neighbors really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| There's generally an improvement in the district that has been brought about just by recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| And there's infill that's been appreciated by the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| It's in harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| So I'm going to look at this very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| because it appears what has been taking place in certain areas that are targeted by missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4557)|
| 1:16:06| actually has a system right now that is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| I can't say it won't be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| but we definitely need to hear from the neighbors and those affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| So I look forward to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| I welcome an approach that studies something to increase the housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| without these huge multi-unit apartment buildings that have their place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4593)|
| 1:16:44| absolutely have their place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| But as far as livability and what the person from AARP was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| I welcome an approach that increases the housing stock in a way that's more pedestrian friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| and is a better quality of life than some of the units that we've been building in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| So anyway, I welcome this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| I'll be paying a lot of attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| And let's move forward on it and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Speaking still to the amendment, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| And I just want to commend Councilwoman Singh for bringing this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| and for your administration for continuing to have a focus on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| When we talk about affordable housing, it still begs the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| what's affordable and to whom it's affordable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| So I saw Mr. Bentley here, and I don't know if ‑‑ I hate to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| but if you even can tell us an estimate of what a Section 8 rent would be for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| and I think duplexes are typically either one to two bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| And I would say maybe two bedrooms for a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| So it would vary a little bit based on, so we tie a lot of our rents to small area fair market rents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| that are published by HUD on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| knowing we're trying to increase landlord participation in our programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| and in certain parts of town they are able on the private market to get a different rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| than they would be in other parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| So it varies a little bit, but I would say a good estimate community‑wide would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| and this is the rent we charge both as a subsidy and to the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| So the individual in almost no cases would actually pay this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| but I would say 800 is probably a good estimate for a two‑bedroom unit on a voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| That fluctuates a little bit, though, based on the geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Mr. Bentley, director of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Just quickly, I wanted to echo the points raised by Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4734)|
| 1:19:05| I'm a supporter of missing middle, but I don't feel that it is our, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| the solution to our crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| We need more tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| I think this is one of the tools, but not necessarily the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| And part of that is early in the pandemic, during my research on what other cities were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4763)|
| 1:19:32| to address affordable housing, a lot of cities were looking at tiny homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| and building tiny homes and putting them on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| and expecting them to sell, you know, for maybe $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| But they were, you know, these new developments, a smart use of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| They work for a lot of different demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| People were making these, you know, neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| small pocket neighborhoods with the tiny homes so you had a little community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| And they became popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| And I spoke with leaders in a couple of cities where they saw bidding wars on tiny homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| that they had approved to provide affordable housing for their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| And so that's one reason why I keep, you know, pushing the fact that we do need, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| more different types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| We need more options for our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| But when it comes to the affordability, we're just going to have to be very intentional about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| because, you know, we can't predict the market is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4836)|
| 1:20:45| And a lot of these developments have become very popular as of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| So I'm in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| But we've got to keep doing more to increase our affordable housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=4859)|

| 1:23:20| dollars by rebidding a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| Mr. Clabo, do you want to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| I'll kick it over to Mr. Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Could you just explain while we're jumping over this hurdle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Tom Clabo, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| So in mid-June, we go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| The Severe Avenue Streetscapes Project is divided into two contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| One of those being a utility relocation contract, so moving aerial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| utilities underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| And then the second is a roadway contract that's got federal funds in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| So we bid the utility contract mid-June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| It came in well over our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Had one bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| So we're going to repackage the construction documents, split that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| into actually three contracts now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| So it will be a roadway and two separate utility contracts, trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| better isolate the type of work to the contractors, try to get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| So just for the public's benefit, this actually is an increase, but in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| the grand scheme of the project and this bidding process, it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| actually save us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| And we still plan to break ground by the end of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| We hope to get all three contracts bid this fall with the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5074)|

| 1:25:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| What this so everyone knows in the public what we're doing here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| we've had some difficulty with having permits being issued on time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| and one of the recommendations from the matrix study was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| maybe to look at having an outside firm do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| So I'm very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| I think everyone else is too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| but I just didn't want to pass it without anyone saying what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| You know, one of the ways that we need to make sure we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| the housing crisis is make sure we're getting permits out timely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| and so I want to commend staff and the administration for 25 days into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| new budget, getting something together so that we can start to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| I also want to just make sure that we continue to look at this in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| we do need to hire more staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| because that was one of the other recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| but I appreciate the promptness of getting this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5172)|

| 1:33:27| The main thing, so this was bid out as a construction manager type project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| We had interest from four local contractors that do this type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| The pricing kind of came back as what it is and at that point, there was some value engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| that could occur on a normal project, but we did not want to undertake that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| There's a couple of quantitative and qualitative considerations that really led to the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| being what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| Quality conditions in terms of construction costs, there's greater interest carrying costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| relative to construction period right now because interest rates have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| So there was a time three or four years ago when we would have paid no carrying costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| on construction interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| We could have gotten a 0% interest loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| Right now in this project, that number is 400,000, so that's just one data point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| immediately drives that cost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| Site work, this is a free site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| Knox County gave it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| We're thrilled about it, but there was significant grading that went into that number that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| not be present at all sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| Outside of those quantitative things, there were some qualitative choices we made about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| We felt like it was very important to make it a great place for veterans to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| So in this case, from an energy efficiency standpoint, there are solar panels involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| We haven't done that anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| We think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| It's fully furnished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| There are, I mean, recognizing that folks that have, you know, that may be coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| an experience where they don't have the possessions that some of us enjoy in life, we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| make sure that that's present when they step in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| So that was a pretty significant line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| Typically on a 32-unit development, four stories, we would not be putting in an elevator, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| accessibility for all of these units is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| So that elevator on a small project drove up the costs a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| And then there's additional in any of these, I mean, Callahan Flats, so we're not exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| they would have had these costs as well, but Menville and this one, we're doing additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| community space and amenities that would not be there maybe on a traditional affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| So there's several factors that go into that, and we above all want to see those costs down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| but those are some of them, and I'm happy to unpack it further, but I can't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| you would want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Ten more minutes of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| No, I know that you're a good steward of monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Just that was, I just had questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| I'm excited about the solar panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| The other piece, real quick, the $500,000, I think it is important not just to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5737)|
| 1:35:49| the total project cost, but on a per door basis, we're at about $15,000 per unit from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| the city's contribution on this project, and I think as, you know, stewards of the affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| rental development funds, it's really important to consider what you're getting per unit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| your contribution, and so the total project cost is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| We want to see it come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| The city's contribution is actually relatively low compared to most projects that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| Thank you, Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Councilmember Parker, and then Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| I brought this up before on the Callahan Flats project, but for me, when it comes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| permanent supportive housing, I want to encourage us to make the investment to make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| get the best end product that we can and really continue to embrace that trauma-informed design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5798)|
| 1:36:49| I heard good things from the increased cost, like the solar panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| I'm still not hearing about the trauma-informed design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| And so, you know, I just want to encourage, I guess, my colleagues and others to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5819)|
| 1:37:08| that we invest in these types of properties and not pinch pennies, but make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| we are creating spaces of healing, spaces where folks are able to, you know, regain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| some stabilization, move on potentially to other permanent housing, and not cut pennies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| So I just wanted to lift that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Well said, Councilperson Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| I also want to give you kudos for the solar panels, and thanks for finding room in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| budgeted money to be able to include those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| And, of course, the payback further for the residents will be it's going to lower their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| KUV bills, so we're talking affordability with the solar panels, so keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5871)|

| 1:38:52| Council members, there's two people signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| First is Mr. Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Hi there, Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5939)|
| 1:39:07| We need to approve this so we can get back to the business of administratively approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| plats because that is often a huge hurdle in doing infill redevelopment in the Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| We still have to get rid of ward lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| Maybe that's calming down some, we hope, but that's been the biggest experience I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| And then sometimes I have these weird little lots that there's a private alley or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| next to it that I end up owning and then I have to combine it and I have to replat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| And if we have to go to a meeting for each one of these, we are just adding more and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| more days of delay before we can break ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| And like we had earlier, you know, Peter's office is drowning with permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| Perhaps maybe we need to look at that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| I keep thinking that we could shrink that, the drawing requirements down for single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| homes, but all of this together means that we're delaying getting started building houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| and we're in a housing crisis and we need to find every possible way to streamline this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| process and it starts right here with correcting this oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6010)|

| 1:40:17| Mr. Lynch, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record and you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6019)|

| 1:40:26| I'm a registered land surveyor and I'm here to be of assistance in any sort of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| We appreciate all your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Appreciate Director Brooks and putting this on the agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| So if you need anything as far as questions or concerns, but we do ask that you vote yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| to 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6042)|

| 1:40:47| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Just for clarity, this is coming to us because there was a state law change and we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| codifying what we're actually already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Ms. Brooks, is that, that's my understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Ms. Brooks, I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Number one, well, I'll ask number one secondly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| I'll start with my number one will be if I have two lots and I move lot lines and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6073)|
| 1:41:20| things and that goes through a replat process, does that apply to this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Yeah, that would be terrible if we had to vote on every single one of us changing our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| Because I personally have changed my lot line and replatted my property that I live on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| times since I moved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| So y'all would hate it if we had to vote on that at every council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| Just to clarify, it wouldn't come to council, it would come to planning commission, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| full planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| So you guys would have to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Well, the planning commission would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| Still, that'd be quite silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| So part of the question is, I know I asked you who sponsored it at the state level and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| we talked about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| So you don't have to necessarily go down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| But do we have any real understanding as to why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| Like what was the madness behind the method or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I cannot speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6138)|

| 1:52:07| application and also the nature of the joint application with the county? Chief Noel. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| ma'am. Paul Noel, Police Chief. We talked about this last year. This is the annual grant that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| do. We apply jointly with the county, I believe, because of the Homeland Security District. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| fully awarded, the formula would be approximately $109,000 for the city, about $45,000 for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| county, but because we have a joint Homeland Security agreement with the county, that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| this grant would have to apply together. And the technology, could you talk more about the technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6756)|
| 1:52:44| Yes, so this is the 2023 grant. Right now, we're actually on JAG 2020, so we're about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6764)|
| 1:52:51| two to three years behind. The DOJ is about two to three years behind of awarding this. Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| we're still in the process of putting together our budget for this. Previously, what we've used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| for this right now in 2020, we bought the 3D crime scene mapping software, computer equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6783)|

| 1:53:53| so as we do every year, we would likely to have to do a grant adjustment as our priorities a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| years from now would change. Perfect, thank you, and just so you know, I ask these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6838)|

| 1:54:29| you know, grant proposals that have come before us, and so I ask these questions each time it comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| to try to get these updates on how these funds are being spent, so I appreciate it. Yes, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| that's why I wanted to give you an update on what we spend on the 2020, which is actually the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| we're in right now, so, you know, 2020 seems like a while back, but that's, we're spending that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6886)|
| 1:54:53| right now. Thank you for that. Thank you, any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6893)|

| 1:55:34| Parker. Thank you, Mayor. For this grant program, is this a one-time funding allocation for the 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6934)|
| 1:55:47| positions? My understanding is that it's ongoing. Chief Noel, is that correct? That's our understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| as well. This is going to be ongoing, but again, that obviously could change based upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| And so it seems, you know, quite likely, since it's state funding and there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6957)|
| 1:56:09| it's quite likely that NASA will get the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| Would the money that we currently have budgeted for these positions then be reallocated to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| use? I think we'll have to see if we get the grant and also, you know, what the budget looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6979)|
| 1:56:28| like at that time, you know, but yeah, that's a possibility. That was one thing that stood out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6988)|
| 1:56:37| me is it's the one time I applaud the state's funding. If you want to replace city funds so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=6997)|
| 1:56:46| that we can use it on something else, then yay, that's wonderful. But I do think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| that we acknowledge this new funding and acknowledge the urgent needs that we have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| other departments and consider other uses for the $750,000 if the state is going to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7018)|

| 1:57:39| So I've spoken with the Chief about this. I think there are a lot of people wondering why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7059)|
| 1:57:52| Brooklyn was, why her stay was so temporary. And the only answer that people have been getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| is that that's what we expected right from the beginning. I want to respect if she has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| some personal reasons, but I would also like to address a lot of people's questions about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| happened. Thank you, Council Member Singh. I just want to say that Chief Belk did amazing work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7087)|
| 1:58:16| her short tenure with the City. We did think it would be short, but, you know, things didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| think it would necessarily be this short. So we appreciate all that she did to help us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| redevelop and get started on the Office of Professional Standards and start examining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| policies. And I have to say that I think it's proven to be quite invaluable to have someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7113)|
| 1:58:39| with a law degree inside working and helping the Police Department. So we are, you know, she did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7119)|
| 1:58:47| a great job. And, you know, as with many people with talents, different opportunities arise and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7127)|
| 1:58:54| you know, she's moving on to other opportunities. Chief Noel, did you have anything you wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7134)|
| 1:59:02| add? Absolutely. So, you know, she was exceptionally qualified. That's obvious. And this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| that we're very committed to. This is, you know, obviously a priority of the Mayor and myself to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| have a person and an attorney in the position of Office of Professional Standards. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7153)|
| 1:59:21| while Chief Belk was only with us for a limited amount of time, we really we hope to have her a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| lot longer than this. I've said that publicly on media outlets, you know, a lot. But we also knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| that she was not going to be with us forever. She was going to come in and really help stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7170)|
| 1:59:36| this up and then move on. So we absolutely had big shoes to fill. You know, she created the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| ever Office of Professional Standards, which is a big accomplishment to stand something up that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| didn't exist. She started the process of building policies and systems which did not exist before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7187)|
| 1:59:54| And while that's not completed yet, her successor that we hope to find a permanent person to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7194)|
| 2:00:01| that job is going to finish that. She did the heavy lifting of standing that up and creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| the dialogue around not only the policies but the systems that didn't exist. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| one thing I haven't spoken, you know, a lot about is she dramatically increased the efficiency of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7212)|
| 2:00:19| our internal investigations. In many cases they take months, in some cases even like a year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| complete. In most cases now we get these investigations done in about 30 days and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| longer than 60 days to have these internal investigations done, which creates a due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| not only for our officers but for people who file complaints as well, knowing that they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| be resolved in a kind of expediently, as quickly as possible. And, you know, she's no longer a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7239)|
| 2:00:46| member of our team, but I think I could speak for every member of KPD that we're better off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| having had her on the team even in the short amount of time that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| So what I'm hearing is that she did some great work in setting everything up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| different opportunities come along, people come, people go, no drama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| I mean, you know, we hire exceptional people and, you know, she's, you know, obviously very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| qualified, highly sought after. And, you know, my job right now is to go out and find the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| person to permanently fill this job. And we're advertising all across the country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7275)|

| 2:01:25| Guyton temporarily is to keep that work going and show our commitment to this, because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| absolutely committed to this and we don't want to lose any ground. And Judge Guyton is not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| be the permanent individual in this job. We're trying to find that individual now. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| something that I'm focused on now and keeping this, keeping our momentum going as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| Thank you. I'll just add that, you know, again, it's been really helpful to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| Chief Belk's contributions. We don't want to lose any momentum. And I appreciate all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7311)|
| 2:01:57| she did in her short tenure and respect her decision to move on to the next phase of her career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7317)|
| 2:02:04| Any other questions? Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| Thank you, Mayor. And I appreciate the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7326)|
| 2:02:15| But I do have some concerns. And I did have a chance to speak with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| Chief about this. And they're somewhat twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7338)|
| 2:02:25| I believe changes, reforms are needed in terms of internal affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| I've had complaints brought to me by officers and concerns raised about a lack of trust in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7352)|
| 2:02:42| process, in the internal affairs process. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| I agree that that needs to be a priority when we talk about reforms needed within KBD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| However, we also have to maintain a commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7371)|
| 2:03:01| addressing issues of racism and sexism within KBD. And this departure is one that does concern me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7381)|

| 2:03:23| about what happened. And so, one thing that I wanted to lift up is it's important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7403)|
| 2:03:32| this reform of internal affairs moves forward, but it's also important that we remain committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| to that process. And part of remaining committed to that process means that when we have instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7416)|
| 2:03:46| like the need to now replace Belk, that we're able to review what happened and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7426)|
| 2:03:58| we are doing what we need to do as a city to support our minority officers who have told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7438)|
| 2:04:07| in the past that they have not felt supported within the department previously. Are we giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7447)|
| 2:04:19| support to black staff, to women, so that they aren't getting pushed out of organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7459)|
| 2:04:30| or pushed out of spaces within the city? And if we are quickly to move on and we don't review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| those moments, then we're not going to be able to address them. And these are tough issues. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| what I've dedicated my career to. These are the tough conversations that I have all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| and I will tell you they're uncomfortable and people do not like to have them about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7489)|
| 2:04:57| dealing with racism and sexism within the work environment. And so, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7497)|
| 2:05:06| not opposed to this appointment. I wish it did not come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| because in my opinion, I cannot imagine really an independent temporary contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7511)|
| 2:05:19| serving in the role that we're asking the judge to serve because they're doing the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7519)|
| 2:05:28| a permanent staff person would do. They have to have that authority for this to work. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7528)|
| 2:05:35| I have to trust in this moment that you all believe this person as an independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| temporary contractor will have the authority to be effective in this role on a short-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7542)|
| 2:05:55| So, I'll support it tonight, but I encourage us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| not lose sight of the work that needs to be done, the difficult conversations that need to be had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7557)|
| 2:06:06| the transparency that's needed for our community. It really does so much more good than it does bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7566)|
| 2:06:15| to just have some transparency and some honest conversations about what we're experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7575)|
| 2:06:22| in our city. So, that's what I encourage. Thank you. Vice Mayor Roberto. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| Mayor. I appreciate the focus on filling the position quickly and keeping this work going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| I think it's really, this is a very critical role and I agree with what I was hearing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| We don't want to, you know, slow down the progress that's being made. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| I think this is very important. So, I definitely plan on supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| Chief, or if there's somebody else who can talk to us about it, the allocation is quite a large one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7608)|
| 2:06:57| that we're seeing here. Now, I imagine because you're looking for somebody who's got a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7617)|
| 2:07:04| that's a lawyer and this is a temporary role that that may be leading to what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| monetary amount is here, but just wanted to take a couple minutes to maybe let you talk to us about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7630)|
| 2:07:16| you know, the justification for the expense here. I think it's a very critical role, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| it is a large amount. Absolutely, Vice Mayor. So, obviously, Judge Guyton is immensely qualified. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| has decades of legal experience here in Knoxville serving as a federal judge and also, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7645)|
| 2:07:33| the uniqueness of the fact that he is not interested in serving in this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| on a permanent basis. He's only coming in as a stopgap. You know, this position could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| could only last several months and, you know, based on his qualifications and the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| this is only a temporary contract, I absolutely believe that the cost of this contract is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7669)|
| 2:07:57| absolutely worth it. And, you know, if you want to get quality individuals, I think we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| compensate them fairly. Thank you. Any other questions or discussion? Vice Mayor Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7680)|

| 2:09:45| You can come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| My name is John Zieda, and I'm here to discuss, and I live at 48 N. Care Court, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7790)|
| 2:10:04| Tennessee, and I'm here to discuss two stores that were stolen by the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| and it's all provable, especially one of them. They got a couple of things in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7811)|
| 2:10:17| Both of them were Palestinian-owned immigrants. They called Knoxville home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7817)|
| 2:10:26| The city stole them. The city burned them, and the city led us to believe that a black man did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7826)|
| 2:10:37| I can't prove my father's story that it was burned by the city, but I can prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| that the city stole it, and maybe if we see the arson pictures, we'll see that the city burned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| also. You're not going to be able to see this store. The picture's too small. The store was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| a viable business on Martin Luther King. Somewhere around June of 2012, the city shut down Mr. Ayish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7855)|
| 2:11:06| The city shut him down under nuisance. Whatever the reason was, we're not going to go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7866)|
| 2:11:16| Whatever the reason was, what we're going to go into is how did the city go inside that store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7876)|
| 2:11:24| and burn it. The city burned it, and it happened December 29, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7884)|
| 2:11:34| This year, I spoke to Fire Captain Partin, and I'm sure he dislikes being put in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7894)|
| 2:11:44| He stated that it was an experiment. We cannot have an experiment when India McDowell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7904)|
| 2:11:54| on the police report stated that he burned the store. Is it an experiment with the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7914)|
| 2:12:05| or Mr. Gourley? We cannot have both as arsonists. It's one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7925)|
| 2:12:14| It's one or the other. Both these owners, my father, around 1980, we were all younger. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7934)|
| 2:12:21| of us not even born. I asked my father did he like Knoxville while he was inside Gaswalker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| He spent his life there. He was standing like this watching the customers coming and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7948)|
| 2:12:35| at that moment where he had a chance not to be actively busy. He stated yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7955)|
| 2:12:43| he liked Knoxville. I remember when Gaswalker put that sign for the building for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| It was right in front of my father's car. So when he came to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| he seen that sign, and one day he decided to buy that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7972)|
| 2:12:59| Who would have thought that this city would go inside these businesses and burn them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7979)|
| 2:13:07| I hate to put Stan, I forgot your last name, into this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| but we're here and I want to ask you, who burned the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=7993)|
| 2:13:22| That's exactly how I thought I was going to go get the answer. That's exactly the answer I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8002)|
| 2:13:30| We've got our answer. The city burned it. The city owes my father a check for that store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8010)|
| 2:13:38| the store that you people stole. You stole Gaswalkers from my family. My father worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8018)|

| 2:13:59| investigators, Daryl Whitaker, he picks up the phone to Mr. Ayers probably. Now that part I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| know, but I can imagine. He says, Mr. Ayers, we had a homeless black man inside your store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8045)|
| 2:14:14| and he burned it. And nobody burned it but the city. I want a check for my father's store. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8054)|
| 2:14:22| I realize I am 60. We can want in one hand and get in another. But nobody in his right, it's bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8062)|

| 2:15:03| Who would have thought that this city would burn the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| Thank you for your time. This is not finished. I promise you. Mr. Ayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8108)|

| 2:17:00| why Ms. Bell chose to leave Knoxville? Because as has already been highlighted, we already know by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| public that there are definitely internal issues because as she said before, the employees told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| these issues. So it's no surprise that Knoxville's fascist, racist, bigotry ran Ms. Bell off. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8230)|
| 2:17:18| blame her. I was in conversation with Bell myself and I won her. Do not become part of the catalog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8238)|
| 2:17:24| of black faces for white supremacy in Knoxville. They're great at tokenism here and you don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| to be a part of those issues because you are new here. Don't get caught up in the mess of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8249)|

| 2:17:46| about the games because y'all continue to play the games. Hey Knoxville, isn't it true that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8266)|

| 2:17:58| now that we're in election season and Len Fugate and a few other folks that went on record talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| about they brought affordability to Knoxville, we are now seeing these failed and pathetic attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| to try to savage the last bit of credibility of India's so-called administration and what she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| thinks she can play our city with, these false allegations of affordability. But we know the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8293)|
| 2:18:19| Again, as I told you from day one, data has already caught you. Two recent reports came out. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| one said that Knoxville, you're no longer annually $75,000 or less a year. We now know that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8304)|
| 2:18:31| make $75,000 less a year in Knoxville, you can only afford 12% of the housing market. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8311)|

| 2:18:54| conversations of affordable housing because in reality, it does not exist. Literally, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8334)|

| 2:19:36| but India's only in the lead due to just that, money, not votes. She ain't got the same backing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230725?start=8376)|
