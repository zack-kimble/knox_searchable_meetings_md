| 0:07:30| When was that last done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| 9-24-2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| His task was completed April 5th, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=457)|
| 0:07:45| So here's the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| We can, if you want to speak to it, or I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| No, go ahead, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| It's a little unusual that he's got the same manager at the same place, same location, different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=475)|
| 0:08:05| He's got a, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| The ownership structure has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| So that's requiring a new application, a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Previously, on some cases, this one's a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| but in some cases, we've required that everyone have a new background check and a new task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=497)|
| 0:08:25| However, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| It's up to our discretion and, you know, I'll call on you, Mr. Roberto, and you can speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| So, every, all the folks are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| It's just that, you know, you had this back in April of 2018 last, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=518)|
| 0:08:46| That was his task he completed then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| When was the background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| This background check was September 24th, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| If we postpone until the next beer board, would that put you guys back any, or are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Indeed it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Can I clarify for the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| This is a manager, not an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| The ownership changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| The ownership structure changed, as he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| But the management hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| But the management hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| What we had heard was that the fingerprinting and everything was going to get taken care of tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| What would be our recourse if something came up in that report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| If we passed it subject to final documentation tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| Or would we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Well, it would be subject to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| It would have to come back to us to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| We've said in past meetings that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| I'll let Rob answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Let me ask Sergeant Coward this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Mr. Amrine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| D. Pietro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| He's the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| How much ownership interest do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Sergeant Coward, if these gentlemen dropped tonight, Mr. D. Pietro is the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| Could he come in and they get approved because everything else has been checked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Could he come in at a later date and then be added back in, added on it because we change managers with places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| and they don't have to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Or maybe I need to ask that away, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| The manager change doesn't come in front of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Currently, he's the only one who can satisfy the annual alcohol training per the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| Have any of you all taken the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| I took task in May of 2017, so it's not current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| But, again, Chris is current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| His task is within the last 12 calendar months, and his records and fingerprints are within the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=654)|
| 0:11:03| Dropping Mr. D. Pietro might not work out if nobody else is going to be able to stay there on the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| that has passed task within the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Could we approve it subject to there not being any changes in his background check since his last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| When was his last background check again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| September 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| So we're talking four or five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| Why don't we approve it subject to passing the task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Can he take it Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Isn't there one on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| One of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Oh, one of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Subject to both, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I mean, I feel comfortable because if we don't approve this today, then he remains the manager now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| I mean, am I correct there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| I was talking with Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| They can still operate as far as selling beer if they are postponed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| but I don't know what type of business transaction they have going on that's causing the change of ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| nor is it any of my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| And I'm pretty comfortable that he passed the background check that said September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| We have delays over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| So we have delays for a lot longer than that where they pass and we're pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| waiting to get other permits done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| I think that in this case, it's a pretty short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Well, and I wanted to mention I appreciate, I know, I don't remember which one of you I spoke with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| but about your server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I appreciate you getting that to me right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| So based on that, I'll move to approve subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Define that final documentation a little bit better, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| What were we missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| The background check manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| So, yeah, and also, I mean, did we go through the other list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| I'm not sure we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Sales tax registration, certificate of zoning, building inspection approval, and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| So that would be what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| You got all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| So this would, you generally have a policy of not doing this, but this is for future reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| This is for special, limited circumstances where there's a continuity in the management of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| so we don't get into a situation where it's totally changed and people have never been in before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| And that's what the background check five months ago, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| So he's asking, I think what Rob's asking for is for it to be no significant changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| from the background check that was done in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Is it going to be the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Yeah, everything's going to be exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| We understand what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Pending final documentation subject to no significant changes in the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=836)|

| 0:14:21| Isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=861)|

| 0:21:51| Hello. I'm Alexandria Goldschmidt, and the business address is 4901 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| Sargent Cower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| We need the sales tax registration, your certificate of zoning, and your building inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| Do you think you can get those things together in the next week or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| Yes, ma'am. I've applied for the business tax already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| We are dealing with zoning with Scott Eldridge, I think was the name today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| because there was some confusion with we have a very similar name to my father's food truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| and he was looking at their website, and that's why I think he wasn't approving the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| because I've had a permit there before two years ago, and everything is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Okay. The previous business was yours as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| It was my father's, so I was manager at that time, but we closed down for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| and we are reopening, but I'm reopening everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Okay. Approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Mr. Frost, what do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| When I was reviewing the beer board permit, excuse me, application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| I recognized this as being the former Badgett Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| and I remember two and a half years ago there were some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Now, a recode workshop is not supposed to break out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| but there's an issue with a primary and an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| I'm not kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| So when are you planning on, it's Scott Elder, when are you planning on meeting with him, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| I talked with Mark Bird today, and he had gotten an e-mail about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| we've gotten all this real last minute, but I couldn't get a hold of anyone with zoning today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| so my plan is to get back with them as soon as I can tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| I'm pretty positive we cleared up the issue with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| because they asked me to submit a document of exactly what we were doing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| and we're still running the same kind of business without food this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| so there's one less thing on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| But, yeah, I think the only issue is that he was looking at a website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and in the e-mail it said that our website contradicted what the business was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| but he was, I think, confused that we're a different business than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| I mean, you know, the beer board, if it wants to, you can pass subject to final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| because that final documentation does include the certificate of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| Now, I mean, it would be out of the beer board's hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| and, you know, the chief zoning official for the city, Mr. Elder, would take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| and if there's a determination that they do not meet the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| then the certificate, the beer permit will not be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| So is the issue here about the property and there's a different primary use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| Are there multiple structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| No, the former use is a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| It was a privately owned land that was leased by the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| and that lease went away three or four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| So it zones something like open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| and as a primary use you cannot have a restaurant in an open space zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| but in some circumstances it can be an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| So they would have to go in and meet with Mr. Elder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| and show them how what they're proposing is an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| Yes, or they would have to get a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| and the beer permit would be contingent on that passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Yes, because they have to get the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| And how would we, would Mr. Elder contact us or the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| If the zoning didn't go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| If the zoning doesn't go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| then I guess he would contact the business tax office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Yes, they just wouldn't get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Because the business tax office is not going to let go of that beer permit document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| until they can check all the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Correct, and after a period of time it would come back to you for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| because it hasn't been completed, and then you could act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Yes, if it hadn't been resolved in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1565)|

| 0:28:24| Clinch River Brewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| This was to the manufacturer and distribution and on-off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1707)|
| 0:28:44| Kathy Taylor, Clinch River Brewing, 531 Gay Street, 37902, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| Do you need my address at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| No, that's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| So, August, last August, what was approved, pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| extended in November when we're back here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| so you can give us an update on where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| As far as I know, we are opening sometime in the early summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| That's the last I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| So you need for us to extend this for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Ninety days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Another 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| That'll take almost a year around, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Gwen, what do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Do we normally do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| We normally do, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| It's subject to what you think, so subject to discussion, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| Comments, feedback from my colleagues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Are you pretty confident you'll be open in 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| or be able to get the permit in 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| My confidence is not that of Mr. and Mrs. Shirey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| I'm their general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| So anything that I say is not necessarily coming straight from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| When I saw them yesterday, they asked if I could be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| and I said, well, what can I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| So here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| From what I understand, that is the plan moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| and they do have some things that they're working on of which I'm not privy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| I'm normally out in the Norris area right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| but that was what they said to me yesterday was to please come and visit you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| So that would take March, April, May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| So it would take essentially until June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Actually, he asked me did I have a lot of things on my agenda for May so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| and I said, no, I'll be finished with school then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| That was where we left it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I'm comfortable extending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| I'll move to extend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| but I would not be comfortable with additional extensions after this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Is that 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| We'll do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| So then we'll do the same for the on-off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| We'll motion to extend it for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1873)|

| 0:31:15| So it's both extended for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Elst Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| Shane Todd, Elst Brewing Company, 2417-2419 North Central Street, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| So this was approved last May, May 22nd of 18, pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| It's been extended in August and extended again in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| So where are you today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Hopefully inching closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I'm confident another 90-day extension will get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| or else I'm dragging the contractor here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| It should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| I'll motion we extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| So that, just so you know, that would take him a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| It would take him a year from the time he's had his background check and his task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| Right, Sergeant Cowan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| He's had that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| So, you know, you could require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| I mean, he will have expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| So we could ask that he retake the task class and redo the background check since it's been a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| But then they would have to also repay the fee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| I guess that's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I mean, that's sort of where I am on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I mean, it's difficult to open up a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| and obviously if they've been wrestling with it for a year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| it's just another fee and hurdle they'll have to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| And we did receive the manufacturing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| So that's been, the distribution side has been going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| So it's just literally the construction has been the holdup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| And that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| And if they show up and say that they're continuing to work on it, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| you could get a background check and commit a crime the following day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| He does have to take the task class once a year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| He has to take it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| So those are our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Can I just, slightly related, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| what are the holdups with the construction process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| The general contractor has been extremely busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Obviously there's a lot of growth and demand around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| And, you know, we get to a point and then they disappear for a week or two doing other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| Same old story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| It's been frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| I mean, you know, it's just doing the best I can, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| I'm okay with the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| I would like to see them approved after 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| So motion is second to approve for 90 days, extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190226?start=2034)|
