| 0:00:00| come to some kind of agreement, you know, in terms of how have they negotiated with the outdoor advertising people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| Has it been a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=9)|
| 0:00:11| Has it been a, you know, an edict or just so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=11)|
| 0:00:17| I'd like to see what other successful municipalities have done and us try to emulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| Commissioner, unfortunately I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=23)|
| 0:00:26| Mark has done most of the legwork on this ordinance, but obviously we can certainly find that out and get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=26)|
| 0:00:33| because it's probably could be very valuable information in this interim 60-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| If I could, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner McKenzie, I've been researching this as well from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| I've already spoken to an attorney in another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| Some counties pass the ordinance and they litigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| Others try to do pre-suit mediation, and others after the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| So there's kind of a mixed bag, but there's a few out there that have survived challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| and I was going to compile those, so this is beneficial to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| Commissioner, it's just, and I agree that we need to have more input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| My position is that we're not talking about just a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| We're talking about an industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| This industry not only employs people who work for the billboard companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| but you're also talking about people who utilize those to help their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| For example, I just saw some candidates running for election on a billboard as I was coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| I have seen a lot of different businesses who have utilized this outdoor media to increase their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=90)|
| 0:01:37| Every automobile that drives through Knox County has money in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| How are we going to get those folks to pull off the interstate, and I'm not for clutter by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| but I am saying that we're talking about an industry, and so I think that it is prudent for us to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| Let's really analyze it, and let's take a look at it before we just unilaterally say no more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| because I think that we need to look at how these businesses who utilize these are going to be able to function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| and also, as I said, we've had these for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| and a number of people, both profit and non-profit, utilize these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| So I will support the 60 days, and I believe that we need to have maybe one or two hearings on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=134)|
| 0:02:21| to give everyone ample opportunity to present their case. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Yeah, I just want to make a comment, because we've received some emails about how this would hurt business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| and this is not a ban on billboards. This is a ban on new billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| and I would like to remind everyone that the city of Knoxville has had a ban for the last 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| Also, we need to include in that discussion about the digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| and the digital billboards, of course, these bright ones that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| I think they can put six or eight of those things up there a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| We're talking about hurting employment, because a guy can sit down in Atlanta and change these things up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| One man can manipulate every billboard that we have if they're digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| rather than hiring local people to climb up there and do the work of maintaining them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| and changing them around as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| But I think it is worthwhile to have all of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| but I did want people to know that the city of Knoxville has had a ban on all new billboards for the last 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| The motion on the floor is to defer for 60 days. Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| Just a quick question. Do you want MPC to sponsor these hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| or do you want to set it up as a commission hearing? Just need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| I'd like to see us set it up as a commission hearing, since we're going to be the ones that have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| We need your help in setting them up. If you'll give us your assistance in setting them up, it'll be a commission hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you. Are we looking at at least two, or one, or two? I'd like to see at least two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And we'll get those properly noticed, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| So the motion on the floor is to defer for 60 days. All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Pardon me, we have how many noes? We have two noes. Yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| I was just going to ask, I didn't know if anyone wanted to speak at this time on it before we cast a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=250)|
| 0:04:18| We've already voted, so it's going to be deferred for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| If you'd like, we can hear anyone that wants to speak and give them three minutes, or we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Would anyone like to speak on it now, or wait until we have our public hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| We'll wait until the public hearings, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Okay, so it is deferred for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| We have a rezoning request of Scott Williams. If it's okay, could we go to that one first, and then we'll go to the hillside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| So Mr. Williams here. Clerk, if you'd read it into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Request of Scott Williams for rezoning from PR, planned residential, and RB, general residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| to A, agricultural property located southside O'Clinton Park, northeast side Meredith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| The applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| Sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Make a motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Any questions? If not, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| It passes. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Request of Knox County Commission and Knoxville City Council to review the hillside and ridgetop protection plan dated November 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=323)|
| 0:05:32| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| I'd like to make a motion to approve, but I think we need to make a change on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| because when this amendment was placed there for us to vote on, the city had not voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| And if you look at the middle portion of this, it says the amendment to the Knoxville-Knox County plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| I'd like to drop the reference to Knoxville, and down there a little later it says on future land decisions by the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=352)|
| 0:06:02| I'd like to drop that since that doesn't, it's not pertinent here any longer, and the city board of zoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| I'd like to drop that part simply because those references are all to the city of Knoxville, which has passed it separately from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| And I'd like to make a motion to approve with those changes, just dropping the references to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| I would like to make a substitute motion, that being the plan as we reviewed without Dr. Briggs' amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=389)|
| 0:06:39| So that's my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Motion has been made and seconded for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| So the substitute motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| We have one person who has asked to speak to this, if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Robert Hill from the Sierra Club has asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| And I guess I'll, sorry, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| I guess I would direct this to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| We've had a long time to look at this document and see the iterations and go to mediation and have facilitators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=440)|
| 0:07:31| The document as it stands without this amendment, does it, is this document advisory in nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=451)|
| 0:07:41| As it sits right now without the Briggs amendment, is this document, this plan advisory in nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| Well, the plan that came back to you from MPC without recommendation contains the Briggs amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Well, prior to the Briggs amendment, was that plan advisory in nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Absent that, the original plan without the Briggs amendment, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| It would not have been advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| It would have been compulsory, mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| The Briggs amendment served to make it advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| Now you have a substitute motion to go back to the original plan, which would make it mandatory, not advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| That's the substitute motion, if I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| What we are discussing here this evening is the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| We have had many hours talking about the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| So I'm going to ask that our comments be relegated toward the amendment or lack of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| So, Mr. Hill, if you'd like to address this, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Thank you, Chairman Amin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| I'm Robin Hill, and I represent the Sierra Club here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| I also represent myself as a citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| I live at 11504 Mountain View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934 in Commissioner Briggs' district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=538)|
| 0:09:07| and in the district of the two at-large commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| I've thought a lot about this amendment, both personally and for the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| I think I'm speaking for approval of the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| because I strongly believe that Dr. Briggs' amendment will make this really good document a lot weaker than it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=564)|
| 0:09:35| I listened to Dr. Briggs' comments the other day in his last meeting in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| It seems that his comments relate to and refer to the risk that somebody will sue about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=581)|
| 0:09:52| So the amendment he has proposed is one I presume that he thinks will minimize the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=592)|
| 0:10:02| But I thought about that a little bit with respect to myself and Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| I've been in a business all my working life that has lots of risk in it, the nuclear power industry, the nuclear industry, lots of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=609)|
| 0:10:18| We've taken those risks and successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Dr. Briggs, as Colonel Briggs went to Iraq and he knew the risk of that adventure for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=622)|
| 0:10:33| not adventure, but venture, and knew that he could get blown away by an IED in a second, a nanosecond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| But he wanted to put his talents to work there where they were needed to give people more life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| He was willing to take that risk, a big risk which lots of people wouldn't be willing to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| While I was thinking about that, I thought about the parable of the talents which appears in Luke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=655)|
| 0:11:04| One servant was given one talent, one servant was given five talents, one servant was given ten talents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| The one who had one buried his talent and gained nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| The one who had five and ten used their talents to grow and make them larger and do more with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=679)|
| 0:11:30| The more talents they had, the more they did, apparently, from the biblical story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| I think this situation is sort of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| If we don't pass this substitute amendment, and with all due respect to Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| the amendment will be adopting the amendment or adopting the plan with Dr. Briggs' amendment in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=707)|
| 0:11:57| will be the equivalent of burying the talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| And no good will come of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| And I think for the people of this county and for you folks who are commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=722)|
| 0:12:10| you'll look at this in some future time and if it's passed without that amendment in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| without the Briggs amendment, and be proud of what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| I agree it's a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Everything you do when you take a vote involves a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| I've been sitting in your seats and I didn't ever see a single vote that didn't have some kind of risk in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=746)|
| 0:12:35| But I would urge you to think about the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| the 462,000 of them who Commissioner Hammond and Mr. Shouse represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| the rest of you represent about 40,000 citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Think about those citizens and the people who the organizations that would like to have Dr. Briggs' risk stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=771)|
| 0:13:03| represents 2,000 or 3,000 people in three industries or three organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=783)|
| 0:13:11| the realtors, the home builders, and the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| Now, those folks have a right to their view just as I have a right to mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| and you all have a right to yours and when you make the vote, it's yours only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| and I'll respect the vote that you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| But I think we are at a juncture here that if we don't approve this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| and substitute motion that Commissioner Norman has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| we'll bury our talent for a very good plan and we won't get any benefit out of it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| So with those remarks, I'll retire, not ever say anything about this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| and I appreciate your tolerance and the ability to come down here and speak in a free forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| It's the greatest country in the world when we can do this and be listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Commissioner Briggs, would you feel comfortable explaining what I've heard you explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| in Duly Sunshine meetings about the appeal process and what brought you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| I won't say the full circle is the phrase, but there was talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| some constituents were there, the meeting you sunshined with Tony up in the conference room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| and I came by and that some sentences were to be deleted from your paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| but then you felt uncomfortable after, I guess, further analysis that because of Tennessee code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| it's sort of splitting hairs, but I know it's very technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| but your fears of what a judge may or may not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| I'm sorry if I'm putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| If you don't want to elaborate on it, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| but I'd like to hear that explanation from you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| You know, what it is, it gets into such a sort of legal and technical detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| and matter of opinion that I almost hate to even go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| but what it all comes down to is throughout all the process that we've had with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| I have not asked for one change to the Hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| I think as an advisory non-bounding plan, it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| It means that we have to look at every development and see is this something we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| or that we don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| The problem that I had that was pointed out to me initially by an attorney that was for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| that were against the plan was that if you look at the Tennessee code annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and I believe it's 13-3-303, it gets down to the words should and shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=956)|
| 0:16:05| And what's been explained to me is that shall says that you will do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| and that if in the Tennessee code annotated they used the word shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| it was very, very clear what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| It would be binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| It would mean that the NPC and anybody would have to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| and not really have a lot of deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| It does not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| It uses the word should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Now, remember the word shall also, like I mentioned once before, it's a double-edged sword.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| What it means is that if the NPC comes to a decision according to the strict reading of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| that is for or in favor of a developer, it would mean that the, and it's binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| it would mean that a citizen's group would lose the opportunity to appeal that to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| or the Board of Zoning Appeals if it was a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| And really the only recourse would be to take that through the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| which we all know gets very expensive and very time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| The word should can have different meanings depending on how courts look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| It's fair to say, and I really am getting, you know, this is getting to be a legal argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| I'm a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| But the word should, the word should means that usually would give you the leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| to refer this through an appeals process to an appeal board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| which would either be the Board of Zoning Appeals or the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| But if this thing got carried through the courts where someone decided to challenge it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| now I don't know if they would or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| and if the court said should is interpreted as shall, both citizens and the development community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1062)|
| 0:17:52| both of those sides would lose the opportunity to appeal this either to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| or Board of Zoning Appeals, and it would have to go through the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| which gets very time consuming and very expensive if you get involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| And if the courts, they probably would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| But if you look statistically at what happens, should can be interpreted as shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Usually it's not, but it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| And if that happened, we would lose, it would become binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| You would lose your right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| All the intent is of this amendment is to make it clear to a court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| because of that Tennessee Code 13-3-303, that we want the citizens, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| whoever has an objection to a finding of the NPC to retain that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| to refer it to an accountable body, which is the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| And then let us look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| We don't always have to follow the letter of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| We can look at this and we can say that, yes, it doesn't fit the plan, but it's a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| A developer would have to make his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| It would be denied by the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| He would have to come to us and make his case and persuade us that this is good going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Likewise, you can have a bad plan that fits the hill slopes plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| that the citizens would have the right to come to this and say, yes, it fits the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| but we think this is a bad idea and we would have a chance to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| And that's the purpose of putting this in, is to retain that right for citizens, business people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1165)|
| 0:19:34| developers to come to us and have to make their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| That's the purpose and that's the argument I'm using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| It's sort of a legalistic argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| It gets down to what does should mean and what does shall mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| I woke up this morning thinking about hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| This has really been my honor to take this up because of obviously with somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1203)|
| 0:20:13| if somebody like many people have in our community, they have a vision for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| and Knox County that's a little bit different from possibly the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| a pure business approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And so, you know, this is my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| It's been my thing for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| I probably, it's probably somewhere around, I saw John Grease back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| somewhere around 1982, somewhere in there, and I think John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| were you at Farragut High School in 82?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| I think John and I were teachers at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| And I think my ideas started to formulate then about the importance of these spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| these God-given spaces that we have in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| these streams and hills and how they're interrelated and all that ecology stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| And it was my pleasure to teach that and have fun with it in class and with kids and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1279)|
| 0:21:31| So, you know, those ideas, they apply to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1291)|
| 0:21:42| And there's a lot of people in this room that believe that our connected to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1302)|
| 0:21:52| our lack of or our loss of connectedness to the land has much to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| with maybe some of our maladies and diseases like childhood obesity and all types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1318)|
| 0:22:08| I just see these hillsides and these streams that are different in the county from in the city now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1328)|
| 0:22:18| Because in the city, we've had this, you know, we know what they're like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| The facts that we did not know what certain types of development did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| what their effects were on these natural areas, we know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Okay, but, and so really this is all sort of driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| my passion for the topic is driven around what I believe is ultimately good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1361)|
| 0:22:52| for our community long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| I mean, we've had writings about this in 1910 about the needs to plan our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| and our community around these physical assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| So now we know all of that and so that's what's driven this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| and my work on the task force and all these folks that have supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| And it's truly been my honor and pleasure to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1397)|
| 0:23:32| I'd do it ten times again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1412)|
| 0:23:46| And I do get emotional over this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| I think that these places are, they're refuges that we have to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1431)|
| 0:24:05| what they may mean to a kid that needs a refuge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1445)|
| 0:24:15| that streams and woods, books that are written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Last Child in the Woods and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| there's really a validity to that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| I'm going to go over, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Can I have a little more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Yes, sir, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you, John, for taking that off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| I just think that what we've done in our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1479)|
| 0:24:48| and I wrote all this stuff down this morning kind of wild and crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| like I do sometimes when I get up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| I greatly respect developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| I greatly respect builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| It's a wonderful house that an architect designed and a builder built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1507)|
| 0:25:20| I'm trying to understand Dr. Briggs' argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| and I do somewhat, that he's concerned about this judicial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1524)|
| 0:25:37| I just see it as we have our protections in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| We know we can amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| We know we have an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Why are we going all the way over to the court system to try to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| have some kind of insulation from what some judge might do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| That's a bizarre stretch to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| This is just, I know it's like, where are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| Are we going to have a binding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Is this going to be a binding plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Is it a non-binding plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Is there a risk in both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| We're at this critical point in the development of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| We're going to prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| What are we going to retain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| And the guys in the back, the developers in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| that they may do a lot better job than what we've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| and I hope they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| And we've got some protections in place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| But these spaces are special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| And when they're gone, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| We had a thing about mitigation of a stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| and they had I don't know how many millions per linear foot or something crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| I mean, it's just bizarre to try to mitigate something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| So, you know, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| And I just think that it's unnecessary for us to have this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1638)|
| 0:27:27| It's a critical point in time where we can say development's going to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| but we've got a group of people that we call planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| that really need to be more in charge of this process than they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| And we feel like that plan, this plan, puts them in the game in a significant way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| and it allows us to go in a new direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| It's a new direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| It's an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| So I hope that you'll vote for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| And again, I'm honored to have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| We have a substitute motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| and that substitute motion on the floor is to approve without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| We'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1709)|

| 0:28:42| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1727)|

| 0:28:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Commissioner Wright passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Commissioner Brown votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Commissioner Hammond votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Commissioner Shouse votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Not to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1750)|
| 0:29:20| Vote is 7 no, 3 yes, 1 pass, substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| We're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Commissioner O'Brien?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Since we have the original motion still up there, I'd like to propose another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1768)|
| 0:29:40| That is that we adopt the plan with the kinder, gentler version proposed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| We have a substitute motion that the MPC language be incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Are we talking about what Commissioner Norman brought to us last Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| Is that what you're talking about, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| I have a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I thought the MPC brought this back to us with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Well, but there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| It was Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| It wasn't Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| It wasn't formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| If I could clarify, Commissioners, there's a distinction between the MPC and the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| The MPC body sent it back no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| The staff recommended an alternative statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| So that is a staff recommendation, not an MPC body recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| That's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Does everyone know that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Could you read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| I think we saw it last week, but if someone could read it, I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| Do you have it, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I'll have the clerk read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Well, first of all, do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| We have copies of that, if that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Could you pass those around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| If you could, as she reads that into the record, would you track it to ensure it's congruent with yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1860)|
| 0:31:12| Purpose of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Land use plans are intended to provide a general guide for land use activities over an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| This plan is advisory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Its principles, objectives, policies, and guidelines provide a basis for the consideration of local government staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission in making land use and zoning recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| and, in turn, for the use of the legislative bodies in making decisions on those same cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| It is recognized that this plan is a guide for decision making and is not regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| All appeal processes regarding zoning, use on review, and subdivision cases remain unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| As is the practice with the adoption of all countywide plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| the provisions of this plan supersede relevant policies of the general plan and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1919)|
| 0:32:10| Mr. Brown, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| You know, I just want to make a statement about this, is that the problem, like I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| deals with the Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| And this doesn't address this because we may have, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| and this has been the opinion of what I call disinterested, uninvolved lawyers who don't even live in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| that the potential conflict is with the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| Because if these things are made part of the plan, then the Tennessee Code annotated could become involved with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1960)|
| 0:32:49| could be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| And that's the whole purpose of that second sentence dealing with the Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| because I didn't have a lot of problems with this otherwise as long as it was followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| But if this thing gets referred to a judge and the judge reads strictly according to Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| then you could particularly have the problems that I won't go through again about it being binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| And that's just my, you know, that was the whole purpose of putting the rest of that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| And I'll just make a comment as we, I think we're really back to where we are before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| even though we're stating this, is that if you interpret the Tennessee law strictly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| which this is not addressed in the Hill Slopes plan, we could run into the same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| And I'll leave it at that and then everybody can make their own decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| You know, as I, over the last week, looked at this rewrite, I can't help but to think this accomplishes what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2018)|
| 0:33:50| As I count one, two, three, four, five references in one paragraph to be an advisory or as a guide, this does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2030)|
| 0:34:04| We're not lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| I don't think we have a lawyer on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Lawyers sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| I think we make decisions every day that would put us up to some strange, unrealistic lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2052)|
| 0:34:21| I think this phrasing is extremely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| This is a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| This is a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| This is a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| This is a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| This is a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Five times it says that in a paragraph that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| So what I think it does do is allow the MPC staff to present this as a guide but to say, hey, this is a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2074)|
| 0:34:48| And that they can have something to say that stands up and say, well, you can take it or leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| Yes, a guide, but there's some great things in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| And I think Commissioner Briggs has commented on the fact, both here and some of the Sunshine meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| that he doesn't have a problem with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| I don't have a problem with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I don't think any of us have a problem with the plan because we've been to exhaustive meetings dealing with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| and vetting the plan out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I just think this accomplishes what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Does it make us bulletproof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Depends on what caliber you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| I do think this will withstand a legal challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| Neither of us are lawyers, so we're equally unqualified in our positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| But I just think this really does, I think it gives the developers what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| Look, this isn't something that I have to have to build to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| but it does allow the plan to go forward as something that people should take a strong look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2153)|
| 0:36:03| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| You know, I've said from the beginning I thought that the plan was overreaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| and I think we should have some, I think the 2033 plan takes care of the issues that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2172)|
| 0:36:22| And the reason I say that, somebody handed out, I don't know who handed it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| but there's a newspaper article from January 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Although the headline was meant to sell papers, it's actually false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| It says NPC approves first project under hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| Well, this project doesn't have a hillside plan because it's out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| And the reason, I think it helps my argument about it being individual parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| or land on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| And Buzz and I have had conversation about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| and I really don't want to get too deep into the conversation we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| because there's still some things I think we can work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| We're talking about a 10-acre piece of property that sits adjacent to an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| that's a luxury apartment complex that was built, I don't know, 2005, maybe 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2229)|
| 0:37:19| It's 97% full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| It's on a five-lane, well, it's really four lanes and a median on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| It's a state spent millions of dollars to improve because of the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| And, you know, he went to the NPC, wanted to add more apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| NPC gave him five units per acre, which is not apartments, it's condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| And so the staff recommended five an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| The NPC board gave him 12 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| There's still some ways to work within the topography, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| that NPC is talking to the developer about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| And there's some things that can be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| But this, I guess going back to this, this makes my, I feel like this makes my argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| that each parcel should be individual under the 2033 plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| because I think the process is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| You know, there is different topography on one lot versus the other lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Not to say that this is a flat piece of property, but it would look very nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| and it would be the same elevation and same buildings as the one right beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| So I think that goes to my argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| And, you know, me voting for the plan with the amendment to me is a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| because I think the 2033 plan suffices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| And so I don't think the other plan is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| with the new TDEC rules that have come out in the last half decade or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| and also the 2033 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| And that's why to me this is a compromise for me to vote with the Briggs amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| because I wish the plan would not go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you, Mike, for making this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| I think it's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| I agree with Sam that this states again and again and again that this is a general guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| advisory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| It says that several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| And I think what's most important to me, and I understand your argument, Rick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| but I go back to the meeting we had, Sunshine Meeting Friday, when we were discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| And I have to take issue with the research that you were presented with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| on how many times the courts interpret shall or should one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| I'm not comfortable with the way that that research was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| So I have a hard time relying on that as a basis for making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| However, one of the things that I like best about this is that this is not an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| that was made by the Hillside-Ridgeside Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| It's not an amendment made by Dr. Briggs or by the Knox Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| It's an amendment that was made by MPC staff who are going to be tasked with using this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2434)|
| 0:40:45| I think we've been very clear about what everyone's concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And I think that MPC staff put this alternative statement together to satisfy everyone's anxieties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2449)|
| 0:41:00| or alleviate everyone's anxieties and still allow the plan to do what it needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| So I appreciate everyone's desire to try to make something that was going to make everyone happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| I think that MPC staff has done the best job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| And that's why I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| The one thing that everyone needs to consider in this is this is, as Paul Harvey used to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| not the rest of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| The ordinances that will be written immediately upon adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| or they'll start on them immediately after the adoption of this, are what's going to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Those are the times, again, where both sides are going to need to sit down together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| okay, this works in that situation, this doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| We were told that the plan as it stood in the beginning said in it it was advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| Rather than have to sort through 68 pages to find those words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| we can take one short paragraph here and make that plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| I'm not like you, Emmy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I'm not comfortable with what things come out of the courts today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I'm skeptical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| I mean, sometimes I think they toss a coin and see which comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| Nothing against any of our local judges, but take it as you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| This is where we need to be working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| We need to be working on those ordinances because that is what's going to be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| This gives us the option of having that recourse, if it's needed, for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| And I think this is the smartest way for us to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| I was going to sit here quietly, and I prepared a statement, so I'm going to go ahead and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| As Knox County commissioners, there's only three things we can do with respect to revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| We can cut expenses, raise taxes, or increase the size of the tax base to reasonable growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| This is why we need to keep the Briggs Amendment for the hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| I have had concerned citizens tell me they're afraid of a loan review because of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| and ridgetop plan would change the use of their land, which is collateral for loans they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| Any change in the use of land triggers an automatic loan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Since land is worth less today than three years ago, that will trigger collateral calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| The Briggs Amendment prevents this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| As lawmakers, we have an obligation to do no harm to our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| This is a serious unintended consequence that the Briggs Amendment prevents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| I also have great concerns about our county tax base being devalued should the Briggs Amendment be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2629)|
| 0:43:57| Of the 138,000 acres of land under the hill and ridgetop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| how many potential new Gettysview subdivisions are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Gettysview is not only a beautiful development, but it's also a crown jewel in Knox County tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| It probably has more tax base value per acre than any development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| And Gettysview would not be possible under the hill and ridgetop plan the way it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| Water from the top of Gettysview rolls downhill to the lower parts of Gettysview without problem or incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| There have been no complaints of erosion, no scars on the land, no complaints of flooding basements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| Why would we as lawmakers want to prevent other Gettysviews from being developed in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| We need more developments like Gettysview to fund vital services like our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Of the 138,000 acres that fall under the hill and ridgetop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| are many acres of land zoned commercial or residential that will be reassessed at lower property taxes rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| due to a change in use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| When we devalue the tax base, we have to either cut expenses or raise property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2703)|
| 0:45:11| We can cut expenses more, but not nearly enough to prevent a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2711)|
| 0:45:20| Why in this poor economic time would we raise property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| The schools are underfunded by $7 million. The school board wants additional money beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| How can we fund our schools, law enforcement and libraries by reducing our tax base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| It makes no sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| People are calling me now worried that County Commission will increase property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| We have many people in Knox County that are in financial crisis now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| We have an obligation to do no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| It is our job to look for and find unintended consequences that can harm our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| Lastly, I believe that County Commission must be the last appeal before a court appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| MPC is not an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| This Hillside and Ridgetop Plan exceeds the statutory authority granted by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| by removing County Commission as the last appeal by an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| A binding Hillside and Ridgetop Plan removes the discretion of County Commission as the last appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| What is the point of coming to County Commission when our hands are tied by a binding plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| I believe that the Briggs Amendment is pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| We should vote this Hillside and Ridgetop Plan from MPC down as we did the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| Now is not the time to take risks that can harm Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2791)|
| 0:46:42| I'd like to ask our law director if you would explain the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2802)|
| 0:46:51| between Mr. Briggs' amendment and the amendment from the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| What is the difference in the wording of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| If I could, sir, if I could just back up for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| As you can imagine, as the law director, I have to look at these things for legal sufficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| So when I realize outside attorneys have called and they've issued opinions to some of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| but just a few things we have to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| First of all, the courts do definitively determine, make a distinction between should and shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| Our Tennessee courts have said should is advisory in nature, not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| On the converse, they say shall is mandatory and not discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| But the point is this, within the last week I've had two other attorneys call me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| who heretofore have not been involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| One threatened to file an injunction against the county if we pass the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| The other threatened to file an injunction against the county if we pass the alternative statement proposed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| Point being this, trying to find something that we could say is ironclad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| is going to be legal defensible is folly because regardless of how researched and how well we feel it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| a judge could very well disregard that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| So you do the best you can with what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| It gets down to wordsmithing, et cetera, but in terms of bringing this before a court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| this is what the most recent land use case that was litigated in the Court of Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| dealt with this very issue of challenges to a legislative body, a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| The court said this, legislative acts of a local government must be given their due deference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| Now this is in relation to land use matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| The court also said this, the court's primary resolve is to refrain from substituting its judgment for that of the local government body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| Both legislative and administrative decisions are presumed to be valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| and a heavy burden of proof rests on the shoulders of the party who challenges the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| The point is this, regardless of what you pass today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| to be able to say it is completely legal and it is challenge-proof is folly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| We just don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| In terms of the two plans, I think the biggest distinction is obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| and I think it's already been articulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| the Briggs Amendment is designed to ensure that it is a non-binding plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2940)|
| 0:49:09| that doesn't actually get subsumed to the general plan as law, meaning this, it's advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| which means if a landowner is given an opinion, they can either accept it or reject it, but they're not bound by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2955)|
| 0:49:23| The alternative statement, again, different wordsmithing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| but it doesn't bind the landowner either unless there's an intent there that I'm not seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| But the definitive distinction is the Briggs Amendment does make a point to demonstrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| that this is purely advisory in nature and you're not required to be bound by it if you're an affected landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2983)|
| 0:49:53| So with the election, I know you called for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| but I just want to get clarification here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| When it says the plan is advisory in nature, I'm talking about the MPC plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| and it says that it has recognized this plan as a guide for decision-making and is not regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| I guess we get back into wordsmithing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| Well, the argument would be, I presume, that because the Briggs Amendment reads specifically it's not binding on land use decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| and the MPC proposal does not use the term non-binding, an attorney would argue that it is binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| if you don't have that language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| That would be, I imagine, looking at it from the other side, that's what I would argue as a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| I'd say if it doesn't say it, then it's non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| But again, regardless of the possibility of this precipitating in the litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| considering all the staff reports and the incongruence between the staff, the MPC, the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| we'll most likely litigate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| But if this commission's actions are not arbitrary and capricious or fraudulent or illegal, we'll defend it, and we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| And so far, nothing this Board has done I think can be considered arbitrary, capricious, fraudulent, or illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| which is the standard the courts will look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Look at the third sentence in the alternative statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| Its principles, objectives, policies, and guidelines provide a basis for the consideration of local government staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| No, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| I'm just saying what people may argue, but I would just say the Briggs Amendment is more strongly slanted towards it being non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3087)|
| 0:51:38| The alternative statement isn't as affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| And again, I'm looking at this from syntax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| That's not a legal analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| That's a syntax analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Mr. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| The only difference is that one says non-binding and one says advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| It's pretty much exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| They both say that they're advisory, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Well, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| This is not a legal analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| It's syntax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| So either one, they both achieve the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| It's just whether you want to use the word advisory or you want to use the word non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| That I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| That's how a court would actually determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| A court may even otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Thank you about your points about the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| That's exactly the point that I was trying to make to Commissioner Briggs earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| I'll give us a break here for just a second while we think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| I would like to ask the staff the Knox New Sentinel story that came out saying this was about Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3155)|
| 0:52:44| What went wrong there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| What was the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| You'll have to ask the reporter from the Knoxville New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| Yeah, but I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| I've made my analysis of, well, I'm not going to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| It's in the city because the county hadn't passed the Slope and Ridge Protection Act yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| The general plan and the current sector plans already have a slope protection policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| It is not the same as what you're about to vote on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| We've had the current slope protection policy in place for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| But it is not, I repeat, it is not the same thing as put forth in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| So the recommendation made by staff and to some degree the recommendation made by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| was based on our current policy in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| So whatever reference made to the Hillside plan or by the article, that was totally incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3220)|
| 0:53:49| So we have a current plan or policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| Is that in code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| It's in a plan, which is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| So what we're taking up now is the adoption of this new plan, which is also advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| but you will be using it in making decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| And we'll be using it, if you could give me a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| Any decision that the Metropolitan Planning Commission makes with regard to future land use policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| on area-wide basis or parcel-by-parcel basis can be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3267)|
| 0:54:36| There is no decision that MPC makes that stands by itself as the final word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| that deals with rezoning applications, amendments to the sector plans, subdivision plots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| development plans that are reviewed by MPC and approved or recommended on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| All of those decisions, all of them can be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| A recommendation is at the basis of those until the appeal period for each one of those expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| There is an appeal period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| But every decision that the Metropolitan Planning Commission makes with regard to how land can be used in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3312)|
| 0:55:20| is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| That's how it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| That's how we've been treating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| I came on staff in 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| It hasn't changed in that number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| And it will be the same way tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| The Planning Commission is not set up to be, because we know, good point made about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| we know we're not the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| We are not the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| So anything that we do or say with regard to land use policy is advisory only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3347)|
| 0:55:56| unless there is a process in place where an appeal can be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| And appeals can be filed on everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| And that appeal period runs its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| If it runs its course, then that decision becomes final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| But everything that we can do can be appealed to somebody, whether it's the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| Knox County BZA, or this body here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| And Commissioner Wright, the policies that are in the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| and they're in 12 sector plans are pretty much the same in 11 of the 12 sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3386)|
| 0:56:34| The one exception was when we were doing East County sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| we were far enough along to know that there was a hillside and ridgetop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| that was a better method through GIS of identifying that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| And so that area is shown in the East County sector plan, as are the new policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| which are essentially the same as what you had worked through during the mediation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3416)|
| 0:57:06| And that's a perfect lead to what I was about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| There are an extreme number of issues in this plan that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| The use of technology at calculating slope and run and rise and fall and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| or the clustering of development, or the narrowing of roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| and reduction of setback on steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I've probably got one more in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Yeah, you've got to have a grading plan before you actually get to go skin to place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| But as some people may have noticed the last couple of votes of this, I've passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| because what I thought was happening is what I think I've arrived at, that it is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3467)|
| 0:57:58| It's like right now, it's not twilight outside, it's dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| Earlier today at noon, it was daylight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| This is just one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| It's either a plan, it is the plan, and you all use it for your recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| It does not matter if the ordinance is there to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| It is the plan by which you recommend to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Now, I always thought it was that way for the last couple of three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| and that's why I could not come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| It doesn't matter which way I vote on this particular plan for the last couple of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| because if everyone will remember, I voted in favor of it when it was first introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| I've only passed because I think people keep trying to insert the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| that makes us feel better about the advisory part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| Well, it's always been advisory, but it's also always been what you all recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| And therein lies my real rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| I have said this to several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| I need to see Metropolitan Planning Commission's thoughts and thought patterns be closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3549)|
| 0:59:18| or let me say it the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| I would like to see commission thought processes closer aligned with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| because you all are the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| The Metropolitan Planning Commission itself is a group of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| I don't want to see us get further apart in that you all go one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| and then we think it in our best interest to go in some other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| I know we've had like the restaurant at Fox Road Marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| I don't know who did what except I remember the bottom line was we didn't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| Now what it took us to get there, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| I just remember there's no restaurant there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| I'm still in a vast quandary, but I do now understand the last sentence of the alternative statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| The last sentence of the alternative statement is that this plan is what you all are going to use to gauge what comes to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3621)|
| 1:00:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| This plan will be used as the basis for our recommendation on zoning decisions to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3634)|
| 1:00:43| and in turn generally, but not always, is used as the basis for their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| which in turn is given to county commission or city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| I really appreciate the way you all were able to converse with me about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| because I thought that was where we were headed and I see now that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| I do know some of these things are in the East County Sector Plan, which I think should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| The only thing that we fussed about on the East County Sector was Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Go with me here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| I've got nine acres in Camberland Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| I have some slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Let's say that we pass the first amendment, which is the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| I come to you with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| I want to develop that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| For whatever reason, I don't agree with your staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| and I don't feel that the MPC has given me proper consideration and I want to appeal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| Under the Briggs Amendment, I could then come to the county commission or the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| I'm in the county, so I could bring it back before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| The rezoning would come automatically to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| Hold on. Let me think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| The rezoning would come to you and you could act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| If it required a plan amendment, then that would go through the process where we would bring it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| and if you felt inclined that the plan amendment should be approved over MPC's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| then you would initiate the plan amendment process so that in the end result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| the plan as you amend it would be in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| It would not stop at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Now, there's a process to work through that and you've all used that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| That's what you did with this plan toward the latter stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| You initiated your own plan that came back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| and that's what the commission decided to provide no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| So the end result is a plan amendment and rezoning can end back in your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| to make a decision that you see to be the proper decision with all that you have to deal with as elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| So with that same scenario, I come in and we pass the alternative statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| What is the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| In terms of that particular process, there is no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| I guess the issue we have with the other portions of the alternative statement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| it's written such that we're just not sure of the status of some of our other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| It kind of makes us a little nervous about what do we have with regard to our other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3813)|
| 1:03:42| Honestly, as a staff member, I'm not speaking for the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| we don't think either statement is needed because we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| and we went through the process of cleaning up the document to make it as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| to do whatever we could to make sure that it was considered an advisory document, a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| Any plan that we produce, again, is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| It's a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| It's not regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| So in doing that, we were comfortable that we had something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| and a lot of that came out of that process that you and the council went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| We thought we had something that, yes, this is something that is clearly advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| although we've always felt like it was advisory, but now it's clearly advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| It's a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| And it could go forward as such and still be like the sector plans we adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| All of them are advisory and are guides for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| The general plan, our parks and recreation plan, our transportation plan, all of them are guides and advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3889)|
| 1:04:59| Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| So I want to make sure that I've got this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| Both of these are redundant in saying that the plan is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| Some of us already acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| But you said that the Briggs Amendment could call into question perhaps some of the other plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| that you all have at MPC that you use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Well, in one sentence it says it amends the general plan, but at the very end of that sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| it says just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| You know, it should not be considered an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| So what, you know, with all due respect to Dr. Briggs, I respect him very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| But the essence of that first statement, you know, is very problematic in terms of what does it really mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3943)|
| 1:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| So if we're going to have a redundant statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| it's best to have one that does not call into question the other plans that you all work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| We have a substitute motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| and that substitute motion is to approve the alternative statement provided by the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| We'll do a roll call vote, and let's begin in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3978)|

| 1:06:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Commissioner Owenby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=3990)|

| 1:06:50| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4010)|
| 1:07:03| The vote is six no, four aye, one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| The substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| We're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| The original motion is with the First Amendment, the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| Roll call vote, first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Did you want to speak, Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| In light of what MPC just mentioned, I think we need to have a little more clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| about what this means in relation to the other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| If this is going to perhaps cause a problem, that's something that I think we should be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4055)|
| 1:07:49| Would Dr. Briggs be willing to adjust language in this to prevent problems with the plans that MPC has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| Or is it that big a deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| Or does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| At the end of the day, MPC staff and the Planning Commission are going to work with whatever you all approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4087)|
| 1:08:15| We'll work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| We'll do the best job we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| We think, and again, all due respect to Dr. Briggs in this statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| we're not sure of the status of the general plan as it relates to this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| We're not sure of the status of what were called related sections in some of our other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| We just think if you're going to choose a statement, the alternative statement would have been more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| But be that as it may, in the final analysis, we'll work with whatever is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| as is always the case and always has been and always will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| We'll start in the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Did someone else want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| The other aspect that we felt on the Briggs amendment was that the growth policy plan has policies on hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4140)|
| 1:09:15| development in the rural areas, which are 61 percent of the hillside area in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4155)|
| 1:09:24| The growth policy is part of the framework in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| The legislative bodies by themselves cannot change the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| That has to be done through a call from the county mayor to reconvene the coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4176)|
| 1:09:45| and have them meet and have Farragut, City of Knoxville, and Knox County agree on a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4185)|
| 1:09:56| That being said, and Mr. Jarrett may want to speak to this, it may be wise to have language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4196)|
| 1:10:05| if you're going to continue down this path, referencing that it doesn't apply to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4205)|
| 1:10:13| Commissioner Briggs, were you aware of this as part of your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| Or did you work with MPC staff at all to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| You know, the only comment I have to say about this, I mean, this is really getting into some legal issues right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| If that were the case, why did the MPC not send this back in this direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| I mean, there was an opportunity for the MTC commission to review all this, to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| And I'm really not pointing any fingers at all because if that really were a concern, why did the MPC not tell us this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4238)|
| 1:10:46| Why did the MPC come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Well, actually, I think they did when the MPC staff sent the alternative statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| I'm not talking about the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| It may be very legitimate what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| I'm talking about what the MPC did, the MPC commission that's the appointed commission that votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| And, you know, I mean, this is getting into such complex legal issues right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| But if this was really a major concern, it should have come back to us with the MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| It did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| It came back with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Mr. Law Director, would you please comment on the MPC staff's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| Let me just say, you know, the answer to this is I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| But I do have to depend upon the wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| We always talk about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| You know, we say we've got to respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| We've got to respect these people that give their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| What came back to us from the MPC commission in respect to that was no comment, no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4306)|
| 1:11:55| Well, it wasn't no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| It was no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| They did not come back with a recommendation to change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| They did not come back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| And, you know, to answer your question, I mean, really, Amy, to answer your question, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| I mean, this is getting to be a real detailed, you know, legal argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| Do I want to make, you know, do I want to throw a monkey wrench into something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| If we change a little bit of something, I don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| But all I know is what the MPC commission came back to us with, and it was with no recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| And was this discussed at the MPC meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Was this concern raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Yes, Mr. Donaldson brought that to the attention of the commission, and that's part of your minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| So, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Well, Mr. Donaldson made that argument to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| They still sent it back without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| The growth policy plan can't be changed, even, I mean, especially when you have this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| I know it's troubling for planners, perhaps, and I'm not making light of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| But when you've got a non-binding plan, it can't serve to be contrary to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| So this can't have the effect of changing the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| I mean, again, you know, this is a hyper-technical legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| It's not one that's been litigated in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I can't start citing you case law or black letter law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| But what a court will look like is what was the intent of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| The intent appears to be to have a non-binding plan that's advisory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| That it's not designed to change the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| It's not intended to be non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| And that's what a court's going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| At the end of the day, they're going to get, you know, an attorney who litigates this is going to get the commission minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| The court will then look at the deliberation of the deliberating body and say what was their intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| And from there, you know, one judge may look at it and say, I think their intent was other than that which is stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| but, you know, if you're going to go down this path, this is clearly a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| But I can't give you every possible scenario that will occur, you know, once it's formalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| Motion on the floor is to approve with the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part3?start=4443)|
