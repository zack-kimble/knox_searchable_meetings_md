| 0:14:39| Congratulations, Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| So that concludes our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Do we have public forum, Miss Kotny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| We have one speaker for public forum, Robert Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| And Mr. Cole, if you'll come to the podium and state your name and county of residence for the record, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=895)|
| 0:15:03| My name is Robert Cole, and I am a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| I'm here today due to an incident that happened on the half day, which was that my child's school, and I understand the majority of other Knox County schools, were served sack lunch peanut butter sandwiches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=907)|
| 0:15:24| I, to be clear, am not advocating for banning of peanuts in schools, but per the guidance that was sent out for peanut products in school cafeterias earlier this year, it discusses that some various things that you need to do and developing plans and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=924)|
| 0:15:47| And we actually had worked out a very good plan, I thought, with the school, with my child's teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| Mr. Eric Moore is a fantastic advocate for my son, who has a severe peanut allergy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| And that plan seemed to be working quite well for the first week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| And once we got to the first half day, I got a bit of a panicked call from Mr. Moore that he did not realize until day of that they were serving peanut butter sandwiches and that they were being distributed to the classrooms to be eaten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=962)|
| 0:16:15| I did a bit of an informal poll on Facebook with some various parent groups, and it sounded like the majority of other schools had done the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=975)|
| 0:16:23| Some select schools, at least five, had served soy butter sandwiches that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| So I think that's a reasonable thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| I think it's reasonable to be able to make accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| I want to also spend a moment backing up slightly to when we realized my son had a peanut allergy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=995)|
| 0:16:43| He was less than a year old, and I got a call while I was at work from my wife's phone that no parent wants to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| which is that it was one of my wife's friends calling to let me know that my son was being sent to Children's Hospital in an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| He had somehow ingested peanuts at a friend's house on a play date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| And luckily for him, he was about seven months old, we had EpiPens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| We had realized a couple of months prior that he had a peanut allergy due to my daughter taking a picture with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| and she'd been eating peanuts, and he ended up with an imprint of her hand on his arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| And when I got to the emergency room, the emergency room doctor told me something that really just has sat with me since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1041)|
| 0:17:31| which was that my wife wins Mom of the Year award because normally when children come to the emergency room at his age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| it doesn't end this way, because she was able to administer an EpiPen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| she was able to get him to the hospital in an ambulance, and they were able to do all the things that they needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| So I'm not here, again, to advocate that we ban peanuts, but just that something be standardized amongst the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1070)|
| 0:17:58| and that we don't expect that out-of-the-blue peanut butter sandwiches get distributed to hundreds of students and sent all around the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1078)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1087)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you very much, Mr. Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1099)|
| 0:18:28| Yes, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Dr. Roswick, I know I got a lot of feedback about this when it was first announced at the beginning of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| and I don't know that we've addressed it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Can you speak to Mr. Cole's concerns specifically around, on days that we don't have a normal calendar within the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| a normal schedule, what the expectation and the policy is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| or what we might need to do to maybe shift that if we're just offering peanut butter sandwiches to kids who don't need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Okay, Brett's not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| There's probably one that we would have her kind of address in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| I think we weren't necessarily ready for that question from that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| But I do know that it may be something that Mr. Myers, maybe you speak to on food allergy, like it's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| I don't mean to throw you, but I think you have some knowledge of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| and it might help on just overall what we do for that kind of food allergy on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you, Dr. Reiswig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Yeah, so I would hope that when we have these allergy situations that families have been able to work with the school-based team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1168)|
| 0:19:37| to conduct an S-team and then develop a 504 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| That's the surest way to ensure that an individual student is going to get those needed accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| even as it relates to a health concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| We've really moved in the last probably three years away from the old model of using a health plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| and really trying to ratify it around something much more formal like a 504 plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| so that we can have those individualized accommodations for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| So hopefully, if those pieces are in place, we'd be able to avoid something like the example given tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| where the entire classroom is given that peanut butter sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Obviously, the student with the peanut allergy cannot eat that peanut butter sandwich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| and it sounds like it's even more extreme than that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| So I would encourage any family to work with their school-based team to develop an appropriate 504| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| to ensure that we have accommodations in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I think it would be good for Brett to send out something to the board detailing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| especially on off-schedule days because, again, I know I've got a lot of questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| I don't know if the rest of you all did from your district, but from families who just have concern about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| better prepare us to be able to help them in that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| So having moved through the agenda, no more public forum, correct, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220914?start=1264)|
