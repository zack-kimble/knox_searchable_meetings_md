| 2:22:55| And that's because I went to Alaska on a trip that I had planned for for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8575)|
| 2:23:00| But that's the only meeting I have missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| And the situation we are, since we're elected officials, we owe it to the people that we represent to try to take care of ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8583)|
| 2:23:12| not get out and ride jet skis or ski down these slopes and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8592)|
| 2:23:22| Well, I mean, if you want to do that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| But you have to take personal responsibility for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| And I've seen Mr. Daley come in here on a sled of some sort and trying to get him back and forth to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8610)|
| 2:23:40| So it's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| But if we're supposed to have open meetings by state law, we should have open meetings and we should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| And then, as you say, go down the slippery slope, what is a medical emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| So, anyway, I'm just making my points heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| If I could, just reflecting on my years on the Board of Education that is allowed to have a member participate remotely for medical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8639)|
| 2:24:15| I would like to think that as an elected body, anybody is responsible enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| and conscientious enough that they certainly would not take advantage of this type of privilege that might be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8660)|
| 2:24:30| I can say on our Board of Education, it did not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8670)|
| 2:24:36| I mean, we had situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| We had one that she was still in the hospital, she had just given birth, you know, that chose to participate remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8680)|
| 2:24:47| We had another situation, a sitting board member who had just had cancer surgery was still in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8687)|
| 2:24:55| Most of us are so eager to be a part and participate that we would even go to those kind of extremes to participate if we had the privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8695)|
| 2:25:05| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| Crazy question scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| What if you had two people in the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| Who do you decide who gets to zoom in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| The Chair will not entertain that discussion at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| Madam Clerk, 53 has been moved at the request of the sponsor to be discussed next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8727)|
| 2:25:33| So, next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| This is item number 54, discussion item regarding the state legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| I just wanted to bring this up to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| This is the time of year in which we really should be engaging with our state legislative officials on priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8743)|
| 2:25:51| on things that, as Knox County, we want to see them work on in the upcoming session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| In years gone past, we've sort of waited until the last minute and tried to have a meeting or a luncheon with them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| 48 hours before they walk into session, which every one of them I've talked to have said is way too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| We need to be discussing things with them in October and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| And so this is just sort of an open forum of, and I'll look to Commissioner Schoonmaker to kind of lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8771)|
| 2:26:17| as he's the head of the Legislative Affairs Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| but sort of bringing it up that we all need to get on the same page and do it probably in the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8780)|
| 2:26:26| I have reached out to the legislative delegation, Den Leader, with Seniority Senator Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8786)|
| 2:26:34| to find out what best way we could do that in a productive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| But Commissioner Schoonmaker, if you'll lead it from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| The members of the Legislative Affairs Committee are Commissioners Lundy, Commissioner Durrett, Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8802)|
| 2:26:50| and Commissioner Daley, who's the vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| And just if you'll let me know at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| I'd like to see if we can't meet this next Wednesday, October 28th at 4 o'clock, to go over what we've discussed here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8817)|
| 2:27:05| There's some carryover items that we're going to push forward this year again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| And just to give you a quick update on the sales tax administration fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| I did represent that to the lieutenant governor last week, again, to bring it to his attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8836)|
| 2:27:24| because certain individuals know how long we've been working on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| But hopefully if we can get some help from some others across the state, that should work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8848)|
| 2:27:35| One of the other things that has come up is that the state legislature mandates what the beer board application fee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8855)|
| 2:27:47| and what the beer privilege tax is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| And both of those items have not been changed in about 20 to 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| The current application for the beer board is $250, and then the beer privilege tax is $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8876)|
| 2:28:04| So there's been some discussion that possibly presenting that again, but again, it would be up to the Legislative Affairs Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8884)|
| 2:28:12| if they feel like that's something that we need to work with some of our colleagues across the state to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| Because particularly when you look at things that haven't been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| Another thing that I'd like to see us change is that, and this is again on a statewide level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8901)|
| 2:28:36| the problem with Tennessee having 95 counties and the vast majority of them in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8916)|
| 2:28:46| some of those rules and regulations don't apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| One of the things that has come to the attention for the larger counties is that we don't have the ability to raise a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8929)|
| 2:29:00| or a fine, excuse me, higher than $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| And Tennessee code annotated 5-1-211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8944)|
| 2:29:11| What they did was they said that any county that has a charter form of government that has over 700,000 population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8951)|
| 2:29:20| the legislative body by two-thirds vote could go ahead and raise that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| So I'd like to see that amended to maybe 300,000 so that some of our other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8967)|
| 2:29:34| Williamson County, Rutherford County, Hamilton County, some of those folks could also then change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8974)|
| 2:29:41| Because as Commissioner Daley has worked with on the littering, sometimes you've got that one fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8981)|
| 2:29:48| but there's other categories where you can't find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| Or if we have a stormwater issue, the developer can be just charged $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8991)|
| 2:29:58| So again, $50 in a county that only has 25,000 population, that's probably a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| But with the metro counties, that's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9005)|
| 2:30:10| So we may want to look at something like that to have that amended as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| But on the local, just for Knox County, nobody's really brought up an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9015)|
| 2:30:22| I know there's a couple of lights on already, but Commissioner Biggs, did you want to mention something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9022)|
| 2:30:29| I did. I had more of a question, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| Do you think that we might be able to get where the haul tax is that leaves this year, beginning of next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9032)|
| 2:30:40| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| Sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| Yeah, it's gone, gone away, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| So the impact it's going to have on us, as well as the impact that, like you just said, the census is going to have on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9045)|
| 2:30:52| Will there be more seats added federally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| Will there be more things done throughout the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| Kind of like a prediction of where the state sees us going in the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9057)|
| 2:31:02| So this time next year, or maybe at commission retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| we can get our heads together even further in advance for Legislative Affairs Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| and just kind of segue to the direction we want to go next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| because I feel like next year is going to be really, really big for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| Right, with redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| I will point out, too, that on your agenda electronically are the legislative priorities from last year that are on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| I think it would probably be a good thing to look and see are any of those still applicable and do we want to continue those on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| But that is essentially the format we're trying to get to. Is that correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| Commissioner Smith and then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| A couple of points and a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| Commissioner Scudamore, we've been working on the admin sales tax fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| so I'm not sure we need to use that as one of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| I think our state legislators, and I think you've done a great job of getting the other county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| throughout the state aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| And I think they're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| So I'm not sure if we need to make that a priority but just continue the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9134)|
| 2:32:15| A second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| On the beer board fee and renewal fee, have we looked at the fiscal note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| How much revenue would that generate for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| I mean, is it something really worth pushing an issue for if it doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| Well, it would depend on how much you wanted to increase it to would obviously make a difference on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9148)|
| 2:32:35| But then also you do have the ability to say, you know, if that went from $250 to, say, $400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9155)|
| 2:32:41| that you want to designate that $150 for X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| But we don't have a breakdown of the fiscal impact that would have at different variances of fee levels, fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9166)|
| 2:32:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| Well, I guess basically the feeling is that people who are applying for a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9175)|
| 2:33:01| and the ones that are paying the beer privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9181)|
| 2:33:11| Don't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| In other words, it could be updated, and I don't think you'd have anybody say they'd stop selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| No, they wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| But, I mean, is it going to be enough revenue for us to use as a, you know, they give us two, three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9200)|
| 2:33:28| They say, come to us with two, three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| Oh, I understand that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9210)|
| 2:33:31| No, this would be more of kind of just to say, hey, here's something else that's in the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| but Knox County can't lead the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| It's got to be a lot of other counties that would have to agree to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Because that's a statewide issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| That would not just, that would, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| I was just kind of bringing up some ideas of what other people had talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| And, you know, in the past we've always asked for appropriate funding in the Board of Education formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9230)|
| 2:33:59| And we're just, we're standing in a hurricane on that because there are 95 other counties that have us by numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9239)|
| 2:34:08| And they're never going to give up that piece of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| We're always going to be a donor community as long as we keep trying to make Knox County grow and get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9250)|
| 2:34:18| That kind of works against us, but I would sure like to see some kind of equalization happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9258)|
| 2:34:25| Two things that, you know, I don't think we've ever asked them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9265)|
| 2:34:33| We got a new gas tax, and in Knox County some of our biggest problems are our state roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| Emory Road, Washington Pike, North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| I think we can try to ask our legislators to really provide us some help with these state roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| that are actually the economic drivers of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| They want us to keep growing, to be able to supply and be a donor community to the rest of the school systems across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9291)|
| 2:34:58| They need to give us some tools to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| And our state roads, we could really use some help with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9301)|
| 2:35:06| Another thing is maybe we could get a profit act or an exemption from the State Board of Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9306)|
| 2:35:14| I've never understood why if somebody appeals their property taxes here they go to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9314)|
| 2:35:20| when the state doesn't collect any property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| It's enough skin off their back to grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| And you can ask Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| You can ask our Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9330)|
| 2:35:34| It has cost us over the last five, six years quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| That's my ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| Before I head over this way, I would like to point out when our last time we brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| or our last meeting where this came up, somebody, I can't remember who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| somebody on this body said that they can't remember a time one of our state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| actually ever did anything we asked them to do with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| So I might bring up the question, do we even need to go through this exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| Because we're all working on things individually with our state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| We want to have a good relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| Is this a futile process to give them a list every year and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| hey, here's the things that we think are priorities if they've never done anything on that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| I think out of respect for them and obligation to our constituents, we have to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9379)|
| 2:36:25| And it's usually a pleasant enough experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| It just doesn't usually yield a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| We have an early legislative meeting I think comes up in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| I don't know if we'll have it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| Have you heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| I assume, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| And we go down there and we have certain legislative priorities that we go down there and talk to them face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| But the one thing that you just talked about, you talked about roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| And I'm on the Transportation Committee and we're looking at the growth of electric cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9413)|
| 2:36:58| And they say by 2025, 50% of the cars on the road will be electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| And we get all of our money from gas taxes to do our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| And they are not acting right now on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| And like you say, they do sales tax, but they don't do property tax down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9430)|
| 2:37:16| They're not supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| And they give our money away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| And we gave big money away in Nashville last year, or a year before last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9439)|
| 2:37:25| when we had a lot of stores closed, these big box stores that closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| We gave away millions of dollars, or they did, and we had to suck it up and put it in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9450)|
| 2:37:36| And my question is, what we ought to ask them, isn't Shelby County, Shelby County is not a donor county, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9456)|
| 2:37:43| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| They receive about $75 million, and we give them, I mean, we give the state about $75 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| I think Mr. Caldwell could probably verify that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| So we ought to talk to them about why a big county like that, and like us, and we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| but we know that we're not going to be heard that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9482)|
| 2:38:06| But we need to look at these things for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| And when we receive, when we, and I put this before, and I've got feedback on it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9488)|
| 2:38:15| when we accept roads in this county, we accept liabilities for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9495)|
| 2:38:21| And since I've been on here, I know of about 50 miles of road that we have accepted for future, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9501)|
| 2:38:31| that we're going to have to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| And we're not putting that in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| So we're not planning for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| So we're going to have road problems down the road, and I don't know how we're going to face it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| but we need our legislators to start right now figuring out a way so we're not hit with additional property tax some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9522)|
| 2:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| Mr. Caldwell, you want to answer that question before I start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9533)|
| 2:38:59| I don't know if he heard it, but doesn't Knox County, we're a donor county of about $75 million, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9539)|
| 2:39:05| and Shelby County is a receiving county of about $75 million, even with all the federal dollars that they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9545)|
| 2:39:13| We've done that calculation before, and they make it hard to back into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| but I think at one point we were a donor of about $50 or $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| Now, of course, they're going to say that they put into state roads and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| But, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| Commissioner Daly, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9568)|
| 2:39:32| Chris, you might be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| We just approved the lobbyist for $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9575)|
| 2:39:40| What has that lobbyist done for us down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| Maybe we get the mayor to office to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| So I'd have to go back and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| We met with them a few weeks ago to go ahead and give them our priorities for this coming up legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9589)|
| 2:39:57| And so we could go back to see what we pushed for a year ago and what they were able to help with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| Has any of these priorities that you discussed a couple weeks ago, are we talking about the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9604)|
| 2:40:13| Yeah, I'd have to go back and look at what we went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| We do always bring up to them the sales tax administrative fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| We always, you know, we're talking about a mental health facility, so we talked about that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9624)|
| 2:40:34| That was actually talked about a year ago when COVID kind of just took it off the front line, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9634)|
| 2:40:43| And I'd have to go back and look at my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| I'll share the list with you all, what we shared with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| But ultimately, I mean, they have the ability to help us in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9651)|
| 2:40:58| I believe we'll be meeting November 9th, John, did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| He's hoping to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| No, October the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| No, the legislative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| Next 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| Yeah, that's next Wednesday at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| You may want to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| Looking over, you know, the priorities of the whole sales tax has gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| John had a great one, I think, for two years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| It's called the single article sales tax to where the state took away that half of what we could collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9681)|
| 2:41:30| Yeah, do you want me to give you a quick overview on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| Yeah, just if we can get that back, I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9692)|
| 2:41:39| because if you go buy a new car, we're only getting half of what we really should be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9699)|
| 2:41:44| So I think that ought to be one of our priorities on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| And I think we need to work closer with our lobbyists, you know, and so hopefully we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9708)|
| 2:41:55| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9715)|
| 2:41:56| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9716)|
| 2:41:57| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9717)|
| 2:41:58| If it's okay, Commissioner Skidmaker, would you go over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| Can I hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9720)|
| 2:42:01| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| In other words, this was proposed last year, and it's the single article cap sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| And what the deal is, if you go out and buy a $10,000 boat, okay, you have to pay sales tax on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9727)|
| 2:42:16| But the way it stands right now, the first $1,600, the state collects their 7%, and Knox County collects their 2.25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9736)|
| 2:42:27| only on the first $1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| The next $1,600, the state collects their 7%, and instead of giving us our 2.25%, they keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9750)|
| 2:42:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| Now, so it's not a tax increase to the consumer because they're paying the same tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9763)|
| 2:42:48| It's just a reallocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| That second set of $1,600, that tax should come back to the county where it's been purchased from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9770)|
| 2:42:58| If you think of every boat, car, motorcycle, motorhome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| that could be conceivably a lot of money to kind of make up for some of the haul income tax that's been missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9783)|
| 2:43:10| But again, it's got to get everybody across the state to say, hey, guys, come on, be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9790)|
| 2:43:16| Just July, August, and September, the state of Tennessee, just in total state collections of tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9796)|
| 2:43:28| they're up over last year $734 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9808)|
| 2:43:34| So they could kind of give us a little bit of our money back, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| It's not like they're hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| One of the things that I wanted to talk about as well that I've never really spoken of is business tax or personal property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9822)|
| 2:43:50| tangible property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| If we don't collect that, there's nothing that Knox County does like other counties do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| I mean, we can place a judgment lien on them or maybe try to seize their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9836)|
| 2:44:01| We don't have anywhere to put the things that they physically make money with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| But, you know, maybe we could see if we could have a little bit more teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| because right now there's about $4 million in delinquencies within the personal property area in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9849)|
| 2:44:16| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| Yeah, I had a question for Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9858)|
| 2:44:26| So on the first $1,600, the tax is 9.25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9866)|
| 2:44:33| So the state getting their 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| They get their 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| The state will always say it's their 7, it's their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| We get 9.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9881)|
| 2:44:42| And the next $1,600?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9882)|
| 2:44:45| They get 9.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| Okay, got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| Which is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| John, can you send that out to everybody as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| I know you have a pretty good printout of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| Mr. Chairman, if I'm not mistaken, that was taken away when the state was behind in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9896)|
| 2:45:04| And the state looked at it and said, hey, we'll take it from the county and we'll give it back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9904)|
| 2:45:11| That never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Was that when they were trying to shore up their pensions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| I know they took it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| They promised to give it back, but they never did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| So what happens with the third $1,600?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| Oh, just the balance of that then goes to 7% and the counties get nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| So if you bought a, in other words, anything above $3,200 is just 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| 7%, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| What's the cap on that too, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| It's $3,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| $3,200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9944)|
| 2:45:45| Yes, that's the cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| I have some just comments about the efficiency that our legislative and executive branch needs to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9948)|
| 2:46:01| Maybe it is, and I just am not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9961)|
| 2:46:04| But it would seem to behoove us that since we do have a professional lobbying firm down there that are representing our interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9964)|
| 2:46:16| that we should be holding hands with the mayor's office and coming together on two or three or four priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9976)|
| 2:46:26| and giving those as a collective to our lobbying group as well as to our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9986)|
| 2:46:35| so that they don't feel like they're, you know, having to answer they, the lobbyists and our state people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=9995)|
| 2:46:45| answer to so many different governing bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| I mean, that I would think would be a much more productive use of those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10008)|
| 2:46:54| I agree, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| Perhaps, Commissioner Schoenberger, one thing that we did last year was I believe you started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10015)|
| 2:47:00| or you or Chairman Hystrom started a forum post where people could post the legislative priorities that they are interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10020)|
| 2:47:08| and then you could collectively gather that and maybe we could work on that together with our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| Is that something you could do again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| And we'll discuss it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| Discuss it at the legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| And I was going to ask you, Mr. Chairman, if you could sit down with the mayor and Director Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10041)|
| 2:47:28| and see what their priorities are so that you can bring them back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| I think we need to put this again on the discussion item next week and you can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| You guys will have, when are you meeting in the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| Because of the public notice, I was thinking next Wednesday at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| I could bring back at least, if we could carry it over to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10065)|
| 2:47:48| I could bring back what the mayor's priorities are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| I think Commissioner Hill is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| We all need to be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10077)|
| 2:47:58| If you'll make a note of that to bring that up next week, Driscilla and the clerk, we'll hear this again, same discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10078)|
| 2:48:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10084)|
| 2:48:05| Seeing no more lights, that will conclude the business of the business of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10085)|
| 2:48:10| I'm going to take a short break and then we will return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| And as outlined in the beginning of our meeting, we'll have an hour more of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10094)|
| 2:48:21| Yes, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| If I may, I had mentioned earlier perhaps about opening up the discussion on this board about the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10102)|
| 2:48:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| Let's do that then before we take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| You have the floor, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| I would prefer to hear from the public the rest of their forum before we go into discussion on the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10121)|
| 2:48:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| So we will take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10129)|
| 2:48:50| We will return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| We will have one hour of public forum and then we will add the discussion item about the Board of Health that Miss Commissioner Hill would like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10131)|
| 2:48:58| So we will actually we will come back here at I'm going to do a 15-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10138)|
| 2:49:03| We will come back here at 820.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10143)|
| 2:49:08| In recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| I'm going to bring this meeting back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| As outlined prior to our break, we're going to do one hour of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10155)|
| 2:49:22| Then we're going to go to a discussion item from Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10162)|

| 2:50:51| Hi, my name is Sarah Thomas, and my address is 6206 Babley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10251)|
| 2:51:01| I have been married for almost 20 years, and I have four children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10261)|
| 2:51:06| Their ages are almost 17, 15, 7, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10266)|
| 2:51:13| The three oldest are homeschooled through Berean Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| I'm a believer and follower of Jesus Christ, and I strive to live my life for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10278)|
| 2:51:24| My dear sweet husband over there always reminds me when I get caught up in things that do I want to be remembered for being the crazy lady on YouTube or for loving Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10284)|
| 2:51:41| And so I just want to say that I'm here to talk tonight to you all because I love my country, and I love this state, and I love this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10301)|

| 2:52:04| When Commissioner Larson Jay was asked why he chose to ignore the Knox County Board of Health mask mandate during a meeting, which has become known as Tablegate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10324)|
| 2:52:15| he stated on social media, I am responsible for my own actions and no one else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10335)|
| 2:52:23| I want to firmly stand with Commissioner Jay on this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10343)|
| 2:52:29| I am responsible for my own actions and no one else, certainly not the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10349)|
| 2:52:37| Unfortunately, the Board of Health has decided that I'm not responsible enough to determine my own actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10357)|
| 2:52:45| I didn't elect them to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10365)|
| 2:52:49| I actually didn't elect them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| In fact, no one did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10372)|
| 2:52:55| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| Our country was founded on the idea that our government would be based on elected representation with checks and balances between the different branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10377)|
| 2:53:07| As a citizen, when I look at the Knox County Board of Health, I see a group that I have no recourse against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10387)|
| 2:53:15| There is no inherent check or balance against their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10395)|
| 2:53:21| As stated at the last Commissioner's meeting by the Law Director, there is also no limit to what they can mandate as long as it is in the interest of public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10401)|
| 2:53:34| including but certainly not limited to attempting to infringe on the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10414)|
| 2:53:43| They cannot be voted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10423)|
| 2:53:45| They cannot be recalled by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| I cannot stop them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| Which is why I'm asking you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10430)|
| 2:53:53| I'm asking you to abolish the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10433)|
| 2:53:58| When asked on October 14th how long it would be until the Board of Health lifted the mask mandate, Dr. Buchanan stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10438)|
| 2:54:07| it would be as long as we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10447)|
| 2:54:12| That is not how our government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| It's not about the will of an unelected board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10455)|
| 2:54:19| It's about the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| I want to leave you with one more quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| It's from the Declaration of Independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10464)|

| 2:54:36| that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10488)|
| 2:54:54| it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10494)|
| 2:54:58| It's time to abolish the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10498)|

| 2:55:22| My name is Gary Scherina, 11912 Butternut Lane, Farragut, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10522)|
| 2:55:30| Thank you for allowing me to speak, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| On August 5th, our 28-year-old son Gregory was working at FedEx out on Bertle Camp Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10534)|
| 2:55:41| died of heat stroke, wearing the damn mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| And I hold you and the Board of Health personally responsible for his death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| He was a healthy 28-year-old, and he did have lung issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10550)|
| 2:55:57| He had asthma as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| In none of this mandate are people required to be tested for pulmonary function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10559)|
| 2:56:05| And had he been tested for pulmonary function, I would believe he would not be suitable for a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10565)|
| 2:56:11| That's the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10571)|
| 2:56:12| I worked for Kimberly Clark for 36 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| I retired from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| We gave pulmonary function tests to people before they wore a dust mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10577)|
| 2:56:22| But to me, it's criminal to dictate, and I see people, old people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| I've got COPD and emphysema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10586)|

| 2:56:30| I don't wear the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| I see old people worse than me wearing a mask, struggling, sitting down, getting tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| There's no requirement in this law that was just made up out of whole cloth for pulmonary function testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10597)|
| 2:56:45| There's no specifications on masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| And the whole mask thing, I'm not going to get into the politics of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10608)|
| 2:56:52| because there's more politics there than science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| But there's no – I mean, since 1918, we've not been wearing masks with the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10615)|
| 2:57:01| The flu and the COVID are the same size particle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| Okay, finally, the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| I go to church every day at St. John Newman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| Three days a week, the little children that are wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| Their brains are developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| Their brains need oxygen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| We're – I think we're guilty of raising a stupid generation right now, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| But this next batch, as long as we keep them covered up, hide their faces, all the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10641)|
| 2:57:28| I mean, it's child abuse, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10648)|
| 2:57:31| So anyhow, I'm going to give up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| I mean, I'm a man of few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| But I do hold you responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| And I'll tell you what, now I know that you guys can stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10658)|
| 2:57:42| And I'll hold you responsible if you don't do something about this, because this is un-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10662)|
| 2:57:47| It's wrong, and it's unscientific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10667)|

| 2:59:05| I thank God for 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| But I also pray that somehow Greg's death could do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| Something to help other kids not have to be going through the same stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| I mean, you can imagine, when you're breathing heavy and working hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10758)|
| 2:59:25| your muscles are cramping because there's not enough oxygen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| That's why you breathe heavier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| And to limit the amount going in, he had to be cramping all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10770)|
| 2:59:35| But he kept on pushing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| If this is your son, if it's your daughter doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10777)|

| 2:59:48| Just think of those parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| Nobody wants to let their kids go through what we've gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10790)|

| 3:00:26| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10826)|
| 3:00:29| As a mom, there are a lot of things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| And one of the things I've always done with my kids is when they come and talk to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10832)|
| 3:00:36| I say, okay, do you want me to listen, do you want me to offer advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| or do you want me to intervene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| The reason you've seen me twice is because my 18-year-old and 15-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10845)|
| 3:00:50| have asked me to intervene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10850)|
| 3:00:53| They're the ones who go along, they do what they're told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| They are not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| But they ask me to intervene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| So when I read this to you, I want you to know that this is on behalf of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| that I'm doing what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10864)|
| 3:01:07| So here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| I truly hope that things would have changed by this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| That is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| The Board of Health is still mandating and restricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| I don't know about you, but I don't see anything that is happening that's improving anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10876)|
| 3:01:22| In fact, the mental health issues and every other health issue are being swept under the rug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10882)|
| 3:01:28| Isn't the Board of Health responsible for all health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| The governor lifted restrictions on the other 89 counties weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| and asked our Board of Health to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| Not only did they leave the restrictions, they moved their meetings to every other week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10900)|
| 3:01:44| pushing back a public forum to fall break week of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| What is the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| Not only did we learn that the Board existed, but they have unchecked power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10910)|
| 3:01:54| and can impose anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10914)|
| 3:01:56| And the quote that's been shared before was Dr. Buchanan from last week when somebody asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10916)|
| 3:02:01| how long do we make things last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10921)|

| 3:02:06| From the WHO, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10926)|

| 3:02:15| and there are potential harms to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| Dr. Fauci co-authored a study in 2008 studying the Spanish flu of 1918,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10939)|

| 3:02:56| Since the mask mandate on July 3rd and restrictions on businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10976)|
| 3:03:00| we've not seen less cases, we've seen more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| Maybe masks and restrictions are the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| Why isn't the Board of Health talking about building our immune system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| and taking better care of ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=10990)|

| 3:03:55| and say the cost is too high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| Those that are making decisions are listening to medical bureaucrats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| not those in the field who are seeing patients daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| Unfortunately, many of those medical professionals fear for their jobs if they speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11043)|

| 3:05:37| I'll give you words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11137)|
| 3:05:38| That vision was with the prophet Nathan standing before the King David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11138)|
| 3:05:44| I was then confirmed of that because my pastor preached a sermon that touched on that subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11144)|

| 3:07:39| He told me to be bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11259)|

| 3:08:54| And I pray every day that I don't trigger anyone who sees my maskless, smiling face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11334)|

| 3:09:24| My name is Jessica Breidenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11364)|
| 3:09:26| I don't feel comfortable stating my address, but I do live in the 37920 district, Carson Daly's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11366)|

| 3:09:39| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| I just wanted to say thank you for kind of sitting here with all of us tonight and for the past three or four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11381)|
| 3:09:46| and just listening to what we have to say, reading my emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| I've gotten responses from some of you, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| So as I stand here, I just really have one thing to say, and that is please dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11391)|
| 3:09:59| You've heard some very compelling arguments and some very compelling speeches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| and just the way that people have come up here tonight pretty much bare their souls to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11403)|
| 3:10:09| I just really implore you to please dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| This is a necessary action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| Anybody that does not see that, I just don't see how you could disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11415)|
| 3:10:21| The very fact that we have county commissioners and we have all of you to represent us is part of the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11421)|
| 3:10:31| Really, the reason that you are here is because we have a Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11431)|
| 3:10:36| and the fact that we have a board that is not accountable, they are not able to answer to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11436)|
| 3:10:46| They could mandate really anything at this point, which is terrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11446)|
| 3:10:51| The fact that this is a fact and that we are still not seeing any progress being made in the direction of dissolution is very dangerous and very scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11451)|
| 3:11:04| So as I stand here before you tonight as a citizen of the county and as a citizen of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| I will say to you again, please dissolve Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| Rebecca Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| Also, as you make your way down, is Jonathan Tu here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11480)|
| 3:11:25| Tiana Tu sent me a message saying she was not going to be able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11485)|
| 3:11:30| Is Debbie Stafford here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| Is Glenn Stafford here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| Richard Cunningham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| And Jada King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| Is Jada King here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| If you would please state your name and address for the record. You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| Yes, my name is Rebecca Reeves and I live in the Pine Springs neighborhood in Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| So I was at the last meeting until almost midnight. I didn't make it as long as everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11513)|
| 3:11:58| But I read an article a few days later that stated that people like me were here to declare that COVID was a hoax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11518)|
| 3:12:05| But not one person in the building said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| We know that this virus is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11528)|
| 3:12:10| We are seeing a spike in COVID cases and a rise in other health conditions like pneumonia from chronic mask use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11530)|
| 3:12:17| And because untrained population is donning PPE and cross-contaminating their own mask at a high rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11537)|
| 3:12:23| So that leads me to believe that we are either being ignored, lied about, or lied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| And I think a good mix of all three is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| So obviously, what we have to say is following on mostly deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| And there are a few here who are trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| And to those of you, I say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11557)|
| 3:12:38| But here we find ourselves with a survivable virus for 99% of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11558)|
| 3:12:44| This is no longer a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| An increase in cases that don't lead to more deaths, that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11566)|
| 3:12:50| Yet there are very good people out here who are scared to death because of a rise in cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11570)|
| 3:12:55| This narrative is being pushed in their face every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11575)|
| 3:12:58| But the deaths continue to remain low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11578)|
| 3:13:00| So those of us who have been loyal, law-abiding citizens have stood in the shadows waiting for our leaders to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11580)|
| 3:13:06| But seven months later, we are seeing that it's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| So I'm not going to stand here and waste my time telling the truth about masks, lockdowns, and the unconstitutionality of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11589)|
| 3:13:17| They already know it's all been presented, verified, and ignored because of politics, peer pressure, and agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11597)|
| 3:13:24| So tonight, I'll spend the rest of my time not talking to the committee, but talking to the real people with power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11604)|
| 3:13:29| And that is the citizens of Knox County in this audience and those who are watching at home now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11609)|
| 3:13:33| So I say to you, my fellow citizens, the Board of Health has as much power as we give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11613)|
| 3:13:39| I don't give them any power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| I don't wear a mask when I go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| And I urge you to not give them any power either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11625)|
| 3:13:48| As they said, what was it last week, that this ends when they say it ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11628)|
| 3:13:53| I say, no, it ends now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| And it can end now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| But I can't do this by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| And I need you to stand up with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| If you're walking into a store and you're wearing a mask or you're obeying any of these mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| because you want to be delicate or you don't want to ruffle any feathers, then you're part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11644)|
| 3:14:10| And I was a part of the problem until I saw what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| A mandate is not a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| And if more of us stood up, this would end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| I want to show you, this is my five-year-old's mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11658)|
| 3:14:22| It's disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11662)|
| 3:14:24| I pulled this off her face when she got off the bus today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| If you can see it, it is horribly disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| And she breathes that in all day long, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| She doesn't do her extracurriculars anymore, no more gymnastics, no more dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| because she's begging me for free breath of air when she gets home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| I said, you can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| But she said, please, Mom, no more masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| And it breaks my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11682)|
| 3:14:44| So they've regressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| All of my children have regressed in all of their activities because they refuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| I've given them the choice, which is more than most people have given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| But I've given them the choice if they want to continue wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| And my children have looked me in the face and said, no, Mama, we want to breathe when we come home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11692)|
| 3:14:56| It is ridiculous that people who wear these masks outside of sanitized medical facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11696)|
| 3:15:01| which have optimal air control, look utterly ridiculous with these used, germ-filled tissue diapers on their faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11701)|

| 3:15:18| Everyone wants to be liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11718)|

| 3:17:24| I'm not really sure where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| I've been such a bundle of thoughts and feelings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11846)|
| 3:17:30| I think I'm going to start with stating that my clinic over the last two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| has exploded with COVID-like cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| We generally discourage possible COVID cases from coming inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| so we do a lot of phone consultations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11861)|
| 3:17:43| Unfortunately, I had to send one of my patients to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11863)|
| 3:17:46| The one commonality I heard from almost all those patients is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11866)|
| 3:17:51| but I've worn a mask and done everything the Board of Health said to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11871)|
| 3:17:55| I think that speaks volumes about how what we're being told to do is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11875)|
| 3:18:01| The CDC last week released a study showing that 85% of the people with COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| that they studied either stated they wore a mask all the time or almost all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11886)|
| 3:18:12| Last week, the University of Vermont released a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| which cited that specifically wearing a mask outside of work is associated with contracting COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11894)|
| 3:18:26| I've said several times up here, we do not know how to wear a mask properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11906)|
| 3:18:31| You put on a mask, you don't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| Everyone touches their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| Cloth masks have not undergone the rigors of double-blind, peer-reviewed studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| We're doing things that are not scientific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| We're doing things for feelings, not because it's scientific or because it's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11922)|
| 3:18:47| The other issue patients have also told me when they've had COVID-like illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11927)|
| 3:18:52| and I've advised them to go get a COVID test and to self-quarantine until they're symptom-free at least 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11932)|
| 3:18:58| It's okay, I'll wear a mask when I'm out in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11938)|
| 3:19:01| Or, I can't afford to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| Just last week, my husband and I went to the Expo Center to early vote Wednesday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11944)|
| 3:19:09| and he had a poll worker tell him, oh honey, don't get near me, I'm sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11949)|
| 3:19:14| Why on earth do we have poll workers who are sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11954)|
| 3:19:17| Because she had on a mask and that made it okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11957)|
| 3:19:20| I tried to call the Election Commission to report it, but it was after 4.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11960)|
| 3:19:25| The Board of Health has made it clear they don't want to hear from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| They have said email is good enough, but we get no response when we email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11968)|
| 3:19:32| It's offensive that we take the time to reach out to them and you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11972)|
| 3:19:36| and we don't even get so much as a thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| I know you all are busy, I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| The Board of Health seems completely out of touch with patient autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11981)|
| 3:19:45| We had one member of the Board of Health state during a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| that public health doesn't consider individual needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| We have two thoughts that are colliding in healthcare right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| One is an Orwellian thought, the greater good, that's all that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=11996)|
| 3:20:00| The other thought that I was trained to fight for the final straw in nursing is patient autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12000)|
| 3:20:08| The patient decides what happens in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| We are to be their partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| It's not to be big me, little you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12014)|
| 3:20:16| It's to be me sharing what I know about healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12016)|
| 3:20:19| and trying to help you make the best decision for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12019)|
| 3:20:22| And if you choose the decision I disagree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12022)|
| 3:20:24| that's your right as a human being and an American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12024)|

| 3:26:44| move the mask, take it on and off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12404)|
| 3:26:46| while touching your face repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| You also put the mask on a dirty surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| then put it right back on your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| There is repeated evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| of the failure of mask mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| in diverse places such as Los Angeles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12417)|

| 3:27:05| The only randomized, controlled study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| of community masking is from Denmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| is not being published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| as no journal is brave enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12431)|
| 3:27:12| since the apparent conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12432)|
| 3:27:14| does not fit the current mask narrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12434)|
| 3:27:16| Lastly, the mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12436)|
| 3:27:18| has pitted citizens against each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| and further divisiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| yet the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12442)|
| 3:27:24| continues to double down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| The Board of Health also forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| bar and restaurant closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12448)|

| 3:27:32| which used to be 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| There is no data to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| We nor others like Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| have seen any evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| that bars or restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| have access to this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12462)|
| 3:27:44| So why does this Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12464)|
| 3:27:46| continue to punish them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| This must stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| The survival rate of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12470)|

| 3:27:54| yet the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| continues to focus on UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12476)|
| 3:27:58| and Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12478)|
| 3:28:00| They should quit testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12480)|
| 3:28:02| the sewage at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12482)|

| 3:28:10| Their focus again is misdirected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| It is up to the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12492)|
| 3:28:14| to learn what PCR testing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| what it means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| and what cycle amplification means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12498)|
| 3:28:20| Every metric they use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12500)|
| 3:28:22| is based off numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12502)|
| 3:28:24| from this kind of testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12504)|
| 3:28:26| The fact is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| none of their numbers are reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| None of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| The tests do not detect actual virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12512)|
| 3:28:34| they do not mean the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| is infectious or contagious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| and most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12518)|
| 3:28:40| do not mean that person is a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12520)|
| 3:28:42| of infectious or contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| The Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12524)|
| 3:28:46| has stated some truths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12526)|
| 3:28:48| including that PCR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12528)|
| 3:28:50| was a gold-standard test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12530)|
| 3:28:52| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| the American College of Pathology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12534)|
| 3:28:56| and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12536)|
| 3:28:58| including the American College of Virology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12538)|
| 3:29:00| accurately state there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| no gold-standard test for COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| She also stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| the cycle amplification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12546)|
| 3:29:08| is set by the manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12548)|
| 3:29:10| Wrong again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| I asked the entire Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| last week to contact a local lab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| to understand the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12558)|
| 3:29:20| As of this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12560)|
| 3:29:22| none had done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| It is a sad state of affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| when neither the Health Department Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| nor the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| understand how the testing is conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| and what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| It is clear to me that the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12574)|
| 3:29:36| must return to their advisory-only status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| If the only option to accomplish this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| is to dissolve the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12580)|
| 3:29:42| the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| will not accept any mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12584)|
| 3:29:46| from an unaccountable Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12586)|
| 3:29:48| Thomas Sowell stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| it is hard to imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| a more stupid or more dangerous way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12592)|
| 3:29:54| of making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12594)|
| 3:29:56| than by putting those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12596)|
| 3:29:58| in the hands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12598)|
| 3:30:00| who pay no price for being wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12600)|

| 3:30:14| You guys have heard everything, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| You've been reading our emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12616)|

| 3:30:20| So, I just implore you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12620)|
| 3:30:22| this is the only line of defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12622)|
| 3:30:25| we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12625)|
| 3:30:27| Until we get it addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12627)|
| 3:30:29| at a state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12629)|
| 3:30:31| this is the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| that we can stop an unelected Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| from having the power that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| To do like Biggs and Ward suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12639)|
| 3:30:40| Pretty much anything they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| in the name of public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| So, I just ask you to take this step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=12648)|

| 3:42:05| then my vote should count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| just as much as theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13327)|

| 3:45:27| This is so much more than masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| This is not about masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13529)|
| 3:45:32| and I agree with everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13532)|
| 3:45:34| that has given data about the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| For the most part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13536)|
| 3:45:38| I may not agree with every point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13538)|
| 3:45:40| but for the most part it was right on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13540)|
| 3:45:42| and I think if you look further into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13542)|
| 3:45:44| you'll find that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13544)|
| 3:45:46| but it's not about the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| It's about the fact that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13548)|
| 3:45:49| unelected officials mandating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| whether we face fines or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| whether we face prison time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13553)|
| 3:45:55| jail time or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| that's not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| The problem is that they have powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| and they're not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| They have legislative powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| and they're not elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| and you know that's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| We know that's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| So whether I agree with masks or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| whether I agree with the mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| that they are giving or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13575)|
| 3:46:17| that doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13577)|
| 3:46:19| It has been brought up again and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| in this place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13581)|
| 3:46:24| for the last month or two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13584)|
| 3:46:27| especially the last three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| that they have legislative powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13589)|
| 3:46:33| They're not supposed to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| I have a pocket constitution that I carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13595)|
| 3:46:39| and I carry it most of the places that I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13599)|
| 3:46:42| because it matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13602)|
| 3:46:44| and I know that most of you believe that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13604)|
| 3:46:46| I would say the majority of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13606)|
| 3:46:47| would claim to be patriots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| I would hope all of you would claim to be patriots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13609)|
| 3:46:52| and love our constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13612)|
| 3:46:54| That is not okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13614)|
| 3:46:56| for unelected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13616)|
| 3:46:58| to have legislative powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13618)|
| 3:47:00| You didn't give them those legislative powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13620)|
| 3:47:02| Our state did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| and that needs to be fought on a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13624)|
| 3:47:07| So what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| Do we sit back and just hope that it goes away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13629)|
| 3:47:11| Do we sit back and wait for the state to deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13631)|
| 3:47:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13633)|
| 3:47:15| We dissolve the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13635)|
| 3:47:17| and that's what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| That's what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| You can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| You may not be able...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| I mean, two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| you guys had...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| you passed the resolution I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| or I'm not sure of the terminology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13651)|
| 3:47:33| but you passed something that stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| that they could no longer make mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| that were above what our state makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| but it did nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| and you knew it would do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| That's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13663)|
| 3:47:45| We appreciate the time you put into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| and then tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| you consider something that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13669)|
| 3:47:51| okay, they need to have public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13671)|
| 3:47:53| like you have public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| and we appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13675)|
| 3:47:57| but it does nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| There's no teeth behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13679)|
| 3:48:01| because if they are not elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| then they don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13683)|
| 3:48:05| okay, so they have to listen to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13685)|
| 3:48:07| and we might come for three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| There might be three hours of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| That doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13691)|
| 3:48:13| because they're not elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13693)|
| 3:48:15| so there is nothing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13695)|
| 3:48:17| no one that they're accountable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| and that's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| So two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| I believe that you said something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| to the effect of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| what are we supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| Just dissolve the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| and be unlike any other state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| Nobody's ever done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13717)|
| 3:48:39| Are we supposed to be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13719)|
| 3:48:41| I say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| Why are we afraid to be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13723)|
| 3:48:45| Why are we afraid to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13725)|
| 3:48:47| even if it wasn't for the pilgrims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| saying I'm going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13729)|
| 3:48:51| that's never been done before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| They were willing to give their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13733)|
| 3:48:55| their families, their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13735)|
| 3:48:57| everything to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| that had never been done before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| and then fast forward to the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| fast forward to the Declaration of Independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| fast forward to all of these moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| in our history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13747)|
| 3:49:09| where somebody was willing to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| I'm not afraid of what people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| I'm going to do what it takes to do what's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| no matter what it costs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| I can stand here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| It might seem like no big deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| because it's just a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| Eventually this will be over, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| I mean, the pandemic will be over eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13765)|
| 3:49:28| and we will go back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13768)|
| 3:49:30| But see, the problem still is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13770)|
| 3:49:33| Even if this goes away tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| the problem is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| The fact that we have unelected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| that have legislative power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13780)|
| 3:49:42| So that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13782)|
| 3:49:44| even if there's emotional appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13784)|
| 3:49:47| for what it takes and what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13787)|
| 3:49:49| And I so appreciate the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13789)|
| 3:49:51| who have shared those emotional appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13791)|
| 3:49:53| They matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13793)|
| 3:49:55| But it's time to go beyond emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| and actually look at what's right and wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| and be willing to stand up and do what it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13799)|
| 3:50:01| even if nobody else is willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13803)|

| 3:50:07| That concludes the public forum portion of our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13807)|
| 3:50:11| And the last item before we adjourn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13811)|
| 3:50:14| is Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13814)|
| 3:50:16| I'd like to have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13816)|
| 3:50:18| on the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13818)|
| 3:50:20| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13820)|
| 3:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13822)|
| 3:50:28| You guys are very eloquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13828)|
| 3:50:30| Let me tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13830)|
| 3:50:32| it's heartbreaking to hear some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13832)|
| 3:50:33| that you have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13833)|
| 3:50:39| I really respect several things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13839)|
| 3:50:41| that were said here tonight by our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13841)|
| 3:50:44| Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13844)|
| 3:50:46| I respect your statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13846)|
| 3:50:49| about we need to just get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13849)|
| 3:50:54| Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13854)|
| 3:50:56| I really heard you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13856)|
| 3:50:58| when you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13858)|
| 3:51:00| some of the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13860)|
| 3:51:01| tonight really kind of led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13861)|
| 3:51:03| by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| to make some provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| in case other things don't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13867)|
| 3:51:09| or don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| I agree with all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| I also believe, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| that as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13877)|
| 3:51:20| this commission has continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13880)|
| 3:51:22| to step around this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13882)|
| 3:51:24| about the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13884)|
| 3:51:26| and what we will or won't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13886)|
| 3:51:29| I've had direct conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13889)|
| 3:51:31| with more than one of you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13891)|
| 3:51:35| I don't care to tell any of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13895)|
| 3:51:38| and I think you've indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13898)|
| 3:51:40| others of us have said to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13900)|
| 3:51:42| we don't like it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13902)|
| 3:51:44| I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13904)|
| 3:51:46| I don't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13906)|
| 3:51:48| I do not like the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13908)|
| 3:51:50| that we have an unelected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13910)|
| 3:51:52| that's making these decisions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| I don't like it one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13915)|
| 3:51:57| And at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13917)|
| 3:52:00| I am very hopeful that it will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13920)|
| 3:52:03| and I hope that it changes sooner or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13923)|
| 3:52:06| Sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13926)|
| 3:52:10| I want you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13930)|
| 3:52:12| that I'm listening to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| that I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| I want you to know, too, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13936)|
| 3:52:19| that just like everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13939)|
| 3:52:21| on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| I represent a constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| And you collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| are probably one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| most passionate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13949)|
| 3:52:35| sincere representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13955)|
| 3:52:41| of a larger constituency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13961)|
| 3:52:45| that I've heard in a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13965)|
| 3:52:48| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13968)|
| 3:52:50| And as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| I probably agree with about 90 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| of everything that you all said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| I appreciate that more than you can know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13976)|
| 3:52:58| I also have gotten floods of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13978)|
| 3:53:02| from the great divide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13982)|
| 3:53:06| from the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13986)|
| 3:53:08| from people that are just like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13988)|
| 3:53:10| They are good people just like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13990)|
| 3:53:12| that, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13992)|
| 3:53:15| many of them have been quite distressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13995)|
| 3:53:18| through all of this, quite frightened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=13998)|
| 3:53:20| and believe the opposite of what you believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14000)|
| 3:53:24| And you all know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14004)|
| 3:53:27| I mean, this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| almost like our presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14009)|
| 3:53:32| It's divided people down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14012)|
| 3:53:34| There are both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14014)|
| 3:53:36| and they both are well-versed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14016)|
| 3:53:38| and well-educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14018)|
| 3:53:40| I have a significant population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14020)|
| 3:53:43| of elderly that live in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14023)|
| 3:53:47| And I will tell you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14027)|
| 3:53:50| those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14030)|
| 3:53:52| they're afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14032)|
| 3:53:54| They are afraid of this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14034)|
| 3:53:57| But they believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| like it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| they believe the things that our Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14041)|
| 3:54:04| and that many, many doctors have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14044)|
| 3:54:06| even though we have other doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14046)|
| 3:54:09| that say the exact opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| And I had a conversation, Christine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14051)|
| 3:54:15| with you earlier today about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| well, okay, we need to educate these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14057)|
| 3:54:21| And, you know, I believe you said that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| And my comment back was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| then they just go and pick up a magazine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14065)|
| 3:54:29| from AARP or someplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14069)|
| 3:54:33| and read exactly opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14073)|
| 3:54:36| of what I may have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| or you may have said to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| So I say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| that as easy as it might sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| to try to introduce people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| to other methodologies of science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14086)|
| 3:54:51| that disagree with what the presentation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14091)|
| 3:54:55| there are a group of people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14095)|
| 3:54:58| that it's very difficult to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14098)|
| 3:55:00| to do that with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14100)|
| 3:55:02| So I say all that to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14102)|
| 3:55:10| I do not believe that this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14110)|
| 3:55:15| and I speak for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14115)|
| 3:55:17| is the point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14117)|
| 3:55:20| to try to make this kind of a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14120)|
| 3:55:23| because we are in a very stressful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14123)|
| 3:55:28| volatile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14128)|
| 3:55:31| divided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14131)|
| 3:55:35| county at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14135)|
| 3:55:38| And I think it is unwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14138)|
| 3:55:42| to make this type of a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14142)|
| 3:55:46| when people are highly stressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14146)|
| 3:55:50| highly divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14150)|
| 3:55:52| And these are good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14152)|
| 3:55:54| I mean, even our own medical community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14154)|
| 3:55:57| is on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14157)|
| 3:56:01| And I am a little bit fearful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14161)|
| 3:56:05| to make that type of a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14165)|
| 3:56:08| when we are in the hype of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14168)|
| 3:56:11| Now, I don't believe we're going to be here forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14171)|
| 3:56:16| I'm as distressed as anybody that this has lasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14176)|
| 3:56:20| You know, the months that it's lasted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14180)|
| 3:56:22| nobody ever dreamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| that we would be still dealing with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14184)|
| 3:56:27| nine, ten months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14187)|
| 3:56:29| however long it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14189)|
| 3:56:31| I mean, I'm sick of it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| We're all sick of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| We're all just tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| and we want life to get back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| I do believe that we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14199)|
| 3:56:42| hopefully sooner than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14202)|
| 3:56:44| have our life back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14204)|
| 3:56:46| And when this settles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14206)|
| 3:56:49| when we truly are on the downhill side of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14209)|
| 3:56:53| I commit to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14213)|
| 3:56:55| I promise you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| that if it hasn't happened by that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14217)|
| 3:57:00| I will lead the charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14220)|
| 3:57:03| to make sure that our Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14223)|
| 3:57:07| no longer has this kind of power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14227)|
| 3:57:11| in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14231)|
| 3:57:13| So, for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14233)|
| 3:57:16| even though I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14236)|
| 3:57:18| I am not prepared at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14238)|
| 3:57:20| to introduce an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14240)|
| 3:57:24| to try to dissolve our Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14244)|
| 3:57:27| or make our health strictly an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14247)|
| 3:57:30| I'm not saying never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14250)|
| 3:57:32| and I'm not saying if someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14252)|
| 3:57:34| doesn't step up and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14254)|
| 3:57:36| that I may still, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14256)|
| 3:57:38| change my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14258)|
| 3:57:40| But you all have sat out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14260)|
| 3:57:41| and been honest with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14261)|
| 3:57:44| and I have strived very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14264)|
| 3:57:46| to be perfectly honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14266)|
| 3:57:49| And I know that what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14269)|
| 3:57:51| is not what you all will want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14271)|
| 3:57:53| at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14273)|
| 3:57:55| but it is where I am at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14275)|
| 3:57:58| and I feel like where I stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14278)|
| 3:58:00| is the best representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14280)|
| 3:58:02| of the people that I represent in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14282)|
| 3:58:06| So, I really hope that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14286)|
| 3:58:09| that I have said my piece on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14289)|
| 3:58:11| that some of the rest of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14291)|
| 3:58:13| will also give these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14293)|
| 3:58:15| the consideration of letting them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| where you are and how you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14297)|
| 3:58:20| about this quandrum that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14300)|
| 3:58:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14304)|
| 3:58:26| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14306)|
| 3:58:28| May I have one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14308)|
| 3:58:30| Ma'am, not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14310)|
| 3:58:32| Just to let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14312)|
| 3:58:34| that we hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14314)|
| 3:58:36| My husband said something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14316)|
| 3:58:38| We are calling you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14318)|
| 3:58:39| on behalf of our son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14319)|
| 3:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14321)|
| 3:58:43| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14323)|
| 3:58:45| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14325)|
| 3:58:52| Last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14332)|
| 3:58:54| Commissioner Worden and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14334)|
| 3:58:56| brought forth a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14336)|
| 3:58:58| to hopefully direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| the way that we wanted to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| the Board of Health go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14342)|
| 3:59:04| and I feel like they didn't listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14344)|
| 3:59:07| I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14347)|
| 3:59:09| there was a lot of good cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14349)|
| 3:59:11| made tonight here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14351)|
| 3:59:13| by our public speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14353)|
| 3:59:15| and I appreciate your views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14355)|
| 3:59:17| Commissioner Hill as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14357)|
| 3:59:20| Whenever I got elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14360)|
| 3:59:22| I wanted to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14362)|
| 3:59:24| I grew up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14364)|
| 3:59:26| with a couple of guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14366)|
| 3:59:29| in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14369)|
| 3:59:30| and their mom is a woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14370)|
| 3:59:32| that I respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14372)|
| 3:59:34| Her name is Vivian Scheib,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14374)|
| 3:59:36| and she says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14376)|
| 3:59:38| that she's the voice of the voiceless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14378)|
| 3:59:40| and I believe her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14380)|
| 3:59:42| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14382)|
| 3:59:44| And I believe you guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14384)|
| 3:59:46| striving for what you feel like is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14386)|
| 3:59:48| I believe Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14388)|
| 3:59:50| does a lot of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| I believe that there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14392)|
| 3:59:54| from both sides of the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14394)|
| 3:59:56| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14396)|
| 3:59:57| I get thousands of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| Actually, you guys would believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| You guys are a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14401)|
| 4:00:02| Commissioner Ward brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| a lot of good points tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14404)|
| 4:00:06| and I respect each and every one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14406)|
| 4:00:08| of my county commissioners up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| but I think this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14410)|
| 4:00:14| needs to be continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14414)|
| 4:00:16| next Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14416)|
| 4:00:18| and I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14418)|
| 4:00:20| David Sanders here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14420)|
| 4:00:21| from the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| because we probably will have some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| if that's okay, Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14425)|
| 4:00:28| I'd like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14428)|
| 4:00:29| well, Dr. Buchanan will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| She's stuck it out this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| I'm sure she'll be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| next week as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14435)|
| 4:00:37| and I would like for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14437)|
| 4:00:39| to figure out who the chair is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14439)|
| 4:00:41| of that board that Commissioner J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14441)|
| 4:00:43| was speaking of earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| or Chairman J was speaking of earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| that can kind of advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14447)|
| 4:00:49| the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14449)|
| 4:00:51| and some of the things we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14451)|
| 4:00:53| Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14453)|
| 4:00:54| Community Health Council, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14454)|
| 4:00:56| Sorry, it's a late one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14456)|
| 4:00:57| And maybe we can contact them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| and have them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| because I'm ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| and I'm to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14463)|
| 4:01:05| to where we need to get everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14465)|
| 4:01:07| in this room next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| and let's make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| on what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14471)|
| 4:01:13| and let's stand firm on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14473)|
| 4:01:15| and that way both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14475)|
| 4:01:17| can be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14477)|
| 4:01:19| and we're either going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=14479)|

| 4:11:32| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15092)|
| 4:11:33| what you're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15093)|

| 4:11:36| for protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15096)|
| 4:11:37| I believe it's our duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15097)|
| 4:11:38| to see that you have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15098)|
| 4:11:41| I believe you elect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15101)|

| 4:11:47| we can make laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15107)|

| 4:11:55| I do think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15115)|
| 4:11:56| a health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15116)|

| 4:12:09| to mitigate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15129)|
| 4:12:10| as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15130)|

| 4:12:22| to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15142)|
| 4:12:24| that it can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15144)|
| 4:12:25| for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15145)|
| 4:12:27| So, there is a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15147)|
| 4:12:28| we have a health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15148)|
| 4:12:30| and it's not to mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15150)|
| 4:12:32| or to punish you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15152)|
| 4:12:33| for not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15153)|
| 4:12:34| something that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15154)|
| 4:12:35| should have just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15155)|
| 4:12:36| asked you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15156)|
| 4:12:40| When I'm around the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15160)|
| 4:12:42| I'm afraid my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15162)|
| 4:12:43| is also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| I'm going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15165)|
| 4:12:46| younger than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15166)|
| 4:12:48| so I'll get points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15168)|
| 4:12:49| when I go home tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15169)|
| 4:12:52| And I'm afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15172)|
| 4:12:53| of taking something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15173)|
| 4:12:54| back to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15174)|
| 4:12:55| I'm afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15175)|
| 4:12:56| of taking something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15176)|
| 4:12:57| to my 92-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15177)|
| 4:12:58| mother-in-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15178)|
| 4:13:02| But we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15182)|
| 4:13:03| work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15183)|
| 4:13:04| We've got to respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15184)|
| 4:13:05| one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15185)|
| 4:13:06| We're divided in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15186)|
| 4:13:08| As you heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15188)|
| 4:13:09| one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15189)|
| 4:13:10| it's either this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15190)|
| 4:13:11| or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15191)|
| 4:13:12| or there's no in-between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15192)|
| 4:13:14| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15194)|
| 4:13:15| in saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15195)|
| 4:13:18| I respect people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15198)|
| 4:13:19| that wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15199)|
| 4:13:21| I don't hate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15201)|
| 4:13:22| that don't wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15202)|
| 4:13:24| My thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15204)|
| 4:13:25| I want to keep away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15205)|
| 4:13:26| from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15206)|
| 4:13:27| as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15207)|
| 4:13:28| until this gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15208)|
| 4:13:30| starts decreasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15210)|
| 4:13:31| at rapid numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15211)|
| 4:13:34| And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15214)|
| 4:13:35| when we gather together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| we've got to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15217)|
| 4:13:38| that distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15220)|
| 4:13:41| I wish we could come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15221)|
| 4:13:42| to some sort of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15222)|
| 4:13:44| The people that want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15224)|
| 4:13:45| to wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15225)|
| 4:13:46| wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15226)|
| 4:13:47| The people that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15227)|
| 4:13:48| want to wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15228)|
| 4:13:49| that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| But we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15231)|
| 4:13:52| keep apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15232)|
| 4:13:53| if people wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| Now, I know the mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15235)|
| 4:13:56| doesn't protect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15236)|
| 4:13:58| It just protects you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15238)|
| 4:13:59| from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15239)|
| 4:14:02| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15242)|
| 4:14:03| in saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15243)|
| 4:14:04| once we get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15244)|
| 4:14:05| and we make something up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15245)|
| 4:14:06| of what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15246)|
| 4:14:08| I don't want to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15248)|
| 4:14:09| do away with the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15249)|
| 4:14:10| but I don't want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15250)|
| 4:14:11| to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15251)|
| 4:14:12| unlimited power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15252)|
| 4:14:13| to take over too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| Because I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15255)|
| 4:14:16| in the government itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15256)|
| 4:14:18| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15258)|
| 4:14:19| I really want to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15259)|
| 4:14:20| I've heard all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15260)|
| 4:14:22| and I'm not really sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15262)|
| 4:14:24| what we should be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15264)|
| 4:14:25| I think what we should be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15265)|
| 4:14:26| is caring for each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15266)|
| 4:14:28| and see how best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15268)|
| 4:14:29| take care of each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| and not thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15271)|
| 4:14:32| just ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| But how can we take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15274)|
| 4:14:35| of one another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| I'm going to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15279)|
| 4:14:40| this real hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15280)|
| 4:14:41| I'm going to pray about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15281)|
| 4:14:42| which I do every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15282)|
| 4:14:44| My wife makes me do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15284)|
| 4:14:45| when I come home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15285)|
| 4:14:46| from a commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15286)|
| 4:14:47| to make sure that I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15287)|
| 4:14:48| for forgiveness for thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15288)|
| 4:14:49| that I've been thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15289)|
| 4:14:50| but not about some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15290)|
| 4:14:51| of my other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15291)|
| 4:14:53| Randy, I'm not talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15293)|
| 4:14:54| about you this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15294)|
| 4:14:56| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15296)|
| 4:14:58| I'm really listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15298)|
| 4:14:59| to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15299)|
| 4:15:01| I took notes one night before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15301)|
| 4:15:02| from 45 of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15302)|
| 4:15:04| that spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15304)|
| 4:15:05| I took notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15305)|
| 4:15:06| and thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15306)|
| 4:15:07| And the one thing I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15307)|
| 4:15:08| that you wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15308)|
| 4:15:09| live your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15309)|
| 4:15:10| as you want to live it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15310)|
| 4:15:12| but you've also got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15312)|
| 4:15:13| live your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15313)|
| 4:15:14| to where you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15314)|
| 4:15:15| interfering with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15315)|
| 4:15:16| somebody else's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15316)|
| 4:15:18| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15318)|
| 4:15:19| I want to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15319)|
| 4:15:20| I want to see what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15320)|
| 4:15:21| going to be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15321)|

| 4:15:24| are we going to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15324)|
| 4:15:25| something next Monday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15325)|
| 4:15:26| Are we going to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15326)|
| 4:15:27| anything forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15327)|
| 4:15:29| Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15329)|
| 4:15:30| all we have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=15330)|
