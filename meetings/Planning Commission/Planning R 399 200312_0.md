| 0:01:28| Many of the items we vote on require further action by the city council or county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| and in the handout is the meeting schedule for these legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| For matters that are forwarded to the county commission for final action, particularly rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=99)|

| 0:02:28| On certain items, I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| The applicant and those in support of the applicant will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=161)|

| 0:03:19| and should avoid repeating comments that have previously been presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| The commission may choose to extend the time allowed for both parties and may ask questions of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=204)|

| 0:11:43| Before we get started with our meeting, I'm going to turn the floor over to Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| This commission and the staff often have to consider contentious items and make recommendations which don't please everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=712)|
| 0:12:01| Staff represents these recommendations at many meetings and often go to meetings at which they're confronted regarding these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=721)|
| 0:12:09| In the recent past couple of weeks, at a public meeting, staff was confronted regarding a recommendation passed made unanimously by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| and treated in a lesser than respectful manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| This is not appropriate and it serves only to demean the character of the person making those types of comments and treating the staff that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=742)|

| 0:12:32| If you have a challenge with my staff, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| If you have a challenge with the recommendation made by this commission, let the chair know or the member of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| But do not treat the staff of this organization in a demeaning, belittling, or unrespectful manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Commissioner Greb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Yeah, I have a question before we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| We postponed item number six, and the number on that is 10B19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=776)|
| 0:13:07| It means October, we've been postponing, postponing, postponing, postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=787)|
| 0:13:15| Are we going to table this or vote on it next month or what are we going to do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you for that great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| I'm going to allow Mr. Green to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| And this is a matter that has generated a great deal of conversation and communication between the applicant and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| The neighborhood has worked hard with the applicant to come to some compromise and agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| The applicant recently retained an attorney who's helping facilitate that conversation, and they're still working with the retaining of that attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=821)|
| 0:13:52| The conversation has expanded somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| They're working hard to come to this commission with something that meets the needs of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| and is acceptable to the neighborhood, and that's why it's being prolonged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| to allow that conversation hopefully to result in something that's positive for everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| We hope soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| We hope soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| And I think the neighborhood hopes soon and the applicant certainly hopes soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Again, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| We're going to move on to agenda item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| This is the consideration of amendments to the Knoxville one-year plan 2020 update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| The staff recommendation is to recommend approval of the 2020 one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| I'm going to ask Amy Brooks to present this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=878)|
| 0:14:48| Yes, so I gave quite a lengthy presentation at the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| I'll just reiterate that this is the annual preparation and adoption that's required by the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| And as we did last year, staff has used a variety of tools to reach out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| They've included notices in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| On our website, we had three public meetings that were attended by approximately 35 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| A number of objectives were identified, improving the consistency of the one-year plan and our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| This has been a goal of ours over the last few years, reducing redundancies between the one-year plan and sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| and commuting conflicts through online mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| And so just real briefly, I won't go over in extensive detail as I did on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| but there are 14 staff amendments being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| There's 12 amendments approved by city council since the 2019 update, which we need to incorporate into the 2020 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=934)|
| 0:15:43| And then Attachment 1 in your packet includes more detail on all 26 of these proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| The staff proposed amendments include annexation requests that were approved by the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| and several amendments recognizing misalignments with the approved sector plan and land use designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| We also have a summary of edits that are included in Attachment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| I went over those in quite a bit of detail on our Tuesday agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| I do want to point out that we would like to also recommend as part of this approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| is that to provide consistency and correct a drafting error between the development policies in Chapter 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| and the Land Use Classifications Table in Appendix B, adding back in the South Waterfront Mixed Use District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| which is SWMUD, and the South Waterfront Mixed Use District 2, which is SWMUD2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| into Appendix B, Land Use Classifications Table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| and deleting SW from the list of the one-year permitted zones in the Mixed Use Urban Corridor MU-UC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| This is just to make it consistent with the 2019 update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| And if anyone has any questions, I'm happy to entertain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| Okay, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Yes, thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| With that, I'd like to make a motion to reinsert South Waterfront Mixed Use District SWMUD-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| and South Waterfront Mixed Use District 2 SWMUD-2 into Appendix B, Land Use Classifications Table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1026)|
| 0:17:15| and delete SW from the list of one-year permitted zones in the Mixed Use Urban Corridor MU-UC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1035)|
| 0:17:25| I'll second Commissioner Hill's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| I'm not going to read that whole motion over, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| but we do have a motion by Commissioner Hill with regards to Appendix B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| Is that correct, Appendix B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1067)|

| 0:17:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Motion to approve the one-year plan amendment with the amendment read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1083)|

| 0:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1089)|

| 0:18:13| to approve the 2020 one-year plan with the previously approved change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1093)|

| 0:18:57| And should I read these into the record all at once before we discuss and vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1144)|

| 0:24:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Our plans are just to put a single-family dwelling home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| So, I was hoping we could get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| So, you are, basically our vote is to approve the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| You're understanding that? That's what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Okay. So, I didn't want to make sure that you understood and didn't have any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Okay. Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you, Madam Chair. Motion to approve R-A, low-density residential zoning because it is consistent with the North County Sector Plan's LDR designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1514)|
| 0:25:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| I see no lights on. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1536)|

| 0:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Agenda item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| The applicant is Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| The location is the north side of Oak Grove Lane, east of Lions View Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| The approximate size of the tract is 0.95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| The present zoning is R-N-1, single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| The zoning requested is R-N-2, single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| The existing land use is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| And the staff recommendation is to approve R-N-2 zoning because it is consistent with the West City Sector Plan designation of LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1577)|
| 0:26:27| low-density residential land use classification for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| Sir, do you want to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| No, I'll yield to my opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| He's the applicant, and he has the option to speak first or defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| The reason I request that he go first is we just received information this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| Can you give us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| My name is Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| There was new information that arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| For me, I only saw it at 1230 this morning, this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| And so it would be very helpful if the applicant would go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| I could give my argument, but then I would ask for time after he speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| Well, you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| You could give your argument and reserve some time, and then you will be able to speak after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| That sounds fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| I need to get my material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| So what we're concerned about, and all of the commissioners received a letter from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| along with my other two neighbors who we, the three of us, own the other houses on Oak Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1667)|
| 0:27:55| We've all lived there for more than 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| And we are not opposed to what Mr. Jernigan has proposed initially in terms of keeping the existing house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1678)|
| 0:28:11| and adding a couple of other houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| That would be within his right as RN1, even with the 10,000 square feet requirement with RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1694)|
| 0:28:24| But we are concerned if RN2 is granted or is recommended by the planning commission and then it will go to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1704)|
| 0:28:35| we're concerned that this opens up the possibility of having much greater density than that parcel can bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1715)|
| 0:28:45| both because of the nature of the parcel itself and because of the narrowness of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| but also because of the difficulty of getting on and off Oak Grove Lane onto Lions View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| The fact that it is part of LDR sector zone is fine, but that is only one factor among many that need to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1737)|
| 0:29:11| With that, I would like to hand out, if I have time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| I would like to hand out some material that I prepared that does not show Mr. Jernigan's site plan for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1758)|
| 0:29:27| but does show the property in relation to the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1767)|
| 0:29:35| Okay, we will pause the clock while you get the materials to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you. Mr. Briscoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| This is for planning director and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| This is for the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1789)|
| 0:30:10| Let's wait until we all have something in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1810)|
| 0:30:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| So our objections included the topography that would lead to runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| as well as the narrowness of the road with the possibility of increased traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| and the difficulty of negotiating on Oak Grove Lane and getting on and off Oak Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| You will see in the first page the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| The site is outlined in black, and there is from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1866)|
| 0:31:18| Ms. English, could you pull the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| I have some technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| On the podium, there is a black button that turns off the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| Somehow you are leaning on something that enables the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Do a testing, one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1895)|
| 0:31:44| Mr. Reynolds, could you go and check and see what our technical difficulties are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| So there is a total decline of more than 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| If you look at it from the lower left corner to the upper right corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| those topology, basically it goes from 926 elevation down to under to below 920,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1934)|
| 0:32:27| right about at 906 elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| So that is a significant drop, and we are concerned that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1953)|
| 0:32:41| particularly if it was built out to our end to the possibilities there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| you could have probably up to eight dwelling units on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| which would lead to a lot of surface rubble and, in addition, a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| If you look at the second page, this is a photo that I took this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| It shows how narrow the road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| It also shows the effect of having parking along the street with a car pulling out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| So those are some of our concerns, as well as, for us, the character of our street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| and the fact that our end, too, has also been added to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| the larger neighborhood, with recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| So I will defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Okay. Thank you, Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. Jernigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2028)|
| 0:33:57| Victor Jernigan, 229 Sherway Road, Knoxville 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| I certainly appreciate the staff's input into this particular zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| I met with—this is an unusual piece of property in that it's an acre of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| in one of the most desirable residential areas in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| And as I approached the zoning originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| you can see that the adjoining property became RN6 under the recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| And the RN6—this property effectively could be bisected by an RN6 line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| And the original goal, quite seriously, was to look at developing housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| to create a diversity of opportunity in this particular zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| This is across from Lakeshore Park. It's next to the Veterans' Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| It's a phenomenal opportunity for people who are downsizing out of some of the larger homes in Westmoreland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| and for young professionals who can't afford to live in some of the other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| that adjoin this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| And so as I was looking at the plan originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| we looked at bisecting the property with an RN6 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| leaving a single-family house next to the other properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| and then building some townhomes sort of along what would be the RN6 half of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| After talking with Elsbeth and the neighbors and talking with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| the neighbors are legitimately concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| They have lived there forever. They have beautiful homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| I mean, the landscaping, the way in which they've done additions to their homes is just really excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| And so they were nice enough to have a meeting at their house December the 18th at Elsbeth's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| and we talked about the range of options which I was looking at doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| one of which was to develop the property into...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| My least desirable option would be to develop it into four lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| but that I would be happy to develop it into four lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| if that would make them satisfied with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| And so I had the conversation with staff as to thoughts about being able to get this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| and looked at the design plans, and quite seriously, since October of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| have been working on different designs and different ideas for the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| I had originally promised Elsbeth and Meribeth that I would have their plans back by the middle of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| Unfortunately, the architects and my schedule didn't quite get worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| and we didn't get plans back that I was satisfied with until earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| I have a copy of a preliminary site plan showing four lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| and an elevation and the footprint of the house that we are going to be using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| and I only unfortunately have one copy, but I'd be happy to pass this around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| so you can see that we're working through the process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| In the meeting we had on December 18th, I understand their concerns as far as traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| as far as queuing of people on and off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| and issues that are certainly important, stormwater, managing the control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| So we're looking at using pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| It's a short road, be it a private road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| but using pavers and other benefits of the way in which properties can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| under the recode process to create some real flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| The plans that are going around are what I call proof of concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| There are four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| You could build four of those houses that we have attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| That particular house has been modified a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| but we're sort of mimicking some developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| that show beautifully designed homes with well-landscaped lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2264)|
| 0:37:53| with close proximity to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| The people who will be living in this neighborhood in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| have what I refer to as time flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| This will not be inexpensive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| and the fact that there is definitely traffic on Lions View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| there's no question about that from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| but the issue gets to be that we view the majority of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| who will live in these houses will have flexibility of scheduling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| just as these ladies have flexibility of scheduling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| that they don't have to be somewhere at a specific time every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| And so the traffic issue for coming and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| will be substantially mitigated coming off of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| But additionally, Brightville Nursing Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| which has 250, 200 cars coming and going every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| also accesses this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| and doesn't appear to have created any additional problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| in all the years that it's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| So it is something that we're aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| but we're working for it in the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| One of the issues that we had with the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| when we were working through it was to be sure that the site plan –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| we wanted to save the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| The house was – it would have been easy to tear the house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| Actually, maybe it would have been a much easier process, candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| to have torn the house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Mr. Jernigan, your time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Do you have just a little bit to finish up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| I do. Just one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| I very much appreciate the input from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| I've made every effort to meet with them and keep them informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| The plan is in keeping with what the staff has recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| and I do ask you to support the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| to change the zone to an R2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Ms. Inglis, you have just a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| If I could, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| The usual statement that at a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| the plans that are presented cannot be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| What you have to consider is all the uses permitted under the proposed zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| The development scenario identified by Mr. Jernigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| as a subdivision would come back to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| If that's his intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| come back before the Commission for a review as a concept plan and use under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| If Mr. Jernigan decided to do duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| that would be a special use and would be reviewed by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| So although you can't consider those plans at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| if the rezoning is approved as the development moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| there would be an opportunity to review the plans for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Ms. Inglis, I have three quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| The first is that all of the RN6 is, as Mr. Jernigan said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| the nursing home that's down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| It used to be Brakeville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| It is now Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| The only reason that it is RN6 is that is the zoning for a residential care facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| under the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| So I regard it as irrelevant to what happens up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| Literally up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Second, there is no need for RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| If Mr. Jernigan wishes to do the four houses that he's proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| he could do, as I think I've mentioned, two additional as of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| He could get variances, most likely easier to get variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| to achieve the additional fourth house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| And then finally, he is less familiar with the parking problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| and more specifically the exit problems from Brakeville than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| We often have to be careful about when we come down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| cars don't look up the road and there are accidents waiting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| One comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Ms. English said that Mr. Jernigan would likely be able to get variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| The standard for obtaining a variance is a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Identifying a hardship when you're creating a new development is challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| when there are no physical characteristics of the property that would warrant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| So I would add a caution to that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| I would add that topography is mentioned as a hardship in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| For existing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Commissioner Wuerl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Ms. Albertson, can you, for the sake of the people involved in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| just kind of give us a brief overview of RN-1 and RN-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| I will start by reading the description in the new zoning ordinance for RN-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2553)|
| 0:42:41| and versus RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| They're both characterized as single-family residential neighborhood zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| RN-1 is intended to accommodate traditional low-density residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| exhibiting a predominant development pattern of single-family homes on relatively large lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| with generous setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Two-family dwellings may also be allowed by special use approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| and limited non-residential uses that are compatible with the character of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| may also be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| RN-2 is also characterized as a low-density single-family residential development area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2590)|
| 0:43:20| on relatively smaller lots with smaller setbacks within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Two-family dwellings may also be allowed by special use approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| and limited non-residential uses that are compatible with the character of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| may also be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| When it comes to dimensional standards for the two districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| under RN-1, the minimum lot size for a single-family lot is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| Under RN-2, the minimum lot size for a single-family lot is 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| Under RN-2, under special use review, as Mr. Green noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| a duplex or two-family dwelling, the minimum lot size is 15,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| Under RN-2, the minimum lot size for a duplex or two-family dwelling is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| So we're basically looking at the square footage of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| as the big difference between the two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Yes, I just wanted to make a comment about the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| that what is being shown may not be what's being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| but Victor Jarnagan has been before this commission for at least 30 years, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| and I've never heard the first negative word on anything that he's done in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2679)|
| 0:44:47| And if he didn't build this exact house, it would be something comparable, and it would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| I just feel that way, and I don't know him personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| but he's appeared here for more than 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Commissioner Easton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| I think staff presented a comparison of the number of single-family houses and the number of duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| Could you repeat that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Yeah, just a quick estimate of potential density based on minimum lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| If it were RN-1 and you did all single-family lots at at least 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| since the lot itself is about 42,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| they could potentially fit four lots on the property for a single-family residential under RN-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| And in RN-2, since the minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| they could potentially fit probably up to eight lots for a single-family residential dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2746)|
| 0:45:56| Under duplex as special use, which would be for both RN-1 and RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| the RN-1, they could potentially have three 15,000 square feet lots for duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| and under the RN-2, they could potentially have up to four duplex lots of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2769)|
| 0:46:20| Just for clarification, the site plan that came past us, that had four lots, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| And so you could do what you wanted to do with the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| The lots are below 10,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| So the issue in the site plan that we sent around is, in the RN-2 zone, we can get those lots on those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2796)|
| 0:46:48| We're looking to make this a really attractive development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| and work within the guidelines of what the neighbors would like to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| and it also works out to be a nice development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| But when you look at where the road detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| the road is going to be laid out to create a buffer that exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| There's what I would call an overgrown hedge, but it's a nice wooded, in the spring and summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| it's a really nice little screened area, and so we're staying off of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| And so we're creating a little more buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| using some design ideas that make it possible to build the four houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| We haven't, and again, this is just a, Mr. Green, and the zoning goes with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| It's not with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| I understand that perfectly, and I very much appreciate the kind words, Mr. Grafitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| The situation is that we're looking to show our good intent to develop the property in the way that I have agreed with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| I have an e-mail from them in January saying that they would support the four lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| and we've been moving forward with getting it done to be able to get it laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| And so to get it laid out, we needed the surveyors, and everybody's tried to get a surveying crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| It's been a little hard in the rain here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| And so we literally have just got it all put together just in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| And so we think that this, it's going to require some additional tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| It's going to look different when we bring it into plan, but it won't look a lot different than what I presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| It will be a four lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| I'd like to thank the neighborhood and Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| We can't consider any of that, Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| But I'd like to make a motion that we approve RN2, Single-Family Residential Neighborhood Zoning District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| because it's consistent with the West City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| Mr. Jernigan, did you have something else you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| No, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Just before we vote, I wanted to say that I appreciate what's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| but since the zoning goes with the property, I'm afraid of the density that could come with another development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2945)|

| 0:49:39| Location is the west side of South Gallaher View Road, north of Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=2979)|

| 0:51:23| Next on the agenda is item number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| The applicant is Gerald Green, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3090)|

| 0:52:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| This is a bit unusual as a plan amendment without a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| The zoning is currently residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| The plan is stated as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| This is due to an error on the part of staff in a sector plan that was, I believe, was 2003?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| And then it was carried forward in the updated sector plan in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| This does not change the zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| It does enable the sector plan designation to be compatible and permit the zoning that's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| We apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| We're not catching this quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| It was brought to our attention when there was an application for a development in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| that since has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| But this plan amendment is necessary in order to, again, make the zoning compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| with the sector plan designation and for the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| to actually permit the zoning that's already on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Appreciate that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| I see no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Is there anyone in the audience that wishes to talk to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3200)|

| 0:53:38| when the northwest county sector plan was comprehensively updated in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3218)|

| 0:55:13| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3320)|
| 0:55:29| We were here back in January with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3329)|
| 0:55:38| We were requested to engage with other interested people about the subject matter of the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3338)|
| 0:55:49| There had been a requirement for sidewalks, but the sidewalks were not built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| and frankly can't be built to meet the requirements of ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| So there were a number of potential parties in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| This was postponed to give time for those parties to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| and see if there's something that we can all or most all agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| We met, I'd say there were 14 or 15 people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| representatives of county engineering including Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| I know Leo was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| There were a number of people from city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| There were representatives from the Spadina Place Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| My client and I were also there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| I'd say we had quite a crowd, but the result of that was to reach an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| that rather than deal with or try to deal with sidewalks inside that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| that there's a project by the city to make road improvements along Pleasant Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| and install a certain amount of sidewalk with us to pick up at the point where the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3435)|
| 0:57:25| in essence, wasn't going to build a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| We agreed then to build that sidewalk from that point to roughly the corner of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3449)|
| 0:57:39| If you look in your package of material at the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| in there the one that looks like this, this being the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| in the bottom third of the page is Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| You'll see from right about the middle of the bottom third of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3475)|
| 0:58:05| there's an area where you see about five dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| That's the part of the sidewalk that we have agreed to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| The consequence of that meeting and what was outlined at that point was agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| and preferred by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| I don't know whether the homeowners have a representative here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| I didn't imagine that they would, but they were clearly in support of what we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3507)|
| 0:58:37| and what we were willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| As a result of all that, what we need, as Madam Chair pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| is a motion to deny our request for removal of the condition of sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3525)|
| 0:58:57| So you deny that request and put in place of that condition a new condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| that describes the responsibility of the client as far as putting in sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| in accordance with everybody's agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| Is there any comments from Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| I do have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| Everybody's in agreement, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| My comments are I don't think that the Planning Commission or the staff, any of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3570)|
| 0:59:40| should be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| We don't hold the bond on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| The bond is for streets and sidewalks inside that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| Whatever the engineering department wants to do and the applicant and homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3594)|
| 1:00:02| that's between them, but I really don't feel that we should ever have been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| other than to get a letter from the county engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| and say we would be satisfied if you remove the requirement for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3615)|
| 1:00:26| That should be our only, I think, our only involvement in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| I don't think we should have been part of the deal making or any part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| because once it leaves here, and we say this over and over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| that once it leaves here, it's up to the engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| it's up to so-and-so to see that the landscaping gets in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| it's up to somebody else to see that the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| and the detention ponds are built properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| It's not our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| We kind of wash our hands of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| I don't know why we're taking this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| I'm not going to make a motion or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| but I don't think we should have ever considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Mr. Breschke, do you have anything that you would like to say or Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| It's in the staff report as far as our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| Short and sweet. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| I will not debate Commissioner Graf's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| but I will make a motion because I think it is in the best interest of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| and the developer to deny the applicant's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| to eliminate the sidewalk requirement condition of the concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| Do I need to continue on and say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| No, we're going to be taking two separate votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| and we have another commissioner's light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Okay, so we have a motion by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| seconded by Commissioner Buston to deny the applicant's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| to eliminate the sidewalk requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| This question for Mr. Green or for the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| at what point will the commission need to actually not require sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| within the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| The county passed a sidewalk ordinance which sets standards for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3747)|
| 1:02:38| Compliant with that ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| this commission has little authority to require sidewalks in new subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| In fact, that ordinance makes it challenging to provide sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| in new subdivisions in the county outside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| because it requires those sidewalks if provided other than on the frontage street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| to be maintained by the homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| which makes it challenging to provide sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Your ability to require sidewalks is extremely limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| Yeah, I understand that, but this was done well before that was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| I just think there needs to be some motion at some point, not necessarily today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| but in the future where we acknowledge that sidewalks are not needed in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| and vote respectfully to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Just releasing the bond does not release them from the obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| But I do agree with the motion, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Yeah, did you say that we're going to vote twice on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| There's two separate votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| The second one is to approve the revised sidewalk condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| So the first one is to deny the applicant's request to eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| But shouldn't it all be made in one motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| I will leave that to the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| We can deny it and then deny the second one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| I'll just say that it makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| but the procedure for subdivisions requires us to break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| One is the approval of the, I think in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| and also it makes it more clear that first we're denying the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| to remove the condition in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| and instead we're denying that and then we're taking another vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| to insert a new condition, a revised condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| It just makes it more clear and more firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| I've just got my light on so I can make the second motion when we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| Okay, prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Okay, so we have a motion by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| second by Commissioner Buston to deny the applicant's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| to eliminate sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Commissioner Graf, did you have something else to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| I would like to make a motion we approve the following sidewalk revised condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| The applicant should be responsible for constructing a section of sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| within the public right-of-way of Pleasant Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| in the area identified on the attached maps as sidewalk improvement area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Since the proposed sidewalk will be located within the public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| for the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| the sidewalk shall meet all applicable requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| of the Americans with Disabilities Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| and the City of Knoxville Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| once the developers obtain approval from the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| for the proposed sidewalk improvements and post a bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| with the City for the installation of the sidewalk improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| of Knox County Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| or release any unused bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| for spradling place subdivision to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| And I'd like to tell Mr. Hill that I'd have swapped with you on the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| That's the longest motion ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| a second by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| and I'm going to abbreviate that to approve the following revised sidewalk condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Nothing further yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Nothing for me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| We are on to agenda item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| The applicant is Space Mart Development Company, LP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| The location is the northwest side of East Hill Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| south side George Dempster Drive and James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Approximate size of the tract is 4.73 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| The zoning is C2 Central Business District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Existing land use is office building and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Proposed use is indoor climate-controlled self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| Staff's recommendation is to approve the indoor climate-controlled self-storage unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| used with approximately 117,200 square feet of floor area subject to five conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4023)|
| 1:07:13| and I meant to say that this is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| Applicant, do you wish to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| My name is Jeff Grubb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| My address is 2009 Coleto Street, Austin, Texas, 78722.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4065)|
| 1:07:55| I want to start by saying a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| I'm the president and owner of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I started my company over 20 years ago with my partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| To date, we've developed over 10,000 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| and a million square feet of quality self-storage projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Our most recent projects include properties in New York City and Miami,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| and the Miami project in particular will become germane here a little bit later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| as I talk about what we did with that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| and how we were able to preserve the balance of the site for multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| Real quick, I want to let you know we're really excited about coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| There are really good fundamentals here, especially in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| We see over 9,000 multifamily units within two miles of our site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| We see a lot of professional offices, a lot of business people downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| yet only one other professional climate-controlled self-storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| and that's not even two miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| That's within four miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| So we're excited about being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| We want to do a very high-end, high-quality climate-controlled facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| to serve professionals and downtown residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Our plans are to improve the vacant office building and put it back into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| I think we've shared some elevations with you all that show we've worked with staff quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| In fact, I think we delayed a month to make sure we were being responsive to staff sensitivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| to the exterior of the building to make sure it was appropriate to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| So our plans are to, again, put a vacant building back into use, improve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| but then also to preserve the majority of the site for future multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| We put this property under contract in September of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| and my very first direction to our engineers was to lay out a conceptual site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| for multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| This is something we've done recently at our Miami development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| We renovated an existing building on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| and then we wound up selling or putting under contract to a national developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| the balance of the two acres of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| I think they're doing 268 apartment units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| We understand there's value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| My direction to the engineer has been please preserve as much of the site as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| for future use, for another use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| It's enabled by our storage use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Our use is very quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| We don't need a lot of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| I think the staff report and the Institute of Transportation Engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| shows 117 trips a day on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| I've actually looked at some of my other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| and we're far under that with no peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| So the nice thing is for our use, we just don't need much parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| which enables us to preserve the majority of the site for another use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| and we think that use is multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| And I mentioned we had success with that approach at our Miami location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| so I've engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Cushman Wakefield brokered that project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| And, by the way, I have some handouts that show that project that's going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4249)|
| 1:10:56| Am I able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| We'll stop the clock while you get those to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4268)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| So while Mike's passing that out, I'll just mention – can I start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| I'll just mention that we've engaged Cushman Wakefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| the same firm that helped us on that site, to help us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| They're reporting good interest on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| They like the fact – their national developer clients like the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| it's got good river views, it's got good proximity to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| and it's in an opportunity zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| So, you know, we're enthusiastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| We're getting good response from the national developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| What we have to do, we believe, is answer the question about what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| with that big vacant building to basically take that overhang,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| that concern to the developers out of the equation so they can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| So we like our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| We aren't sending the building to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| We think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| We understand there's some opposition here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| including from the River Hill Gateway Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Our offer to meet with them was respectfully declined, and that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| we are disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| We think we had some good stuff to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| development that's going to be good for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| and going to enable a good high-quality multifamily development to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| We have 49 seconds left if you wish to talk after the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Were you the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| My name is Mark Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| and I represent the River Hill Gateway Neighborhood Association as president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| At this time, I would like to recognize and ask that my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| and others that are here on this matter in opposition to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| I would like to also point out that you have received many letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| from us objecting to this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| and want to make sure that it's part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| I won't repeat comments already made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| other than to say that I think a – or we think a self-storage facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| makes absolutely no sense for a key property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| in the downtown Knoxville Boulevard zone at the gateway to the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| So the facts are this type of use is not allowed except on use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| which is why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| And I'd like to highlight three points about the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| Number one, the review and approval process is intended, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| to provide for uses which are beneficial to the community, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| My question to this is, how is a self-storage facility beneficial to our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| Have you heard from anyone other than the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| who believes that a self-storage facility is beneficial to our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| Number two, the review and approval process is intended to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| integrate properly the uses permitted on review with other uses in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| Since the proposed use cannot be integrated with other uses in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| the zoning requires that the facility must have the appearance of an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| In other words, it has to be distinguished or disguised as an office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| in order to fit into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| The applicant intends to preserve excess frontage along East Hill Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| for future development, but this is not part of their current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| nor is it a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| And a four-story concrete storage facility is still part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| Number three, the review and approval process is intended to approve a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| quote, where it can be shown that the proposed plan or use is in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| and with the general plan and the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| and is reasonably necessary for the convenience and welfare of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| I believe that you've heard from the community members that a self-storage facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| is not necessary for the convenience and welfare of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| We appreciate the opportunity to be a part of the planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| and hope that you've heard our concerns and take appropriate action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| and deny this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| We believe we can do better than this for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| Looks like Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| One, I would like to ask Director Green a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| and then I'd like to get the city's input from Deputy Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| and then I may have a question or two for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| But while she's, if she's willing to comment, Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| I think we need to be looking at this through the lens of C2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| because that was what the application was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| And this may sound like a rhetorical question, but it's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| If, and I'm not sure how I feel about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| but if this is not an appropriate location in C2 for self-storage, where would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4610)|
| 1:16:59| I know it wouldn't be on Gay Street and it wouldn't be on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Where would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| That's a challenging one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| This site, although one of the reasons it was included in the downtown zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| is to try to bring it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| We understand the road configuration in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| creates almost a suburban island in the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| And how do we incorporate this into the downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| And the zoning was part of that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| Deputy to the Mayor Welch will address others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| but I think the longer-range plan for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| if that is brought to fruition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| and there may be some ways to guarantee that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| would help make this more a part of the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| by creating multi-family, especially a more urban feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| The site plan that was just provided to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| shows those buildings up on the street, the parking back behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I think that starts creating that urban feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| I admit I try to keep my personal biases out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| I think storage units are not the best use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| and that people have too much stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| But Commissioner Buston pointed out that there are a number of residents downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| who don't have a place to store things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| So I think it's one of those times when I'm glad I don't get a vote with this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| because it is a challenging thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| But I do think, back to your question, this likely is an appropriate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| The key is how do we guarantee a more urban-type development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| that it's not just a storage facility in the middle of a large parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| And again, there may be a way to guarantee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| through conditions placed on any approval that the commission may make of this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| May I start with just a question or concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| Before you go, Deputy Welch, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| I look at this as a very low-impact use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| and hopefully the market will allow multifamily around it, and I think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| I always think what could be the worst use and what would be the most likely demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| And as I think through a developer's lens, I see this being an ideal call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| I would hate for that to be a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| I mean, you get a lot of cars during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| They don't utilize the assets around you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| and then they go home back to the suburbs or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| So with that, as that being a potential use because that is permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| the call center is permitted in that zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| I think we should look at everything that could happen that is not based on use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Thanks, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| I'm the Chief of Economic and Community Development for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| and Deputy to Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| It may be just helpful to provide you some address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Yes, 3213 South Haven Road or 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Depends on the time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Mostly 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| So it may just be helpful to look at the context of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| I think that, you know, if I were in your shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| I would be thinking about that as to the appropriateness of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| So right now there's a lot going on in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| I'm really excited about some of the attention that's being paid to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| The parcel that is immediately to the east of this particular parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| is actually under a development agreement right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| We have a local philanthropist, Jim Clayton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| who is generously donating $150 million science center to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| and it will be right next door to this particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| So I think that's an important thing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| We actually just met with Mr. Clayton and his team yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| and just this week city council voted to close a portion of a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| that will help consolidate that parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| so that we can continue to move forward with that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| It's a really exciting investment in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| Of course, you all are probably aware of the urban wilderness gateway park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| that's going in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| It may not seem like that would be at all related to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| However, the long-range plan is to create a corridor park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| a linear park between the urban wilderness and really pretty much this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| It will terminate in proximity to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| Obviously, there's a lot of residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| that's popped up along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| I personally drive or ride my bike up and down that corridor on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| Over the last couple of years, there's been a lot more activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| pedestrian, bicycle activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| I think the city is very interested in finding ways to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| to activate that corridor as a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| between all of this really wonderful development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| that's happening in that area and our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| I will say that it would be great to see this site developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| into a sort of multi-use site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| I think the storage facility alone, I guess my question to you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| how can that help us as a city activate that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| which is really important for the economic vibrancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| and to make sure that we're capitalizing on the investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| that the city, private investors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| and our local philanthropic community is making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| Does that help, Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| Did you have any other questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| You may not want to go very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Other people might have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| Mr. Green, the site plan that the applicant presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| I know this isn't a concept or just an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| Can we hold them to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| I agree that just having a storage facility out there by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| is not in the best interest of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| but I think with a multifamily development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| as they're showing on this, it certainly makes a lot more sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| and I think the appearance of the building does have an office feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| Not a great deal of impact on the surrounding roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| but can we require, can the Commissioner require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| that the residential component be a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| and conditional to the storage facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| The lease owner review approval process does permit conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| to be attached to any approval that the Commission provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| so a motion that incorporated a condition related to this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| conceptual site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| or some aspect of a multifamily development on that parcel would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| and would be a way to tie the multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| to approval of the existing building for a storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| Commissioner Uden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Yeah, I was kind of tracking along the same lines as Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| This one's a tough one for me because I see all sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Mr. Green's tenure, especially over the past handful of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| he's been very, and staff has been very forward thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| with property that we have to try to get the city moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| with just a numerous amount of things he's done recently with recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| and it bothers me somewhat that we've got a month's worth of technicality on zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| that would have gotten it into a new downtown Knoxville Boulevard zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| that this might not have even been an appropriate use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| or am I missing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| You're correct there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| So at the same time, obviously this building's been sitting there forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| and if you've got some guys that are ambitious enough to take that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| and come up with a good reuse, I think that's pretty awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| What I'm a little bit on the fence about here is when you've got the city saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| that they've got an opportunity to do something way out of the box for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| that to me is you get one shot at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| With this new site plan that they've brought in, adding these apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| I think that lends even more credibility to this team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| that's trying to get this thing done in my eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| I would like to maybe see this thing postponed for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| and maybe make sure we formally get those apartments on this site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| let the city take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| and ideally I would like to have city support behind this developer and this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5176)|
| 1:26:24| because I think them going on a limb and doing this with this many dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| that they're talking about and the adjoining development that's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| it's going to need a lot of hand-holding all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| So I don't know if that makes sense or not, but that's kind of what I'm thinking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| Commissioner Hill, I saw your light on and now it's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| Okay, Commissioner Easton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| I think I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| I don't want to see just the self-storage by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| I would love to see the apartments as part of the use and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| that we're actually reviewing rather than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| I'm not sure why it's not part of what we're actually reviewing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Mr. Grubb, is there a time frame in your plan as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5233)|
| 1:27:21| there you are, I couldn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| In your plan, you gave us this picture of the self-storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| and then the two residential buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| In your plan, are you planning on now developing these at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| or is there some kind of time frame in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| Our plan is to market that excess acreage to a national developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| We may partner with them, but we are self-storage developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| so we will select and work with a national developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| and market that acreage to them, just the same as we did at our Miami site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| But it's part of your proposed plan for this area to include that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| It's part of the, to include the multifamily acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Originally, we came in just with a self-storage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| I wasn't aware until just recently how desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| or how much this body and town desires a multifamily component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| I wish I would have kind of advertised that more up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| because that's exactly what our plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| That's the use we see going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| Economically, our project, I mean, our project works when we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| that's why I've been telling Aaron to kind of preserve as much space as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| for that multifamily development because that's what works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| That's what makes the economics all work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| So it's always been part of our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| but we didn't technically tie it to the self-storage approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| I agree with Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| I think that we need full support of the city going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| and making sure that this is the right use for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| as much as I would love to have a storage building downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| I also want there to be consensus, you know, with all the partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| And I'm also very disappointed that the community didn't meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| We have, I guess, for years now since I've been on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| we have really encouraged the communities to sit down with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| and the city and come up with a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| of what would be the best use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| The only thing that bothers me about the multiuse, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| I hope that you do build apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| We need them downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| As you know, I don't know how much you've spent down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| but I've only lived here like six years and I've seen this place explode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| And there is a use for more dwelling units downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| and we do need high density to get more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| However, the only thing that worries me is if there's an economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5399)|
| 1:30:07| of what's going on right now that that might be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| with getting money in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| That's something that I think we all ought to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| But I do want to, you know, just validate how much that I really feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| that we need to be all on the same page because this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| You can only get to do it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| For clarification to the applicant and me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| I would like to know since the multifamily was not a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| use on review, it's my understanding it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| It was presented to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| At what point in time do they lose their, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| vesting rights under the old code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| So if they delay until they get the multifamily laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5455)|
| 1:31:02| does it expire is what I'm asking you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| their application for the self-storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| If this commission agrees to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| that application that they submitted is still valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| and would be reviewed under the old ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| Only at the time that it's approved and they fail to provide application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5480)|
| 1:31:27| for a building permit and start construction within a certain period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| of time, then I think three years, then their vesting would end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| Or if it's denied and they take no action to appeal that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| then their vesting period ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| But, again, the postponement by this board, their application stays valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5501)|
| 1:31:50| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| My question is can you get a residential component put in in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5513)|
| 1:32:02| Certainly you can't get one that you've got contracts on in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| You can probably get a concept drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| We have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| You can submit that in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| And I will support a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| I'm just wondering, can we get everything put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| and get everybody on the same page in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| Is that realistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| I don't know who I'm asking that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| The key is Mr. Grubb, I think, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| Go ahead, Mr. Grubb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| What I understand is we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| We want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| What I'd like to do in that 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| what I'd like to start to do is try to figure out how, what's going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| what's going to give you all the assurance you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| that that use is going to go in there in a way that we can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| so we're able to still negotiate, still get financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| still negotiate with potential developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| I think we just need to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| and start to kind of come up with some ways where we can accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| And I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| And you'll probably get enough together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| but we need to get with the city and the city on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| This is a very dynamic area right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and just became so in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| Again, I'll support a 30-day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| but I would like to encourage the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| that is out here in opposition to meet with Mr. Grubb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| find out what they're thinking, what their concept is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| go in with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Maybe self-storage is not the best thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| but let's see if we can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Like Commissioner Hill said, the downside to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| it doesn't go through and you get a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| Or the building gets demolished and we fill up another landfill with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| and you still get a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| That is something that could happen without even coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| So this is low impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I know it's not ideal to have self-storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| especially a five-story self-storage building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| but there have been several around town that have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| that they look fine if you ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| And that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| I just wanted to say that I'm very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| I think there is a strong demand and a need for what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| Like everybody else, I feel like a 30-day postponement might be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| and it would be an opportunity for you, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| and the residents to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| So I'm going to go ahead and make a motion that we postpone this item for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith, a second by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| I just really have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| I'm so excited about the science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| And right next door is a storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| And it seems to me like there's so much more potential for things that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| happen right next door to a science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| You said that the closest climate-controlled self-storage is four miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| Well, a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| this commission approved climate-controlled self-storage on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| which is about 1.65 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| I know because I drive that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| So it's not like four miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| We've got one that's very much closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| But it just really concerns me that using this property for self-storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| that I'd like to see, along with the multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| I'd love to see some things that would be activities that are similar to what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| going to be attracting the people to the science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| So that being said, we do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| a second by Commissioner Clancy to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| How about a recess, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| That's exactly what I was going to suggest, is a 10-minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| Well, let's make it that we will reconvene at 3.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| That's a 14-minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I thought it would be 13 in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=5799)|

| 2:11:26| if they did build on them they would be a very different architectural style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7886)|

| 2:11:50| handful of developers since then but at that time this is why many of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| neighborhood believed that these were intended to be a common space was we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| were told that it was not buildable with the style of homes as we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| in the neighborhood and so there was a law or not commonly held belief that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| this would as the neighborhood filled up and as the HOA what the intention was is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| as we got voting rights in our HOA which we don't have today right now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7931)|

| 2:12:24| as the neighborhood filled up as more homeowners became owners that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| could vote to purchase that lot and to develop it into a community property the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| developer at the time I moved in didn't have an interest in doing it himself but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| stated that if the HOA wanted to that would be an option I myself to keep from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| having a detractable house go in would be glad to purchase it at a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| price but that's a secondary issue so our concerns we do agree that with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| setbacks the way that they are they can't build a house that would fit well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| into our neighborhood secondarily if the restrictions were changed if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| setbacks were changed you could potentially squeeze a house on there we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| believe it would be unsightly my house that sits next to it I recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| this issue is largely because my house is set back further than the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| that's it there 15 16 the house where they would have to put it would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=7992)|

| 2:13:25| our house which is fine but they would have to build essentially having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| house in my front yard or immediately adjacent to my front yard so we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| it would lower our property value I've taken some photos I understand some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8013)|

| 2:22:10| noise pollution and in regards to the light pollution which has me really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| concerned the lighting proposition is that there would be shielded down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8536)|
| 2:22:26| lighting on the poles at the parking areas and what I am requesting is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| those lights are used only during events and that those lights are not on 24-7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8553)|

| 2:23:37| have been brought to their knowledge when you talk about the 300 foot from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8617)|

| 2:24:22| lay this down please is that one is the traffic for KUB is very busy you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8662)|

| 2:24:54| is that he's not developed yet if that's possible they're looking into that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| now because primarily you want most the traffic because if not you could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| talking about a hundred extra cars on that road a day they'd like to see also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8702)|

| 2:25:12| event to limit the noise she's not sure what exactly is putting across from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| but it looks like it's the dumpsters and the animals and she's concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| about the runoff because the hillside coming into the creeks which are on her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8721)|

| 2:25:38| you give miss King two more minutes we will give you two more minutes on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8738)|

| 2:25:52| owners that we've looked at that also are around that property on the little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| Switzerland area there are joining properties and none of them have to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| best of our knowledge had any idea of this also when you look at the map so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| we'd like to give them a such chance out if seven days 30 days to at least give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| them a mailing or writing to know what's going on and as well as security is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| big issue especially if the lights are turned off if there's someone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| security if you've got two to three hundred people you need to have security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| there at all times and it's gonna be open for people to drive by it if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| roads not closed that's watching the property and controlling the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| that's something we have to do even in our own restaurant and if the lights are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| down because it is primary we need to worry about that also the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| as far as restrictions that they really want to see is to see if perhaps they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| could have instead of wooden fire pits gas fire pits because wooden fire pits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| that is a very area populated area above it with vegetation will cause embers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| just people throwing cigarettes down could cause fires so that would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| great benefit for us it's not that we're against that concept he's come closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| than I've ever seen him come to it as long as we are staying guidelines and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| he's not on a property across the other owners property that's the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| problem we've had with that the 300 foot buffer will give this token on the which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8827)|
| 2:27:12| is on John Norton Road it'll actually take that McCall branch which has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| jurisdictional waters also of the USA and we'd like to see those protected for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| the wildlife and no more chemicals for then there was more chemicals on one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| the palms this week so that's basically all we have to say is that if you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| give us time or think about the closing of the road getting some security in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| there for even parking a hundred cars I mean you've got cars come in that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| gonna be a busy road off Chapman Highway or severe pack but if the guest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| primarily which you want to route them into his took to his main entrance would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| not have a no thought no drive-thru signs on the other side they could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| through clearer and it wouldn't erupt with their everyone else's public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8872)|

| 2:28:29| conditions I do want to address a couple of the things items that were brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| today in regard to setbacks we want to fully comply with the 200 foot setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8914)|
| 2:28:42| from adjacent property owners that have not agreed to easements or encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| letters as well as 300 foot setback from adjoining residential structures so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| just want to make that clear that our intent is to fully comply with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| setbacks as far as creating a buffered space between the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8939)|
| 2:29:07| that was brought up we we would we would want to provide that landscape buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| the the ambience and the aesthetic that we're going for and this retreat center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8952)|
| 2:29:18| is one that is highly connected to nature and so we would you know having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8958)|
| 2:29:23| the connection to the adjacent properties is a little bit of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| detriment to our concept so we are in support of several of the items brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8966)|
| 2:29:31| up which would be thick landscape buffers as well as dark sky or shielded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| light requirements we would fully support that we do not want to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8977)|
| 2:29:43| this hill up like a hotel parking lot so our intent is to have low light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8983)|
| 2:29:47| pedestrian light safe light but yet lighting that is not intrusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| certainly casting light to the other properties in addressing security that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8992)|
| 2:29:59| is part of our narrative that was submitted with our application but I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| just go over it in a little bit of detail we we will have security guards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9002)|

| 2:30:44| you know whether it's a gas fireplace or wood-burning I think that's up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| discussion but we would we would like to have something more ancient than the gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9050)|
| 2:30:56| but you know if that's a requirement to move this project forward I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9056)|
| 2:31:00| would consider that thank you thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9060)|
| 2:31:06| I have heard some concerns about noise with this particular development and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9066)|
| 2:31:16| have in in reading some of the conditions for rural retreat I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9076)|
| 2:31:23| question about that I think condition four in the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| tree guidelines I'm not sure I'm addressing this too but says that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9087)|
| 2:31:32| advance with sound application of any kind between the hours of 9 p.m. and 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| a.m. must take place entirely within a fully enclosed building it's there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9097)|
| 2:31:43| section there also this is or that include 50 or more attendees between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| hours of 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. I'm not sure if those two conditions are or to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9106)|
| 2:31:54| together or separate but I do think the issue of sound is is a great concern I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9114)|
| 2:32:00| rather not have amplified sound within an open tent and to address that concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| in our narrative for operations we will not have sound application amplification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9125)|
| 2:32:10| after 9 p.m. so our events will be required to not be amplified during those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9130)|
| 2:32:15| hours of 99 I saw that and I think that may be difficult to actually regulate I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| think you put the condition on the on the the renter but as we all know with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9141)|
| 2:32:28| weddings and other celebrations sometimes it's difficult to cut things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| off right at 9 o'clock it would be part of the contract that would be signed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9152)|
| 2:32:37| the agreement I mean if someone wants to have a wedding go to midnight you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| would have to find another location will you be on site to require that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9162)|
| 2:32:48| actually leave at exactly 9 o'clock there is an operations team that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| on-site yes I think I still would prefer that amplification within an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9172)|
| 2:32:59| enclosed structure Commissioner Griff yeah as long as this process has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9179)|
| 2:33:10| going on on this piece of land it's been going on a year now and I'm really in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9190)|
| 2:33:16| favor of what they've finally come up with but I'm also in favor of a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9196)|
| 2:33:23| postponement to get the question I don't think 30 days makes a difference it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| already been a year let the the neighbors get comfortable with what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9209)|
| 2:33:36| going on maybe get some of these answers in writing as to the lighting and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9216)|
| 2:33:44| sound and that sort of thing just tidy it up a little bit for the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9224)|
| 2:33:50| concerned so I'll make a motion that we postpone for 30 days we have a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9230)|
| 2:33:59| Commissioner graph a second by Commissioner Buston to postpone for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9239)|

| 2:34:07| chair mr. green on your recommendation you'd mentioned item number two on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9247)|

| 2:34:17| facility I'm showing on the site plan it shows gravel parking but then you go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9257)|
| 2:34:27| to say that as approved by Knox County Public Works I mean would they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| they regulate the parking spaces in terms of being gravel or all-weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9272)|
| 2:34:39| they they would the I'm true in my memory of the rural retreat standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9279)|
| 2:34:48| may not be entirely clear and so I may defer to mr. Bruchko but the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| of the for the rural retreat I believe specifically state that the parking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| drive areas the surface is the purview of the Knox County engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9298)|
| 2:35:03| public works that's correct it's always concerning to have some other party that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9303)|
| 2:35:10| proves these things by thank you were you talking under the breath your breath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9310)|
| 2:35:15| or did you want to I couldn't hear what you said I said I'm always concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| when we have public works it's approving okay to yes mr. Levy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9319)|
| 2:35:33| I do respect the the motion for the 30-day postponement but I will indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| that I mean this has been a long drawn-out process and the the owner has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| individually met and reached out to the surrounding property owners had meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9343)|
| 2:35:49| so recently so this isn't a surprise to anybody and I think everyone's had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| chance to review the project to ask the questions that they want to ask and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| know at a certain point it's just time to move forward and get something done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9360)|
| 2:36:09| Commissioner Smith guys go about the tent is this a tent that will stay up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9369)|
| 2:36:15| all the time or will it go up and come down as it's needed and it just it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9375)|
| 2:36:21| like kind of a temporary it's not your typical white wedding tent this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| custom-made almost it's it's an ancient fabric but it is a tent like it's taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9386)|
| 2:36:34| up and down but it will blend in with the landscape it's not going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| sharp contrast I mean the idea is that almost like a Bedouin tent I mean this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| thing looks looks natural and like it fits into the setting great question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| though okay so it will like and it'll go up for an event and then you'll take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| back down and then put it back up only when it's rented or required you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| you can have it most of these weddings will be small in nature so that they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| not want to pay for the fee of renting the town but it's there for weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9418)|
| 2:37:04| situations so if yeah so people will be allowed to have an event without any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9424)|
| 2:37:09| enclosure I guess if they wanted at that location yes correct there there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| other facilities where they keep a tent up year-round for example there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9434)|
| 2:37:19| gardens that has a permanent tent commissioner Hill Thank You madam chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9439)|
| 2:37:27| are there any questions regarding the postponement are there any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| that he can't answer mr. Levy can't answer today or their outstanding items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| that will require 30 days if they can be answered today I'd prefer to vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| them but he may be able to answer the question perhaps they could be answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9462)|
| 2:37:49| and put into conditions is that conditions there could be a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9469)|
| 2:37:54| that addresses clarifies that the buffer I'm not sure the we put in thickly plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9474)|
| 2:38:04| it or come up with some better wording you know I think I I think actually the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9484)|
| 2:38:10| city buffer description is better than the county now the the 20-foot buffer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9490)|
| 2:38:16| required under the city zoning ordinance meeting that standard if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| Commission so chooses the I think mr. Levy agreed to dark sky lighting and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9500)|
| 2:38:26| having lighting other than during events is that correct that could be a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| that addresses one of the concerns trying to think the others yeah and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9511)|
| 2:38:40| think that given the length of time that this has been going on everyone knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9520)|
| 2:38:45| something is happening in the neighborhood and we've notified the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| people within to we do to we change our standards it's 200 feet now 300 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9528)|
| 2:38:56| I didn't know if the standard change you come but we did notify property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| within 300 feet our owners of property within 300 feet and that's a lot 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9541)|
| 2:39:08| feet isn't as large as sometimes it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9548)|
| 2:39:14| Mr. Griff I just think it would be a good idea to meet one more time they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9554)|
| 2:39:22| know it's their last go-round you know to push their points and see what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9562)|
| 2:39:29| can agree on and it's been going on so long I don't think 30 days makes any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9569)|
| 2:39:40| difference thank you Mr. Hill your light so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| Commissioner graph and I enjoy disagreeing with one another I say it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| gone on so long it's time to get it over with as long as I mean I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| the folks here that have the questions and and the gentleman here that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| providing the answers and if they nod their heads and say they've answered our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| questions I'm just not sure what 30 days will do if he can satisfy the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| of the concerns here yeah the only thing that I and they'll correct us I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9606)|
| 2:40:15| the one of the only things I heard that I don't see addressed in the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| recommendation is the lighting I think the lady that spoke originally that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9620)|
| 2:40:26| a signed agreement with mr. Boyd was a little bit surprised about the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| parking spaces on her side of the property and she expressed concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| about the lighting levels and I would assume that we could add a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| that the lighting couldn't bleed photometric plan wise submitted with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| permits it's any application huh it's in the application it's not a part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| staff recommendation though it is number it should be or at 30 and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9648)|
| 2:40:55| adhered all parts of the app the event application I don't I can't remember the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| wording I could point out lighting and that it would not go past the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| line or whatever all the plan of operations is submitted and revised by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| the applicant which was on 224 which really does state that down lighting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9670)|
| 2:41:16| the parking lots being put in doesn't say anything about hours of operation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9676)|
| 2:41:23| the lights but yet that would be the point that I would like to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| condition made would be the hours of operation that it would be during events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9686)|
| 2:41:31| only and not on all the time and mr. Levy you you you are good you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9691)|

| 2:41:44| and be it yes and also to preserve the darkness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9704)|

| 2:42:35| I'm shielded and I don't have to deal with the lighting what I had preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| that the parking was further from my property line you bet mm-hmm but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9758)|
