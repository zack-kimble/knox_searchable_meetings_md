| 2:33:21| but they're pretty hard to herd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| I was going to say, do you have to herd them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| Yeah, we got to herd them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| We probably have to, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| I'm kind of wanting to take on the challenge of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| because these are the kind of people that develop and grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| and form much bigger businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| and really support, I think, the wealth of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| not just in what they do and how they do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| but you've got a sort of like entrepreneurial incubator, in a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| and you don't know where these folks are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| But it also is a concept that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9232)|
| 2:33:57| this doesn't have a proven track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| The reason that Mark and I didn't respond to the first two RFPs was this isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9239)|
| 2:34:06| this is, frankly, we'd hope that, hey, this will be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| Someone will come along and put a bunch of capital in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| and develop this project in this part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| That'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| And somebody else can take on the pretty extraordinary risk of doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9257)|
| 2:34:21| because it's not something that's, frankly, bankable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| Tim's project, if he has a bankable tenant, absolutely would be bankable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| What we're taking on is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| To say that this, I'm willing to give this all power and go for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9272)|
| 2:34:41| If it doesn't work, I think that's plenty of time to test the concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9281)|
| 2:34:48| work hard at it, stick with it, face a significant penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| if it doesn't happen before that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| But a decade from now, that's a long time to test a very unproven concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9298)|
| 2:35:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| I'd also like to ask Mr. Biggs to come down and talk about the whole idea of what he just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9307)|
| 2:35:14| about that's what we're doing is testing a concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| if we can help develop this maker community and provide a space for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| Again, it's a city-owned property that we've owned for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9323)|
| 2:35:31| So if you could talk some about the maker community and why something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9331)|
| 2:35:37| I guess, is something that's worth taking a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| I mean, in a way we're taking a risk, but Mr. Dewhurst is taking an even bigger one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| I'm Tim Biggs, Executive Director of Knoxville Entrepreneur Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| and I certainly appreciate being thrown into the middle of the rock and the magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9350)|
| 2:35:56| I won't suggest which one is which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| But for the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| one of our most successful initiatives has been to elevate the maker community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| through the Maker City Project and the Mayor's Maker Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| And in that time we have really seen both the rise of the maker community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| and the work that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| but also a significant brand that I believe has been an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9378)|
| 2:36:26| And certainly as we travel around the country now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| we have a lot of other people who are looking at us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| and the work that we do to support the makers and are trying to emulate that in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9393)|
| 2:36:39| I think David is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| Makers are small-scale entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| These are the very kernels of people who can grow into big businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| Not all of them will, but most of them have really, really limited resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| and a very, very small set of places that they can go to get something like this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9415)|
| 2:37:01| So to put an asset in place that will help cultivate new entrepreneurs in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9421)|
| 2:37:08| new makers, and that will also, frankly, catalyze a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9428)|
| 2:37:16| Spaces like this activate communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| They are a magnet for the creative class who want to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| and interact with other people who are also doing creative things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| So I think you will be helping to birth a new generation of makers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9449)|
| 2:37:36| but I also think you're going to add a lot of energy and vitality to a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9456)|
| 2:37:42| that could really use that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| I also would just say I wasn't even here to talk about this, so it's totally serendipitous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9468)|
| 2:37:53| And any use of that space that involves makers, small-scale manufacturers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| I think would be a really valuable use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| But to help out people who don't have access to that kind of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9484)|
| 2:38:10| and who probably won't be long-term tenants of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| I think would be a really great resolution to a building that when we first toured it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| we weren't sure what could possibly happen with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| Thank you for hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| Thank you, Mr. Vicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| Okay, who's next here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| My questions and concerns are about how is this supporting the maker community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| I'm not sure if Dewhurst will be managing it afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| What other resources are there to help the community besides, it sounds like, inexpensive rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9521)|
| 2:38:50| Sure, whoever knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| It was in your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9533)|
| 2:38:54| Come tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| Yes, we will be managing the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| And I kind of failed to pick up on your second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| So what makes this such an asset for makers specifically other than just inexpensive rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9545)|
| 2:39:13| Well, there's no doubt that that's pretty much the key ingredient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| These folks don't typically need fanciness or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| They need a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| One of the issues that I guess any community faces, and certainly we do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9564)|
| 2:39:30| if you're trying to get started and you need a space to do or create or make whatever you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9570)|
| 2:39:37| it certainly helps to be around other people that have that same mindset that can help collaborate with ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9577)|
| 2:39:43| The hardest thing, it's not necessarily just finding a really inexpensive space to get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9583)|
| 2:39:52| because the availability of that right now, I mean, I would challenge anybody here to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| and find a $250-a-month place where you can kind of plant your stake in the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9596)|
| 2:40:03| and say, you know, this is where I'm going to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| And then from a developer's perspective, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| our most successful tenants that come into this building are going to grow up and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9609)|
| 2:40:16| And then we're going to be back recruiting new folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| that will probably have a pretty high dropout rate for what they do and how they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9619)|
| 2:40:26| Right now, it's pretty tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| I would say that sort of analogous to this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| when retail was first kind of reemerging in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| it was the first folks that showed up that expressed some interest in retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9637)|
| 2:40:42| they all wanted small, inexpensive spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| And there are very, very few small, inexpensive spaces in our downtown, even a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| Most of the buildings on Gay Street are quite large, and it took a long time to get those developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| And obviously that's why you saw Market Square and probably the 100 block of Gay Street come along and develop first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| It was the geography of what those spaces had to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| That's not terribly different than what we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| is actually creating an environment that is scaled correctly, priced correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9668)|
| 2:41:14| and has enough critical mass of those kinds of people together where they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9674)|
| 2:41:21| it's kind of an environment, a creative environment that works together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| And by our support of the Entrepreneur Center and the Mayor's Maker Council and those activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| they'll get a lot of support through those networks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| So they have a place to stay, they're in the midst of a creative environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| and we have made resources available in the community for makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| I was going to ask if KEC would be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| So you're saying 250 for a studio space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| Well, the geometry of the building lays out to where you can fit certain different size spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| I think we have things that range from about 125 square feet up to maybe 300 and some square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9717)|
| 2:42:05| Most of that's dictated by just the way the building laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9725)|
| 2:42:09| But also from just looking out there in the world at other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9729)|
| 2:42:14| this is like the next step out of the coffeehouse when folks get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| We need to keep it small. We want to keep it somewhat flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| And the nice thing about some of these partitions is we hope to be able to have some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| and move those around as some of these folks grow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| So the reason I said the number is because that would be a great deal for some space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| And I want to ensure that it is something that will be very affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| If we're making this just for that reason, I mean that's a big part of the reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9760)|
| 2:42:45| that it will be very affordable and remain that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| Well, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| And certainly part of that's dictated by this building is not a real eyecatcher at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9771)|
| 2:42:59| My partner back here, he's the master of turning a pretty bland, dull property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9779)|
| 2:43:04| into something that's got some eye pop to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| And luckily this building I think has the potential to be oddly just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9787)|
| 2:43:13| It's pretty awful at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| But one of the things we want to do is create this visualness to the exterior that draws people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9796)|
| 2:43:24| But size helps dictate that cost and that budget for those folks that do come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9804)|
| 2:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| Thank you, Councilman Wallerstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| I think it's a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| I wasn't able to extrapolate all that out of the material, so that helps me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| Thank you, Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| I just wanted to point out that, Mr. Dewhurst, there is the project timeline in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| and it shows about a year for construction schedule, design development, permitting, and bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9831)|
| 2:43:57| So I think what you've discussed and what Ms. Foster has discussed is that you have up to three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| but that's not your anticipated because you won't collect rent and have it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9848)|
| 2:44:09| I think this is a great – Mr. Biggs, we don't have anything quite like this in the Knoxville area at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9849)|
| 2:44:16| to serve this need at this scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9856)|
| 2:44:21| Yes, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| I don't want to keep us here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| The short answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| There is a nonprofit maker space in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| The difference is that you can't really set up shop and be making stuff there on a continuous basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9871)|
| 2:44:37| It's more project-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| You go in, you use their shared equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| This is for people who want to be doing a business out of whatever it is that they're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9881)|
| 2:44:46| and who need the space to be able to continue to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| So they could do long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| And I do know makers, other friends of mine that do it in their dining room, a spare bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| have to break it down, put it back up based on things going on in their household, their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9896)|
| 2:45:01| So I think this is a great use, and it's amazing that it took three RFQs to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9901)|
| 2:45:08| So we look forward to seeing this, and it's been a lot of great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| And I will just say, in conversations with the Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| this is some of the stuff they talked about supporting is small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| not just focusing on, say, an Amazon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| but focusing on getting people from small makers to medium makers to bigger companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9922)|
| 2:45:27| that employ other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| And so I think this is a piece of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| My last comment is that I look forward to the ground-break, the ribbon-cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| and I'd like to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9938)|
| 2:45:42| That's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| We forgot. It's been an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| It's been so long that we forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| I do want to say, I've been to maker spaces in different communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9948)|
| 2:45:51| and some of them have some subsidy, but there's also, I remember one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| I can't remember what city, but it was in a former department store with an escalator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9956)|
| 2:46:00| and it was a private owner who says, I'm making money off of this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| because they've really grown the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| It was a bigger city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| And he owns the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| He, you know, rents out the spaces, and it was really a bustling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9970)|
| 2:46:15| I mean, they have a little restaurant-type area and a little bar area, and there was a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| So it was a growing, it was a very vital space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| We're starting, we're just starting to build that here, and this is the first step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| But, you know, who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| This proves, and we don't know, you know, hopefully there will be a future market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| where we don't have to provide the support by making available a building that's below market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9994)|
| 2:46:43| And hopefully Mr. Hill can find another building for his bankable tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10006)|
| 2:46:47| We want your tenant down here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| I like that sound of a bankable tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10009)|
| 2:46:50| We want yours here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10015)|
| 2:46:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| So we have, the ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10025)|
| 2:47:06| 11N is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville congratulating the Knoxville branch of the NAACP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10026)|
| 2:47:12| on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| There was a really nice 100th anniversary celebration, and some folks were honored there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10038)|
| 2:47:24| I see, is that Andre out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| Andre Canty, who is one of the honorees at the 100th anniversary, along with some other folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10046)|
| 2:47:33| And thank you for bringing this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2019-2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10069)|
| 2:47:50| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| So, Mr. York, I'm not good at math, but I had a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10073)|
| 2:48:00| Help me understand the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| How much new expenditures are in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10082)|
| 2:48:07| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| And what you have before you is a proposed budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10089)|
| 2:48:15| The total proposed budget amendment is $7,057,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10095)|
| 2:48:23| A large portion of that is double counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| In some cases it's triple counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| The actual new expenditures are $4.267 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10109)|
| 2:48:35| It comes from $40,000 to come from Knox County and the Township of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10115)|
| 2:48:44| to process all activities related to census activities through the city's books rather than separate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10124)|
| 2:48:53| You also have funding of $375,000 for repairs to the animal shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10133)|
| 2:48:59| That's consistent with a memorandum of understanding we had with Knox County to jointly share the cost of major improvements to that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10139)|
| 2:49:10| You have the big chunk is obviously an additional $2.1 million for affordable rental housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10150)|
| 2:49:23| You've got funding for the MUSE in the amount of $34,360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10163)|
| 2:49:32| $250,000 for Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| $60,000 for Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| You also have $350,000 for improvements to the World's Fair Park, Fountain, and Lakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10179)|
| 2:49:46| That's to do some significant work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| You have some funding related to recode two positions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10191)|
| 2:49:57| One of them is a shift between administration and inspections, and we have to do that accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10197)|
| 2:50:08| That's basically $80,000 and some change offset by about $78,000, so there's only a slightly net gain on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10208)|
| 2:50:21| But you also have an additional $40,000 for an additional zoning inspector to address a recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10221)|
| 2:50:33| You've got city, I'm not sure which council agenda, but the city agreed to enter into an agreement with Knox County for some changes at Blonsdale Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10233)|
| 2:50:50| This is to construct a new school facility in that area, and we had a land swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10250)|
| 2:50:56| As a result of that, the city will incur roughly $500,000 for new amenities to the new space for Blonsdale Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10256)|
| 2:51:07| And you also have some funding related to additional golf course equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10267)|
| 2:51:15| That is equipment used in the ordinary course of golf course, such as maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10275)|
| 2:51:24| These are large tractors and other things of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| And the final piece, and again, council I think just did this earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10287)|
| 2:51:35| authorized the change in the way that proceeds from beer board fines can be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10295)|
| 2:51:42| and I have allocated or appropriated an additional $100,000 should council decide to take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10302)|
| 2:51:49| And so you add all that up together, and it comes to, again, $4.267 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10309)|
| 2:51:55| Hopefully all that talk about numbers just bores you and puts you to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10315)|
| 2:52:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| Mostly it's capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| There's only the difference in the only operating, correct me if this is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10324)|
| 2:52:10| but I believe the only operating is related to the recode staff, which was part of the commitment that we made to you all in passing recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| The rest is addressing capital opportunities or needs mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10337)|
| 2:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10350)|
| 2:52:31| My wife works for the Muse, so I'll have to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10353)|
| 2:52:34| My wife works for the Muse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| The finance director just said there's funding for the Muse, so I'll have to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10357)|
| 2:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| So we have a motion and a second, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10367)|
| 2:52:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10370)|
| 2:52:51| We have eight in favor and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| So the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10377)|
| 2:52:58| I want to thank our finance department for all the work, and David Brace, all the work you all put into figuring this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10378)|
| 2:53:06| It's a lot of things to do, but it's typical mid-year like now to have to address some things that we had not anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10386)|
| 2:53:16| you know, when we all discussed the budget earlier in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| Mayor, just one question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| And so what did that do to the fund balance in terms of Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10401)|
| 2:53:28| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10408)|
| 2:53:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| In terms of just the general fund balance, and there are some other things that are affected as this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10415)|
| 2:53:42| this will be a $3.356 million use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10422)|
| 2:53:48| Now, again, all that assumes that everything that's in the budget comes in as budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10428)|
| 2:53:56| But, again, if that were to occur, this would, again, increase the use of fund balance by $3.356 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10436)|
| 2:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10444)|
| 2:54:05| So it's $4.2 million in new spending of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| $3.356 million, to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10449)|
| 2:54:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10457)|

| 2:55:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10503)|
| 2:55:04| So we have a few people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| To speak in favor of this, we have Mr. Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| This is Wayne Kline, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| It's very late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| Yeah, we haven't been this late in a while, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10517)|
| 2:55:18| We've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| The issue before this body is whether this parcel of land, which is right next to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| where North Shore intersects I-140, it's the last parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10525)|
| 2:55:30| We talked about it two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| It should be zoned from Office, which is 01 right now, to what we've asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10533)|
| 2:55:39| what my client has asked for, which is Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| And I went through the litany last week, and you have a packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| and so I won't waste the whole time telling you everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| but what we did was we resolved, you resolved, to postpone to allow us to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10550)|
| 2:55:56| with some of the residents who may not have met with us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| So we had two meetings before the last City Council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10559)|
| 2:56:05| and then we had one last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| And in that last meeting, we met with the folks that couldn't meet with us the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10567)|
| 2:56:11| I think we have one family still in opposition, and they are here with their lawyer tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10571)|
| 2:56:17| But we have a great plan to turn this into a Neighborhood Commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10577)|
| 2:56:22| with a very small, as compared to an Office, footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10582)|
| 2:56:27| We have a dish where we can build the two buildings that we intend to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10587)|
| 2:56:34| and the design is in your packets, that first of all create a barrier of over 150 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10594)|
| 2:56:42| between the back of our buildings and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10602)|
| 2:56:46| That 150 feet takes into consideration a barrier of non-deciduous evergreens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10606)|
| 2:56:54| that are going to be planted 50 feet, and then the road, Osprey Point Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10614)|
| 2:56:59| and then another non-deciduous group of trees before you get to this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10619)|
| 2:57:04| The essence of it, according to the recode comparison chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10624)|
| 2:57:12| which we're all familiar with by now, is that office development is limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10632)|
| 2:57:18| to a maximum gross floor area of 10,000, but we're keeping this below that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10638)|
| 2:57:24| The facade design standards for Neighborhood Commercial are more restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10644)|
| 2:57:28| and so we're going to put a more restrictive Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10648)|
| 2:57:33| two buildings by themselves, with no parking behind the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| so that we can have a further buffer, with the lighting that will be down-lighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10658)|
| 2:57:46| and low-lumen, because I looked at the recode and I said, well, you have to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10666)|
| 2:57:52| We're going to do it willingly, but when I got into the recode, we have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10672)|
| 2:57:57| So for all these reasons, we're asking for a zoning change, a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10677)|
| 2:58:04| a one-year plan change, and a zoning change from office to Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10684)|
| 2:58:10| and I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| I just don't want to reserve the rest of my time planning to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10698)|
| 2:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| Now we have, to speak against it, is Mr. Dan Moore and then Beverly Milan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| Mr. Moore, please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| I'm Dan Moore, 900 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| I represent Mr. and Mrs. Milam, who live on Osprey Point Lane at 936 Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10712)|
| 2:58:39| And, yes, we passed this meeting two weeks ago to give these folks and other neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10719)|
| 2:58:45| an opportunity to meet with the developer, which we did on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| It was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| Mr. Miller is a nice fellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| It seems like he's earnest about what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| What we did learn is that he has the property under an option agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| He hasn't actually bought it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| And this rezoning request is one of the conditions to his exercise of his option to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10742)|
| 2:59:09| There are other due diligence items that he has not done yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| mainly soil testing on this rocky piece of property that we've been told is going to be dug out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10753)|
| 2:59:19| and have some stores built in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| But until he determines whether he has the ability to do those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| we don't know that he's even going to be the developer of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| It could be that he passes on it, doesn't buy it, because of those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| and we're left with a rezoning that has happened in the dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10776)|
| 2:59:40| in reliance on things that have been told to this body about what's going to happen to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10780)|
| 2:59:46| without any assurances that they're actually going to occur down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| And my clients have had experience with that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| The storage facility on the other side of Osprey Lane, they were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| was going to be a bank once upon a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10798)|
| 3:00:00| And now there's a three-story storage facility sitting on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| that was supposed to have been landscaped, and that never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10803)|
| 3:00:07| So, you know, developers come in and they tell you they're going to do a lot of great things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| but until they are really the owner of the property and have the ability to do those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| we don't have any assurances that what we're told will be done will actually occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10817)|
| 3:00:22| Now, we asked Mr. Miller who the tenants were that he has in mind for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| We aren't allowed to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| We asked what the types of businesses are that are going to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| We weren't told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| So right now, my clients are in the dark about what's really going to happen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| and they've had experience with other developers in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| who have left them with something that was not promised to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10843)|
| 3:00:48| Now, our main concern is the traffic pattern that's going to be around this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| And the Planning Commission staff made its recommendations about this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10853)|
| 3:00:59| and determined it was not suitable to be rezoned or have the sector plan demanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10859)|
| 3:01:05| Their findings were clear that the four criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| to determine whether an amendment ought to occur to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| none of them are present at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| And so commercial activities, one of the things they were trying to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| was commercial activities on this side of North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| and with this project on that side of North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| it's going to increase traffic coming in and out of Osprey Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| which is the primary concern of my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| So we've heard things about the architecture of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| but we really don't know whether those are actually going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10896)|
| 3:01:39| We've heard things about how benign the use of the property will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10899)|
| 3:01:43| but we really don't know whether that's going to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| And so this body is being asked to basically rezone the property in the dark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10907)|
| 3:01:51| to a C1 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| It could be for this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| It could be for some other developer down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| who builds something else that we have no knowledge of at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10918)|
| 3:02:03| So those are the primary concerns that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| We would ask you all to deny this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| because right now you don't really have any assurances of what's going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| and the MPC staff has determined that it's inappropriate to rezone this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10933)|
| 3:02:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10940)|
| 3:02:21| So now we'll hear from Beverly Milan, if I said your name right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10941)|
| 3:02:26| I'm sorry if I mispronounced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10946)|
| 3:02:32| Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| and if you keep an eye on the time, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10954)|
| 3:02:38| My name is Beverly Milan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| My husband and I live at 936 Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| We've been there for 33 years before there was a Pellissippi R| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10963)|
| 3:02:49| and when North Shore was just two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10969)|
| 3:02:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10974)|
| 3:02:55| My children would be thrilled that I couldn't speak that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10975)|
| 3:03:00| I'm not going to go back over all the things you said about the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10980)|
| 3:03:04| but already traffic there is really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10984)|
| 3:03:08| People on our street have difficulty getting out at certain times of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| We just don't try to leave the neighborhood between 7 o'clock in the morning until about 930,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10993)|
| 3:03:19| and then by 1130 it's traffic again getting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| We knew the Pellissippi was going in when we bought there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| and we knew that that would be valuable property and that it would be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11006)|
| 3:03:31| and we have a lot of things that are around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11011)|
| 3:03:34| There's groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11014)|
| 3:03:35| When I looked at the things that it said in the code that could be put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11015)|
| 3:03:43| if it's designed C3, it includes things like gas stations, recycling facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11023)|
| 3:03:51| and one that tried to come in before was a tire store that was going to be recycled tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11031)|
| 3:03:57| and they were going to have trucks going in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| We went before the MPC and they turned that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| and this is going to reverse that now so that if he doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11043)|
| 3:04:07| if his clients who we don't know for any reason don't build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| then that property would be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| Theoretically that tire company could come back in or the recycling station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11054)|
| 3:04:19| I mean, this is not what is good for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11059)|
| 3:04:25| It would be bad for traffic for people that work downtown, Oak Ridge, Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11065)|
| 3:04:29| They all get on the interstate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| It's a very busy area, and trucks moving in and out to supply any kind of retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11071)|
| 3:04:37| whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| But then when I looked at what it said about your code of ordinances for the C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11080)|
| 3:04:46| that last sentence said designed for areas where large commercial operations are undesirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11086)|
| 3:04:53| or where individual proprietary stores are useful and desirable for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11093)|
| 3:05:00| And his attorney misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| I don't know whether he misunderstood what happened when they were meeting with us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| There's not one single resident that is for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11107)|
| 3:05:13| We are totally, absolutely opposed to it, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11113)|
| 3:05:20| I don't know how that misunderstanding was, but we did engage Mr. Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11120)|
| 3:05:26| but the neighborhood is going to help us pay for his expenses because we are all totally opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11126)|
| 3:05:35| And as far as useful, as he told you, we have no clues what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| so we don't know whether we can judge, and I don't know how you would judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| But it seems to me pretty clear that his petition does not meet that standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11143)|
| 3:05:50| plus just the plain human kindness to not back us into any worse traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11150)|
| 3:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11156)|
| 3:05:57| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11157)|
| 3:05:58| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11161)|
| 3:06:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11162)|
| 3:06:03| Before you go sit down, I just am right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11163)|
| 3:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11170)|
| 3:06:11| You're looking around like there's a big old group of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| I want to thank you for coming and speaking with us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| and sitting through what was a pretty lengthy meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| So I appreciate you hanging in here with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| and coming in and telling us what your perspective on this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| So I just want to start off by thanking you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11188)|
| 3:06:33| This council delayed this consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11193)|
| 3:06:37| because when this came before us two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| I don't think there had been enough discussion between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11201)|
| 3:06:47| And so I was glad to hear that everybody got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11207)|
| 3:06:51| and had a conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| I also want to thank you for the letter that you put together for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| and talked to us about some of your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| And so one of the things I noticed in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| and I know this is not related to your request to us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11224)|
| 3:07:10| is about the height of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| You had mentioned that you had this storage center go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11233)|
| 3:07:18| that's three stories tall and that that was, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11238)|
| 3:07:24| you felt like maybe you had been told one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11244)|
| 3:07:28| and then something else showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11248)|
| 3:07:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11249)|
| 3:07:30| Well, it's been quite a while since that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| But the man on the property was our neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11253)|
| 3:07:38| and he told us that his son was, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| had some project, some need for money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| and he asked if we would object that he had someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| that wanted to put a small French bank on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11266)|
| 3:07:50| And, I mean, if it had been our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11270)|
| 3:07:53| we would have wanted to do it too, and we were good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| and so we all said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| And it was kind of like the camel's nose under the tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| We agreed they could put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| But, of course, once it's zoned that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11284)|
| 3:08:08| then they can put anything in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| I mean, the only plants that we had from Mr. Miller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| is a piece of paper with two little green squares on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| So, you know, it could be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| And I've had a couple sleepless nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| since then thinking about the things that could go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| But we had no idea it was going to be that sort of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| And talking about the prep work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| they hammered rock out of that for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11311)|
| 3:08:35| And then when they built it, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| oh, well, yeah, we said we'd landscape it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| but we used all the money to do the site prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| And so we're left looking at that all these years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11321)|
| 3:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| And one of the things we talked about last week too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| when we reviewed this a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| was that this change actually will reduce the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| of the building that would go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| So you're going from what could go in now at 45 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| down to 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| That's if you let them zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| Most...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| The neighborhood is not objecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| to the business on the grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| that there won't be as much traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| If you look at a doctor's office, a lawyer's office, dentist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11358)|
| 3:09:22| none of those people have that much traffic in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| Any of the things that you have listed in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| their very lifeblood is traffic coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| They got to have people moving in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| or they're not making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| And some of these smaller ones like a barbershop, beauty shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| I don't know how much money they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| but it's hard for me to believe if they can put one in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| and people are going to come in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| and drive past all the ones that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11388)|
| 3:09:50| across the street in the already recognized commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11390)|
| 3:09:55| So I find it hard to believe that they can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| the price of the property and the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| to run a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| And the height, they're saying that they would be up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11403)|
| 3:10:08| but that would be whatever he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| If we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| Well, the zone that he's requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| has a maximum height that's less than what you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| So somebody can go in there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| and build a 45-foot tall building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11424)|
| 3:10:27| What he's asking for restricts him to 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| Now, the other thing that it does too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11432)|
| 3:10:34| is that because of the zoning ordinance that was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11434)|
| 3:10:38| this building won't be built until that goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| and there will be more, you mentioned landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| there'll actually be more landscaping or more barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| than otherwise would have been required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11447)|
| 3:10:51| And I'm just telling you this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| because these are things that we talked about last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| and so I wanted to make sure you heard it from me and from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11455)|
| 3:10:59| that those are things that would go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| What he's talking about is 10 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| Ten feet in height is not nearly as critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| as 18 wheelers trying to come across North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11470)|
| 3:11:14| come out on North Shore, make a left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11474)|
| 3:11:16| go up just, I think it's like 500 yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11476)|
| 3:11:20| and try to make a sharp left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| then very few distance, 30 feet, 40 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11482)|
| 3:11:26| I'm sorry, I'm not good at this, very short distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11486)|
| 3:11:30| and try to make another sharp turn in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| This is going to tie up traffic for not just us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11493)|
| 3:11:37| but everybody that goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| You have not, I guess you do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11500)|
| 3:11:42| this is your business, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| But there are so many people that live out in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| work downtown, work in Oak Ridge, work in Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11507)|
| 3:11:50| and they're all going through that little section right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11510)|
| 3:11:54| You try to make an 18-wheeler turn sharp left, sharp left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11514)|
| 3:11:59| they're going to block it, then they're going to get up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| and they're going to block our street totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11521)|
| 3:12:02| while they're trying to turn in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11522)|
| 3:12:04| It's a nightmare to even think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| Well, I'm going to turn to some of the other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| and talk to them about traffic now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11530)|
| 3:12:12| but Ms. Milam, I want to thank you for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| it's not easy to go up there and talk into the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| and face all these folks, all these faces up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| so I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11539)|
| 3:12:20| It's not what I usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11540)|
| 3:12:22| We did it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11542)|
| 3:12:24| And I appreciate your, I understand you're telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| I've been over traffic all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11547)|
| 3:12:28| and I've been sitting here listening and thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| and you must be tired of dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| But it's not just us, although it does seem like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| if you really read that, and it says it's useful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| and desirable for the neighborhood, well, I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| It is not desirable for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11562)|
| 3:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11565)|
| 3:12:46| There is not one soul on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| And I'm sorry that Mr. Kline misunderstood what was said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| at that meeting or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| but they are, every single person on that street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11573)|
| 3:12:57| is totally opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| And I'm not sure who the right person to direct this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| It's either Director Green or Director Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| But, you know, this issue about traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| what can we tell the neighbors about the process going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11592)|
| 3:13:18| with regard to a review of a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| or traffic in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11601)|
| 3:13:27| I'll be brutally honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11607)|
| 3:13:28| There will be none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| The size of the development in the CN or the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11612)|
| 3:13:36| is so small that no traffic impact analysis will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11616)|
| 3:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| So the footprint of this type of zoning, if I'm hearing you right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11621)|
| 3:13:48| is so small that the impact on traffic is negligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11628)|
| 3:13:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11632)|
| 3:13:53| The threshold for doing a traffic impact analysis is 750 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11633)|
| 3:13:59| And a development on this size property with either CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| neighborhood commercial, or the office zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| would not generate that amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| So there will be no traffic analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| Having said that, the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| will look at turning movements and other aspects of the site design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11654)|
| 3:14:21| in reviewing the site plan for any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| that occurs on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11664)|
| 3:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| Director Hagerman, do you want to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| that review that you'll be doing with the site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11669)|
| 3:14:33| Well, I don't have a whole lot to add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| but we'll just make sure that the appropriate size vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| can get in and out for something that that's, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| depending on the business that goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| it's unlikely that you'll see a truck a day, a truck a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11687)|
| 3:14:55| If it's a, I mean, I don't think you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11695)|
| 3:15:00| I don't know if fast food is, it can be put in NC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11700)|
| 3:15:05| but most of the uses that I see in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11705)|
| 3:15:09| aren't going to generate much truck traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11714)|
| 3:15:15| Follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11715)|
| 3:15:16| Sorry to have to take your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| We've, any development that occurs on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| would come under the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| and we'd further refine the uses permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11725)|
| 3:15:28| Drive-thrus, eating and drinking establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| is permitted as a special use, but drive-thrus are not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11732)|
| 3:15:36| The gas station would be, a fueling station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| convenience store would be a use under review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| and the new zoning code makes it clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| if a use is not appropriate for a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| it can be, the use under review application can be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| and staff, just thinking of that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11752)|
| 3:15:55| staff would deny those types of high-traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| use under review application, or recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| I'll look to our planning commissioner, Mr. Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| and put the pressure on him for the next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| in that denial process, but we've really refined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11767)|
| 3:16:13| what the new zoning code uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| and recognize that the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| it's just that, it's a commercial that's near a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| Well, you know, having listened to the height of change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11782)|
| 3:16:26| that's being reduced, the fact that there's more landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11786)|
| 3:16:29| and that there's nearly negligible traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11789)|
| 3:16:32| associated with this, I'm supportive of the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11792)|
| 3:16:36| I do want to thank all the parties for meeting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11796)|
| 3:16:39| and getting together to have that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11802)|
| 3:16:48| Okay, so do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=11810)|
