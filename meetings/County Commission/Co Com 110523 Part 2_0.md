| 0:00:00| So many county employees who make less than $30,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| 3% is just not very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4)|
| 0:00:07| So it's, and last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7)|
| 0:00:12| we asked our employees to start paying more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:15| of their health insurance benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=15)|
| 0:00:18| And in some cases you said it went up 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=18)|
| 0:00:21| So probably they're gonna be just about breaking even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=21)|
| 0:00:25| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| So it's not even really much of a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| You're absolutely right in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| So I don't, I'm committed to finding a raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| for all Knox County general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:39| And I'm gonna work really hard to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| I don't have details yet of how it's gonna happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| but I'm gonna work very diligently on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=46)|
| 0:00:48| and try very hard to convince my colleagues up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| that this is the right thing for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| and for both our employees and for our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| Yeah, you know, it's hard for me to sit up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| as a city employee and do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| that these ladies and gentlemen do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| and not push for a pay increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| because, you know, eight years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| I think the county, and JJ, correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| if I'm wrong on the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| about eight years ago, the county tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| to bring themselves up with what the city was making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| and did that pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| And to go four years, the city, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| you can look at it, 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| you can look at the city police academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| and you could count probably 20% of the police academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| either came from Knox County or transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| came over or left because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| there was no upward movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| There's no out of the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| There's no pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| There's no overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| There's no court time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| I mean, they're not even compensated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| to come to court on their day off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| And so monetarily compensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| So I mean, the benefits package was so different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| We tried to bring those in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| The FOP worked very hard and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| tried to bring those things in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| And, you know, the insurance, the city insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| our insurance increased dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| I went from paying a co-pay to $1,000 deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| But the city also offered incentives to be healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| and offered incentives to do some programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| and put money in the flexible spending account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| to offset that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| And the city started saving money on their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| And so I think there, if we don't come out this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| with, I mean, I'd like to find a two or 3% pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I'd like to find some way to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| without harming the debt, the bond rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| without harming the budget to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| where it creates a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| But if we don't do that, if we don't do that this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| we need to plan because we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| you can't make money by saving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| and we're not in the business of making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| But if we're gonna run on a business-like model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| we need to look like a business-like model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| And so if we can't find it this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| rest assured, employees, all employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| not just law enforcement, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| because JJ was talking, even some of the fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| were giving step increases when nobody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| in the county was getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| The teachers are getting 1.6 on top of a step this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| We're funding TAP money on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| So some teachers are getting six or 7% pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| And we're telling other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| that they can't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| And so I, you can only cut so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| when you hit the bone, it starts to hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| And these, you know, I don't think these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| later in their career are thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| they're gonna make a whole lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| We never leave law enforcement wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Most of us don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| There are a few that make it to the top and leave okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| But when you're talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| the benefits package and the pay that we give them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| I can tell you, if you do a study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| if you look at the Mercer study that the city did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| which is probably public record, I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| you could, I could tell you right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| they're eight or 10% behind what the city's behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| And if we continue to go down that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| your attrition rate, and you're investing about $60,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| for the first year of employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| you're investing about $60,000 a year in a patrolman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| you lose it as soon as they walk out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| So if we don't come out this year with a pay raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| for the general government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| we need to have a vision and a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| to do it over the next two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I've spent off some of what Brad has said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| You know, and Brad, look at next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| and the schools has already told us that next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| they're going to be short $7 million, $7 million next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| I was going to say this later on in budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| but since so many of you men and women are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| I'm going to tell you just where I'm coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| and with what we're having to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Number one, I'd rather take the non-profit money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| and give it to the counties as pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| It's not a lot, but to me, where does it say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| Mr. Law Director, where does it say in our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| that we're supposed to give to non-profits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| And I have served on a lot of non-profit boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| and I still serve on a lot of non-profit boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| That's just giving more work for myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| and other commissioners, but I don't think that's the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| of Knox County is to give money to non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| I'd rather see it go to pay raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| and stuff for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| If we do this, if we do give pay raises to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| which is very well deserved and well overdue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| then we're going to have to lay some people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| And that's, men and women, that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| That's what the schools did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| You know, they made decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| You take the pay raise or you let some teachers go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| They voted to let some teachers go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| That's where we're at this year, you know, with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| So we're going to hear from the mayor a little bit later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| if, you know, depending on how much money that we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| If we're talking 3%, it means $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Well, how many people is that going to lay off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| And you men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| you see these people in the courthouse all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| They're your friends, they're your neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| those people you go to church with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| So, you know, that's what we have to tug with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| And just like Commissioner Andrews said too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| I don't want to dip in that rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| That's why we're in the problem that we're in the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| because we always keep, oh, well, we got that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| we can dip into, we can dip into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| That's the easy way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| So, you know, we've got tough decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| but I appreciate what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| And, J.J., especially your men and women, what you all do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| you keep us safe and you've got my respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Sheriff, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| I'd like to call now on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:44| I'd like to ask Tim Howell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| with the Senior Citizens Home Aid Service to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| He's asked to address us, and then we'll get to Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Well, we'll get the mayor first, and then Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=413)|
| 0:07:03| Hello, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| I am Tim Howell, the CEO of Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| and I live at 6853 Fraker Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| I want to thank you for allowing me to speak with you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| and I came to talk about a capital campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| that Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| that started with a promise from Mike Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| to help us with that campaign to build an assisted living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| that would be affordable to citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| that don't normally have like the $4,000 or $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| that it takes to pay and reside in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| And so I also want to take the time to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| for the support that you have given to the agency for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| Hopefully you received a copy of an e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| and its attachments that I sent to you last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| and if not, I have some copies of those documents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| And I'd like to give you a brief history about our agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| We started in 1970 sending homemakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| into the homes of senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| and we offer a full fee for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| that can afford to pay for the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| and a sliding scale fee that funds come from United Ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| and local governments and fundraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| so that if you can't afford to pay that full fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| then you can pay part of the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| and you can still receive services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| and hopefully not have to rely on Medicaid or Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| to pay for the services that you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| if you become totally broke in your finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| and have to use those government agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| And so one thing about that is that the cost of one-on-one care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| does become very expensive for people if they need a lot of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| and so then they start looking at assisted livings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| and looking at nursing homes to pay for those services that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| And so at that point in about 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| we said that we could build an affordable assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| to help people that could pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| for at least around $2,000, $2,200 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| And one of the first people to step up to help us with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| was Mayor Ragsdale, and he gave us a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| of $3 million on behalf of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| and said that he would help pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| And to this date, we have received $2,443,410 of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| leaving a balance of $556,590.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| And we built our building, and we've got that thing full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| and we're having people pay $2,200 a month for their services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| and that is a really good rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| And we've had to do studies for HUD and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| and these people that are living in our building are under the 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| about half of them are under the 150 percent poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| And so we are meeting our promise to do what we said we would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| and we need the county's help to get the rest of the balance for that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| And certainly I understand that economic times are hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| and I just am here asking to not be forgotten about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| and to give you all an education of the history of what went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| That was a $3 million matching grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| and the state of Tennessee gave us $3 million for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| and we also did $2.6 million in a private campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| And so we matched that the way that we said we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| And at this time, I would just like to ask you to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| to develop a plan to fulfill this promise that was made to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| and to help us get this balance so that we can pay our banknote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| and get this thing, you know, so that we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| with our plans of just serving people and not having to worry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| about how we're going to pay our banknote for this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| So I'm here, and I can answer any questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| I would like to say that this funding has received some national attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| This project has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| I've been to the National Council on Aging and talked to them about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| because I think it's a wonderful plan to help people pay for the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| and not rely on government funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| And so the people that we have there have been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I've also been asked to go speak to the Senate this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| the Special Committee on Aging, and 21 people there from our U.S. Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| to talk to them about this funding and how we made this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| and see if this can be duplicated across our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| So I think this has been a great model for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| and I think it's a great model to use to where you don't have to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| to invest in and provide these services that people need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| and people can have an affordable assisted living to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and not have to rely on the government help to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| And so, again, I'm here just asking you to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| how can our agency not be forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| and make sure that we receive the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| If you would, refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Did you have a contractual agreement with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| when this promise was made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Was it a resolution of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| I remember voting on that particular thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| but I don't remember the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| You said you got a matching grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Okay, so it was a letter of agreement that the previous administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| had given you saying that they committed the $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Yes, and it was actually given to Goodell Coffey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| the former CEO of the agency, and she has since retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| So I started as the CEO in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| Is this something where you would have to have the entire amount now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| or could you have it spread out over a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| No, sir, I don't need the entire amount now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Again, I'm just asking to not be forgotten about this commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| to make the county commissioners about what has been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| That's just the question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Was this a commitment that large?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| I don't think the mayor, according to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| could make that kind of commitment without commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| This was voted on by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| What year was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| We received this in July 6, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| But I remember the discussions about this subsequent to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| because you did get the state matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| It was what, $3 million from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| And they said if the county could come in, then you also got federal funding too, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Yes, sir, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| I would like to say that this is a fabulous facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| The Business and Professional Association meets there once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| And this is a national model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| And they have held up their end of the bargain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| by providing low-cost assisted living facilities for our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| And as we've moved forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| the number of seniors in our community is going to continue to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Within about a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| it's going to at least double in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| And providing affordable assisted living care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| is going to alleviate some of the burden that's on government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| to provide care otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| And we're not funding their operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| This is to help them pay for this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| And I hope that this is something that we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| so that we can fulfill our commitment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| It's very important to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| It's important to our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| And it is a national model that we have gotten some kudos for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| So it would be a real shame if we were to drop the ball at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you. Appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| For anyone from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:12| Mayor, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Tim Burchett, 6401 Ayrtree, County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| And I'm here to answer any questions about the budget you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| And if I don't know the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| I'll go and we'll answer any questions any of you all have about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| You know, we've heard some very compelling arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| on the part of the sheriff's department about the necessity of a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| I don't think there's one person on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| that wouldn't like to give it to them and maybe more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| because particularly with the sheriff's people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| I mean, you just can't pay them enough money for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Or on the sixth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| So I don't know how the vote, when it comes down to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| is going to go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| But looking to the future, you know, at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| we have to address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| And this isn't asking a question about this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| but looking a year down the line, when we're sitting here next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| and, of course, we don't know what the economic situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| is going to be over the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| but I guess really my question is, are we going to have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| to address this rather than just kicking the can down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| And believe me, I'm very sympathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| It's just like Larry Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| who do we fire to give them a pay raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| You know, what school do we not remodel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| I mean, these are all important things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| And it's the same thing about the senior home assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| I mean, do we not give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Exploiting the baby is what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| I mean, this is just difficult decisions we have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| but we do have to address this problem with our officers in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| I mean, I am very sympathetic to the county employees too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| but these guys are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| whether we really want to recognize that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And I do want to recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| But what's the plan down the road for looking at some of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Well, first of all, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I think we have to address where we're at financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and where the economy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| You know, we commissioned the study to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| about where our finances were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| and they said this coming year will be the toughest year that we've stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| And as I've stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| they did not say, you know, I heard some people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| well, that's great news. I mean, it's the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| But that does not mean the following year is not economically going to be worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| We need to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| We've made some real savings in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| but due to the fact that we've had increased expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| on things like fuel and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| you know, the school system, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| they implemented the energy saving plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| and they realized some savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| but in the end product, they didn't realize anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| because the price of fuel and energy was going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| We're talking about a 3% pay raise across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| If we don't raise the emergency fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| if we don't raise taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| then you're talking about laying off 100 people roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| And that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| We're going to have to make some tough decisions in the next year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| I agree with you. I'm not arguing with that point whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| But I think we should do that when we have a firmer grip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| on where the economy is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| And I don't believe we have that right now, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| Well, that was my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| but I noticed a lot of the officers left and they came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| And I applaud you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Rather than just hear your people speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| you came back in and listened to what the mayor had to say too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| And that shows the team effort on your all's behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| I think it's about $3 million to give people a 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| That's about 3.6, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| And the officers, to keep up with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| they need somewhere between 9% to 12% with everything they've missed over all the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| To catch them up would be 9% to 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| But if we just bring it up 3%, you're going to have to lay off 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| And to me, I think we're losing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| Well, in this budget, though, we've made some reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| and I don't think you can identify one service that we've lost, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Health department, what was it, 3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| 3 million cut, yet there's not any lost services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| due to those market-like principles that we've talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| The library, Marita Black did an excellent job of reorganizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| We reopened the libraries up, I believe, 100 or so additional hours a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| and savings of about $40,000 or $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| That doesn't get us to where we need, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| And, too, we're talking, in some instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| we're talking about one-time money for long-term expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| And you know as well as I do, being in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| that that might work the first year, but the next year it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| And, of course, next year we're also looking at the fact of the stimulus money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| or the ARRA money, from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| $7 million we're going to have to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| That's why I fought even taking that when I was in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| because I knew at the state level, I knew Governor Haslam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| inherited that, and I knew that I was going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| And now I realize that I've inherited some of those long-term expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| that were put on with part-time money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| And so we're just going to have to make some tough decisions next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| And I'm very much aware of that, and I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| And no one in this building would like to give pay raises than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| I mean, it would be a great thing if we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| It would be a great thing if we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| I just don't see us doing it right now, especially with this economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| especially with the people out of work, especially with houses being foreclosed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| I've talked to so many people that have talked about their property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| senior citizens on a fixed income, all their other expenditures going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| just like the county employees' insurance is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| And that if we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| A couple hundred, three or four hundred more dollars on their tax bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and that's the difference between them being able to stay in their home or lose their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| So we're going to have to make some tough decisions in the upcoming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| but this year I don't believe is the year to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Well, and Mayor, and just like Commissioner Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| I'm really interested in not just kicking this can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| We need, for the officers and the people that work in the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| and get out here and mow the grass and work at the convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| they need some security knowing what's going to happen in two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| I mean, we need some sort of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| The difference is the amount of services that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| They don't have the schools. We have the schools. We have the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| The jails and the libraries. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| But the difference is, too, that they have it in their charter, I believe is the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| It's in there that they do give a certain raise every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Two and a half. I was thinking two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| It's not in the charter. It's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| But regardless, it's in their rule book, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| So we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| So that's something the Commission wants to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| That's something we could address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| But we're going to have to figure out a way to fund it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| I appreciate you coming down, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| It's a pleasure for the Commission to look at our finances and how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| And I talked with John Troyer about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Again, do you view the findings from that study as we've done good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:59| We've done well to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Or the other end of the pendulum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Because I've heard you quote it twice, and they've been the more negative aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| So I guess I'm trying to get a feel for, overall, what did they say Knox County was in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| I think in my opinion they say that we're sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| I think we have an A-double-plus rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| And, of course, when we go to borrow money, as you well know, and probably the vast majority of the audience knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| just for the record, when we go to borrow money, the bonding agencies, of course, will look at our rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| And the higher our rating is, the less interest we have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| So it behooves us, for lack of a better word, to get our rating as high as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| But I don't think anybody in this room believes that our economy is what it was ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1435)|
| 0:24:06| I think our economy has decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I think Knox County's expenditures have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| I think we've, in some instances, I'm afraid, we've attempted to, if we're not careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| we're going to attempt to balance long-term expenditures with one-time monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| And I just think that's, I think we're in better shape than most counties our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| But I think we could still do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| You can always do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| In terms of what you said about, wasn't that what the study was looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And were we having one-time expenditures to use on operational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| and they came back and said we're doing a good job in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| So I guess we're talking about theoretical things here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Because the county has done a good job over the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| But we have dipped into that so-called rainy day fund, which I prefer to call emergency fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| I guess I'm not seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Looking at the numbers, you know, ten years ago, in 2001, we had a $25 million, $26 million balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:16| The highest fund balance we've ever had was 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| So I guess I'm trying to see where the dip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Now, this year we did the sheriff's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| I can explain that very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| Best practices say we should have about $25 million in reserves due to our debt, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| and our debt load, so $26 million roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| That leaves you $10 million over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| If you just look at this recent hailstorm, for instance, it doesn't come from emergency funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| but say that hailstorm, we had $5 million worth of damages in one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| I think that shows you that that could be depleted literally overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| If we had the tornadoes that went through last night, or was it Joplin, Missouri, last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| the ones that went through Alabama, took a mile-wide path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| I mean, do we have the luxury of waiting on the federal government to come down here after a month or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| That money would be depleted quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| I think we should hold that money in almost sacred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| I agree with you, and I guess my point on it is that's why actuarial people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:35| and financial folks figure out what should be the rainy day fund cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| A mile-wide tornado is about as rainy as we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| It's about as tragic as we're going to get, just like in Joplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| So that's the basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| You better have this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| You're accounting this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| You better have this much in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| The $26 million, though, is just what we should have as a fund balance to offset our debt load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| So that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| $26 million is off the table due to our $600-plus million debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| So that leaves us $10 million that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| and then I made the example of the one-night hailstorm, $5-plus million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| So I'm just saying how quickly that can be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| and I just don't think that that money should be used for pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| That's my whole premise of that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Okay, and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| But I guess as a not-counting, and I'm not pointing the finger at you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| but I take offense at anyone that says we're in dire straits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| that we didn't do a good job, we're Detroit, Michigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| and we're about to start rationing off parts of our county because we can't afford to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| I think we're better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| I think we've done better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| I think our employer base is better than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| and that's allowed us to, compared to other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| thrive in this devastating recession that we've had to suffer through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| And, again, looking at it financially to come through that period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| with the highest fund balance that we've ever had should be commended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| To have a report of external folks come in and look at us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| you guys are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| You can always do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| But you have the highest bond rating ever for not-counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| Can we go one more notch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Yes, we can, and we should strive for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| But I guess these pictures of gloom and doom that we're seeing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| I don't see the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| The numbers don't yield that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| The census doesn't yield that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| You looked at yesterday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| You can talk about it bouncing around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| but yesterday's paper looks to me to be a clear uptick in the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| and that's one aspect of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| So I guess, you know, going forward, that's how I look at this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Not saying we need to spend more, but also saying that we're not impoverished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| We've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| We've hired great staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| and they've managed this budget for the last ten years very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| I want to make a couple of comments just on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| and I want to diverge just slightly from the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| You know, a couple of things, if you look what we have done to make it, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| work over the last eight or nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| is that we took our debt from about $300 million to $600 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| and that's part of the reason that we haven't had to dip into the balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| or raise taxes or do something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| is that we've borrowed, you know, like a drunken sailor, literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| to help cover some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| The other thing is that we're not talking about taking in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| receiving our revenues from the various tax sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| and then trying to increase the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Every penny that we project coming in this year is going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| So are we doing a good job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| I mean, we're spending everything we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| In other words, at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| we don't have a nickel more in our pocket than when we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| The other thing is that there's this implication that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| we're coming out of the recession, everything's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| The statistics that came out, and you can look at this from the U.S. Bureau of Statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| that came out on May the 20th, that was, what, three days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| showed that the unemployment rate increased in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| And if you look at where we were two months ago, it's increased fairly substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| The other fact is we still, in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| have an unemployment rate that's almost a full percentage higher than the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| So locally, yeah, we can say we're doing good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| but we're really not doing as well as the rest of the country is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| is getting rid of some of the unemployment problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| And the third point, and I've tried to say this in the past many, many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| is that we've talked about doing two things to pay for the various propositions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| that people have brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| We've talked about raising taxes, and we've talked about dipping into the fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| or the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| I still say that there's a third pathway that we have not done a very good job on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| and that's growing and having economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| If we look at what we need to do to bring in more money, to have more jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| to have a higher standard of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| to have funds that are coming from other sources for some of these other nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| we're talking about growing our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| And I'm not going to point fingers at everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| but the same people that want to spend all the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| that are really pushing for pay raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| is that every time we have the votes that we're doing something to increasing revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| to increasing jobs, to giving people the opportunity to have a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| and a higher standard of living, we voted it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| And I think we need to take another direction in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| is where we all pull together, where it's the county employees, this county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| the mayor's office, the Chamber of Commerce, everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| is that what we need to do, rather than looking at raising taxes and arguing these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| let's grow, and those things will take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| And I just think we're missing the boat on this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| is what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| The easy way out is to really get together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| what do we need to do to create jobs in this county, to increase the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| to increase our revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| And that's through economic growth, and that's the best way to improve the quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and that's the best way to have the revenues that we need to do all of these things that we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| that, quite frankly, we can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| And we are spending, to reiterate again, we are spending every penny that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| A couple of things that I want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I agree that we need to be looking at our economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| But there are other ways to do it than what's been brought to commission recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| And just because you and I happen to disagree on the way economic development should be handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| doesn't mean that you're right and I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| It means that we need to listen to each other and work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| to work and build consensus on what's best for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| Now, also, we were talking about the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And we do have some debt, just like a family has a mortgage on their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| A lot of our debt has been spent building and expanding 17 different facilities in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:11| So, yeah, we could have less debt and not had a Halls Senior Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:19| or Cedar Bluff Primary School or the Halls Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| or the expansion at the Strange Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| These are all things that we did with debt, going into debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| just like a family goes into debt to buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| So, really, I have to take exception that, and I agree with Sam, that we can always do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:52| But we have been doing pretty darn good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| When you look at unemployment in the state of Tennessee, that's the state of Tennessee as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| Look at what is happening in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| And today, during our luncheon, we were talking about ways that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| is different from the rest of the state and other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| And we talked about many, many factors that have kept Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| from suffering the same economic trauma as the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| So I don't think it's fair to say that unemployment is up for the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| because I think Knox County is not as bad off as the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| So I really prefer that we sit down and we do some more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| We do some more collaborating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| And we do the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| No one is advocating reckless spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| This commission, for the last two years since I've started serving on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| has passed very fiscally conservative budgets, which I have been completely in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| This one will also be fiscally conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| I have no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| So no one is advocating reckless spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| But I think there is a better way than what we're currently looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| And I think if we all sit down and work together on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| we can create something that's a win-win instead of being concerned about a win-lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:39| I've seen this commission accomplish that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| And I think it's one of the things that sets this particular group apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| from other government entities that I've observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| What's on your schedule tomorrow evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| I believe I'll be out in the 8th District, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| And I invite all the deputies to come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| I would like to say, for the record, every time I talk to the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| I don't even like seeing the sheriff in the hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| because that's the first thing he says is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Dog, when are you going to get my people a pay raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| The first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| I mean, he literally wears me out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| When I see him in the hall, I just say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| I know you want a pay raise for your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| He wears me out about it, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| He actually calls you Dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Well, Trammell calls me Dog, and then he says, Come on, Dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| And I say, Well, he does call me Dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Mayor, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Appreciate your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Grant Rosenberg, if you could come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| We've asked you to come to us to talk about community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| This is your area of expertise, is it not, or are we way off base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Because your job title has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| So if this is not your area, then I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| No, I'm prepared to talk about my operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| By the way, Grant Rosenberg, Director of Community Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Knox County Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| Our department, we administer basically all of our federal, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| and local grants that come into Knox County and then go out of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| to our various agencies as they relate to housing, social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| energy efficiency, justice, homeland security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| and then obviously all of our defined service contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| and community grants program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| So I'm here to answer any questions you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| to address some of Commissioner Wright's questions that he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| as far as last year to this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| Last year, we went through a reorganization from last year to this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| in which five employees were shifted from our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| into various other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Office of Neighborhoods was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| There's a community outreach office in the mayor's office now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| One of our employees went over to that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| And then four of our code enforcement officers were shifted under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| And again, what our focus is now, my focus is now in the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| is housing, land use, social services, energy, justice, homeland security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| And then again, all of our grants, contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| And again, I'm working on some issues with our vacant property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| surplus property, and redevelopment initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| Our budget, you know, the majority of our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| only about 40% of our operating budget is funded out of Knox County funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| The rest we draw in administrative functions from our federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| and state grants that we receive from various federal agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| We manage probably a little under $6.5 million total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| And again, only 30% of that is county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| The rest is a lot of our federal programs, as you see me here before you each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| with various contracts for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| But with that said, we don't anticipate any future issues for next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| We do administer stimulus funding, one-time monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| However, when we got federal stimulus dollars in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| we didn't go and hire a bunch of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| We put those monies into projects, bricks and mortar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| and were able to administer those programs with our existing resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| with our existing staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| And again, certainly I take no credit for all the work we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| I've got a really great staff of managers that manage these programs and contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| and got a good team of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| So with that said, I'll answer any questions you all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| whether it's related to community grants, defined service contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| or any of the other programs we administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Grant, for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| 30% or 40% comes from Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| I said both numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| 40% of our operating funding, our total operating costs are about $775,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| Now that's total operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Only about $335,000 of that is county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| So, for example, my salary, only half of my salary comes from Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| The rest I draw from HUD dollars, some federal taxpayers, of which we all are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| But, again, we have several different grant accounts that we draw from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| and each of the accounts have various years associated with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| and it gets a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| But overall, 40% of our operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Now, overall monies, that includes all the capital funding and contract funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| 30% of that money is Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| So, for example, our defined service contracts, our community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| if you lump that together with all of our housing money, our HUD money, our Homeland Security money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| And all those things that you just named right then run up to how many million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| About six, a little under $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| I sort of view what you do like Gloria Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| You get out and you, I don't know, you read the newspaper, you search the websites or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| but that is a part of what you do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| You have to look for grants in order to submit to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| A little bit, and I don't mention about the grants that we actually actively look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| Those dollars don't reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| I mean, a lot of the grants we administer are grants that we just get on a formula basis each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| So, for example, our HUD funding, we're what you'd call an entitlement county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| So we get a certain allocation each year from HUD for different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| Now, I mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| We actually did get cut at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| Everyone got cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| As you imagine, you know, the budget, we were waiting to hear, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| for the budget to pass at the federal level because we get those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| and we count on those dollars to fund salaries in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| So if we were to lose that money, yeah, we'd be laying people off right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| But we did see cuts of 16% and 12% of our two programs that we administer with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| So that equated to a substantial amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| However, with that said, we're a pretty lean department, so we don't overbill our administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| So we try to remain very lean in our staff so we were able to absorb that cut without having to lay off any people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| I guess where I was headed, I know you receive a lot of money that just comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| because that's a part of the trickle down of state dollars, federal dollars, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| But do you actively have people that are looking for grants or grant writers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Well, we try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| We don't have a dedicated grant writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| I mean, Ben Sharble in our office, he serves as a great resource for going after federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| We work very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| We're all about partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| We work very closely with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| We work with our planning commission, our TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| One thing you all will hear about in the near future, you may have already heard about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| is a regional planning grant that was awarded to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| But see, Knox County, we were a consortium partner in that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| So we went after that money, those monies, that's HUD money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and that was $4.3 million awarded to our five-county region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| We do participate in those types of initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| In the past, we will help our nonprofit agencies secure funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| At other sources, we've administered two different TDOT enhancement grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| one of which was on commission agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| It's got deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| We're working on an MOU with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| But we'll help them apply for, we'll act on their behalf, we'll apply on their behalf for funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| and hopefully those get awarded from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| And, again, I don't include those dollars in my overall figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| I just included our annual allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Like we get a justice assistance grant each year from the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| We pass that money along to the sheriff's office and KPD so they can use those funds accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| And then our homeland security program is managed by Rebecca Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| That's around $1 million a year that we receive from the state that we administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| across a 16-county region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| So we do a lot on that level as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| Grant, a couple of years ago, there were some people that were getting community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| We moved them onto kind of like a contractual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and I know that the rescue squad was one of those, some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| What would be the possibility of, instead of giving people grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| that we sit down and we do a contract with organizations that we feel are deserving of Knox County money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| but that we have a defined contract of what the money is going to be used for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| accountability procedures, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| So can you work me through the process that you used when you did people like the rescue squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| and those others that came out from under the, quote, community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| but moved over into another category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Maybe John Tory is the guy to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I hate to talk over Grant, and I think he knows wonderfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| I think that's a great idea, and I think that we have tried to move to more grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| and Grant's office does a, I mean, more contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| and Grant's office does a great job to help administer those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| and I think he's worked hard to put more details and more expectations in those contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| and I think that better serves the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| So I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| And I'll add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Our community service grants really do end up as an MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| and we do have somewhat of a contract with our community grant agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| and they report on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| and you all receive those quarterly reports as far as making sure they're reporting on time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| and they have performance measures and success indicators associated with the community grant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| The defined service contract, the difference between that and a community grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| is that it's a contract for service, so it is a service that is being provided to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| that Knox County would otherwise participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| For example, the rescue squad is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| If we were to try to provide the services that the volunteer rescue squad provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| it would cost us a substantial amount more than what they charge us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| so we contract with them to provide those services to all Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Any other questions for Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| If not, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| That's all we have on the agenda for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| We will adjourn and come back at 6 for zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| and at 6.30 we will have our public forum, public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=2899)|

| 0:54:36| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Mr. Jarrett had asked that we, oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| Sometime in the last week there was a sector plan meeting in South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| Did you attend one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| Is there three or four sentences that could be said about those sector plan meetings that were publicly held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| Was there any, is there anything falling out of those meetings that will make the South's sector plan, is there a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:18| Because I did not see or hear any comments about the sector plan that is being proposed for changes in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:28| I'm not, and based on what I'm not hearing from the staff that works on those plans, I'm not hearing any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| Mike may have something to chime in on, but I'm not hearing of any real big issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| And I'm here to say also I do not hear anything taking place either, although I attended the second one at the tail end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:52| Generally speaking, I think the folks in the South are pretty happy with what we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| One thing that we would like to see is a historic overlay over the John Sevier Marble Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| but I think they discussed that at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| And also possibly, nobody here probably ever heard of Newbridge Springs, which is a sulfur spring there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:15| But that possibly, that one possibly also, because it used to be a big hotel there back in the 30s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| and it is a pretty historic place, old grist mill with a water wheel and used to have a lake and resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| People came from all over the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| What was that second one, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Newbridge Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Newbridge Springs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| The sulfur spring there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| But basically, we're kind of happy out there as long as nobody bothers us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:44| I'll recognize Commissioner Smith in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| Mr. Jarrett had asked me to make mention of the Memorial Day events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3407)|

| 0:57:42| Some people are going to come speak, public forum and just some things that are on their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| So they're going to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| And Don, if you need me to get with the group a little bit afterwards, I'd be happy to sit there and explain a few things with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| But I'd like to say that is where I got my Eagle Scout Troop 55 from Fountain City United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3474)|

| 0:58:07| I know they're anxious to learn as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Don Dare has taken that troop that was a little Cub Scout troop and basically the troop had disbanded for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| And Don Dare here has taken and restarted the group, gone to the Cub Scouts, now to the Boy Scout age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| So congratulations for doing that and reinstating that troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3501)|

| 0:58:33| and she's found us a date for the county softball tournament, June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:43| That's the last Thursday in the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| And a game at 6, a game at 7, and then the championship game at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| So we've got to get in there and defend our title if we want to keep the trophy in the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| So I will send out the challenge to the school board, MPC, and the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:11| And I'll also be talking to Hugh Holt to make sure that he's available to come play for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:19| Where's it going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| I don't remember where she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| We talked about trying to get in the casual park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| I will forward that email to all of you, or the details to all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| but I'm counting on everybody to play that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| So mark your calendars now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| What's the date again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| It's on a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| It's the Thursday after our June commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| Any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Well, can Ivan play with us again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Alumni can play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Oh, and one other thing, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| tonight we're going to have the public forum for people who wanted to come comment on the budget at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| And unfortunately, I don't think we did a really good job publicizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| because a lot of people told me they had not heard about it, but they wanted to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| So I know you've scheduled a workshop for us to work on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| but I would like to request that we schedule another public forum maybe one evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| and get the information out a little bit sooner and a little bit more in depth so that more people can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Since we're in the announcement mode, are we really working toward a 630 meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Continuing with announcements, I believe I said earlier Healthy Kids, Healthy Choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| and the East Tennessee Community Design, whatever that organization is, and Grant Rosenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3651)|
| 1:01:01| there are several people that will be tomorrow evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| This is tomorrow evening at 6 p.m. in Mascot to talk about the little community of Mascot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:13| and how some of the grant money and some of the design center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| and the Healthy Kids, Healthy Choices program as it relates to the rural school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| that's East Knox Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| that will be at 6 p.m. tomorrow evening at the pavilion behind the library in Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| Also this Thursday, the 26th, at 930, the Audit Committee is being called into special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:48| in room 316 of the Haslam Business Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3708)|

| 1:02:07| That's Glocker for all of us who used to go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| I wondered where that building was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| I do recognize the word Glocker because that's where I…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Also on the 26th at 3 in the afternoon, we've been given an invitation to have TIFF training from the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:29| room 201 at number 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| It's a chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| It's three to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Who's planning to attend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| What day is that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| I saw the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3764)|

| 1:02:47| It's Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| I just want to make sure I've got all these things written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| And then we had three or so other meetings that were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| Mayors called meetings on the 13th for the budget and that's…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3787)|

| 1:03:11| And then we're here, hillside, ridgetop and slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| The 9th at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| 9th at the 5th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| Just to be clear, if all our minds are not clear on June the 13th, on budget…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| We can always postpone it until our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3816)|

| 1:03:42| and we can come into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| If we're not ready to vote, we can postpone the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| And then June the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| June the 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3833)|

| 1:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| I just want to make sure that everyone knows that our once a month commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| for county commission is not once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3842)|

| 1:04:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3884)|

| 1:04:57| the mayor will be at the Carter High School cafeteria at 7 o'clock tomorrow evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| I believe that's what he was saying earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| I asked him where he was going to be tomorrow night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| and I think that's what he said, that he would be at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| He will be at Carter in the cafeteria at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| Any other announcements or anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| If not, we're going to adjourn until 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| And if anyone here would like to address us on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3924)|

| 1:05:35| So we'll come back into session at 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| This is a workshop, if you will, a public hearing for any citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| who wanted to ask questions or address us on the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=3944)|

| 1:07:10| to continue to fund my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4030)|

| 1:07:36| I do payroll and inventory for the Recreation Maintenance Office or Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| And I work out of the Administrative Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| And you've been there how long, did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| I had my disability when I came here, and, you know, I've continued to work all those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| because it wasn't my way to sit back and live off the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| What has happened to these services that you provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| Who's doing those now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| I'm doing them up until-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| I mean, who's going to be doing them after July 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| But they told you they were eliminating the positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Yeah, they were not funding my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| The only thing the department give up as far as that goes is three positions that they've funded for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| that are not filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| One more question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| We're probably, if there's lights on, we'll probably be asking you a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| What other jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| You've been there 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Have you done exactly the same things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| I'm trying to get a feel for your skill set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| Yes, you know, one time animal control was we took all their phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| and they'd come into our office and return their calls twice a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| You know, I've done a little bit of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Workman's comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| I do risk management stuff, you know, as far as our personal protective equipment issue in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:26| Been on the safety committee ever since they started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| And it's something I'm very interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| While they've had this going, I know for a fact it saved money in our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| because I've seen the former claims that used to be there all the time are nonexistent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| So has HR, your management staff, worked with you to talk about maybe placing you in another maybe higher need area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4188)|
| 1:10:01| Have you guys had any of those conversations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Doug Battelle came to me this last Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| and asked me if I'd seen anything else posted in the county that I would be interested in that he would help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| And I just said, you know, I've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| I've got a relationship with the maintenance guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| And I'd like to stay in this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| Just for folks' information, I talked with Doug briefly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And to answer your question, Commissioner Brown, I think he plans to, there's a couple more people in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| and I think he's just planning on spreading the duties out amongst them is his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| I've actually talked in depth with Doug Battelle about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| and that is his plan is to divide up Mr. Henry's duties among the other people in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| I'd also like to point out that he's worked for the county for 32 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| and according to Doug Battelle has always had excellent employee evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| And, you know, we've already cut in the last few years, we've already cut over 150 positions from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:17| And this is where I think we are reaching the point of diminishing returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| So I think that, and that's why I asked Francis to compile those statistics for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| so that we can see what positions, you know, a vacant position, let's get rid of it if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:39| But I don't see any reason why half a dozen people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| especially people who have worked for the county for this long and have always done an excellent job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:52| need to lose their jobs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| I just don't think that's a necessary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| So that's something that I'm going to be looking further into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| and expect to hear more from me about this as we move towards June 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:11| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| No, I'm for Mr. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Mr. Henry, thank you so much for addressing us, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Yes, I guess I'd like somebody from the mayor's staff to have a response to this individual's dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:45| I suppose I'd want the mayor to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| As far as the budget, 6401 Airtree, what we've done is we've gone to the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| and said we wanted to remove this amount of money from the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| and this is how the layoffs have come about, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| And, of course, when you specify an amount of money, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| it has a side to it that is evidenced by this man with a disability that's 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:22| I mean, I wonder what your response is to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| I mean, what's this fellow going to do in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| I mean, we've assured him of unemployment, possibly, of a welfare situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| in the same conditions that you described just a little bit ago when you were talking about tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| So I don't see the difference between these two situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| I think virtually they're the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| But maybe you do and maybe you can see something else and explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| No, other than we've told the departments to make these deductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| and we know they're hard choices, but to make the deductions, that's what you have to do is to lay people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:13| And that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| My understanding was that the department was not given a target of X number of dollars to cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| but that they were contacted and said this individual's job is targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| And I think that there's a difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| No, that's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| I'm sorry, but that was my understanding of the conversation that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| And I think that we need to look very carefully at our human resources policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| I think that we are setting the county up for the possibility of some lawsuits over how we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| If the program goes away, the funding for the program, then obviously the person would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| We couldn't create more work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| So which answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| I just gave you the answer, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| Well, that was a different answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Well, you said if the program goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| But if we reduce the amount of funding, then obviously, and they make that decision, then the program goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| So I guess it's chicken or the egg, more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| Well, my understanding of the situation was that an individual's job was targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| Now whether that came...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| You're saying we targeted an individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Yes, that was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| If that comes in the context of you were targeting a program with that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| But, you know, I'm not going to split hairs over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| The bottom line is that I don't think this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we don't put the county at risk by these kinds of practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| I will join in to what Mr. McKenzie and Ms. Rawls have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| And that I did talk to Mr. Bertello on behalf of Mr. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| And he explained it to me, as I recall it, that it was just a reduction in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| And it was unfortunate that if it wasn't Mr. Henry, it would be another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| And I obviously greatly regret it's Mr. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| It was on Mr. Henry's behalf today that I asked Ms. Fogle, the HR lady, what's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| Where does he go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Can he look at the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| And then these other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| But it's the way I understood it from Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| There was no one singled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| It was just a reduction in the program or a reduction in funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| And you had the chips fell as they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| Unfortunately, it was Mr. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| If I could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| We were looking at a certain amount of reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| And his benefit and pay matched that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| When we looked at other reductions, too, like if we went over to our maintenance division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| looked at the last person in there, their pay amount, their benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| we actually would have had to cut one-and-a-half persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| So it would have been a full-timer plus a part-timer, which is another option we certainly discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| Again, the problem there was then we're cutting a crew down from people that actually operate mowers every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| and weed eaters as well as part-timers, which we're really depending on now to maintain the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| So in the administrative office, you know, cutting this position as painful as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| we had other support staff that could absorb the duties of this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| So certainly, you know, like I said, what we would certainly like to do is see if we can find another position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| within the county that we can move this person into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| So just to be clear, so it wasn't a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| I mean, a program to me is like the Bright Star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| That's a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| And I know the young lady who spoke with her who's unfortunately losing her position over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| Program cut, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Well, hopefully she'll get transfer, will, as this gentleman, I'm hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| But you're not decreasing services in your, as it relates to his payroll position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| you're just working the people harder, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| We're able to take that one job and spread it out to about four other administrative people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| So that's, you know, we're trying not to load up any one individual a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| But we think we're able to do that and not really affect services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Where, again, if I go into my maintenance division where I've already cut three positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| if I cut one and a half more, you know, it is a direct impact in the day-to-day maintenance of the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| And we're also afraid if we do that we may be to the point where we have to contract more services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| which then, of course, doesn't save the amount of money that we're trying to save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| I know he's interested in staying with the county parks and rec, but have we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| I'm ultimately hoping to save this gentleman's job in terms of his source of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| So have you talked with other department heads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| You know, we kind of have a process at my place of employment where we'll float out resumes because this engineer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:32| you know, controls guy or girl may be a good fit in another role, totally different job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:39| but using those same skill sets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| What's your communication process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| Do you work with HR to try to find not just this gentleman but these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| As a matter of fact, the mayor's staff meeting last week, we discussed that with Francis Ferguson about the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| you know, these folks that are losing positions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| looking at the vacant positions and seeing if we can get a match to get them moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| So a lot of the department directors were there that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| So I think everybody's thinking about that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| We're seeing if there is a home we can place them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| I just encourage you to, you know, be really deliberate about that because that's, I mean, this is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| all, every time a person's not going to get a check come July or August or whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| that person loses his or her job is very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| I think this one's, you know, kind of exacerbated by the fact that he's been here so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| and he's by all accounts done a great job for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| Next up we have Sharon Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Sharon Murphy, M-U-R-P-H-R-E-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| Address is 1074 Scenic Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, members of the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| I appeared before some of you all last Monday afternoon with regard to the funding for the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:05| and the Beck Cultural Exchange Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| and whether or not the drop within the budget from $225,000 in 2010 to $150,000 in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:25| to a proposed $12,000 in the budget of 2012 was appropriate, wise, made sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:36| or was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| I've been able to do a little bit of research since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| and I appreciate very much your having the opportunity for us to come before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| In looking at the hotel-motel tax funds and how they are generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| and how the city receives them, city and county receives them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| I was able to find, and pardon me because I'm not sure that I can flip through back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| through my notes really quickly, I did not have the opportunity to write up a concise presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| But under the Private Acts of 1982, under the Tennessee Code Annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| I found Section 58, 59 of Chapter 847, Subject 10, and it has a number of ordinance numbers beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:29| And it says that as far as the revenue source of the hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:37| it may help municipalities increase their tourist promotion activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| or supplement general fund revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| And that comes from an advisory from the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Municipal Technical Advisory Services dated November 18, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| What I found in this section was that expanding and distributing tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| Section 2 says, quote, if the county has levied tax at rate in excess of 3% but not exceeding 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:09| it shall cause the tax proceeds in excess of 3% to be held by county trustees for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| one, retirement of bonds issued by county for acquisition, construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| equipping of tourist-related facility within the definition of this article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| and for operation, maintenance of setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| And I would presume at this point that that would include the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:38| as well as those items that were added to the Beck Cultural Center in the recent past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| I don't know for sure that those funds came from that, but it seems to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| And there has been some question as to how Beck got the funds to improve upon its locale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| and upon its facilities and that it was such a wonderful resource for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5035)|
| 1:24:04| with its history of the last 200 plus years dating back to the black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| the African-American community, and all of the other things that are contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| within the Beck Cultural Center that the library system felt was appropriate to add to its system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:25| And that agreement, I understand, to join was not fully completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| And I've been told only that it was not completed by both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| It was not the fault of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center that the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| to totally combine with the library system was not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| Now, the other section of this, Section 3, says the county by proper resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| of its county legislative body is authorized to contract with any municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| within its boundaries with respect to such tourist-related facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| and to use or pledge such tax collections to the payment of such funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| The question arose in my mind as to how much these funds were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| And according to the statements at the budget hearing that I attended, approximately $5.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:26| Well, I went and I looked into the proposed budget, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:34| for Knox County proposed budget 2011-2012, the special revenue funds of the five-year budget summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:43| Adopted in 2009-10 was $5,558,192 from the hotel-motel tax that was generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:55| In 2010-2011, it states $5 million was generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5155)|
| 1:26:04| And proposed in 2011-2012, $5,459,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| I would presume again that 2009-2010 of the $5.5 million plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5171)|
| 1:26:20| and the 2010-2011 $5 million plus are fund figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| The presumption I'm making on this is that the $5.5 million approximately for 2011-2012 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5186)|
| 1:26:35| is an estimate based on economic factors and what has gone down in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| Now, in the, looking at the, at the budget, I looked at the city budget also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:55| And the city budget grants $20,000 to the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| And that is, it lists the Beck Cultural Exchange Center as being a cultural item or location along with the Museum of Appalachia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:17| along with a number of others that celebrate Knoxville's heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| And there is an agreement, I understand, on the, in the city budget, page 63, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| that says, quote, the city and Knox County have an interlocal agreement to support debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| of the general obligation public improvement bonds, series 2002, capital A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| Under the agreement, the county has agreed to pay the city 75% of hotel-motel tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| received from the privilege tax imposed by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| That is in excess of the 3% value being taxed up to a maximum amount of $1,500,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5272)|
| 1:28:02| If you look at year 2010-2011, projected $5 million hotel-motel tax times 3% that the city allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:14| that's $150,000, which leaves approximately $4,850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| If you multiply 75% of that, you actually end up with $1,212,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:30| which is a little bit less than the maximum that's allowed under this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| So say you have the $4,850,000, subtracting the $150,000 3% allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:46| you end up with approximately $3,637,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| You subtract $1,500,000 that goes toward the debt, you end up with $2,137,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5333)|
| 1:29:01| And I'm not swearing on these figures, I am no accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| And I did this on a little calculator that is not necessarily totally accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| But this is an approximation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| This says to me that there is a lot of money available from the hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:25| generated each year in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| A certain portion goes to the city to retire the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| And then there is listed under the proposed county budget items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:43| such as the Tourism Sports Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| that is adopted in the last year's budget, 2010, $2,425,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:57| And for year 2011, $2,387,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| which is the same amount that's proposed in the 2012 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| The Bucks Center, as I said, was dropped from $225,000 in 2010 to $150,000 in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:16| and down to $12,000 for the proposed budget of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Blount Mansion, East Tennessee Civil War Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| which is the Knox County Sesquicentennial Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| Hazen House Historical Museum Foundation, James White Fort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| Marble Springs Governor John Sevier Member Association, Ramsey House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| all are to receive $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| The Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is projected to receive the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| as it has in fiscal year 2010 and 2011, and that is $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| The total amount here, as I calculated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| is that $2,800,500 in 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| was expended under these items in 2011, $2,747,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:18| and projected for fiscal year 2012, $2,621,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:26| Not contracted, the items that are listed under community grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:36| in the budget, page 23, that are not under the hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5496)|

| 1:32:08| Tennessee SAGE Committee...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Ms. Murphy, I hate to cut you off, but we're starting to get a little antsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| Okay, may I just summarize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| Yes, again, we want to be respectful to you, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Two sentences, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Out of the available $2,137,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| where is the rest of the money under the hotel-motel tax fund going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| And why is it that you cannot find the funds for the Buck Cultural Exchange Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| if these funds are supposed to go to such cultural museum, etc.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| The figures are here in the county budget, but they aren't complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| to my understanding and to my ability to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| They should be for any citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| We shouldn't need an accountant to agree to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| So I'm asking, where is the rest of the money going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| And that's what I'd like an answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| and I'd like to support the Buck Cultural Exchange Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| for at least $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| if not the $225,000 we received two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| Before she leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Before she leaves, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Commissioner Briggs, yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| Or Andrews, do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Yeah, Ms. Murphy, I appreciate your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| but we had at about 334 o'clock we had Gloria Ray come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| and Gloria Ray explained roughly $5 million is what she brought in last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| And here would be the breakdown of where that $5 million goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| $2 million goes to Knox County for debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| and that debt service can be on any capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| I think it's the library debt service right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| $500,000 is transferred to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| which they disperse their funds for back in other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| $250,000 goes to Knox County for the tourist-related activities or organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| and $2.25 million is Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| So that's where that $5 million goes, and that's what is in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| So $250,000 goes to the county, you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| Yeah, that's the breakdown of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| $250,000 is the breakdown of all the money that's in the budget handed out to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| there's more there, but there's $250,000 of it from the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Okay, well, I'm not in a position myself at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| to be able to calculate all those figures and figure out where they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| but I suggest that you guys do a little more calculating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| and look at what the Beck Center brings in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| and the fact that according to Avon Rollins, who's the executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| he actually brings in more people than the football games at $100,000 per football game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:43| and to the Basketball Women's Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| So I would suggest that you take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| and see just how much this center does bring to this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| and how much it adds to the hotel-motel tax fund itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| So thank you. I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Thank you. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Yeah, I had – are you just an interested citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| or do you have some relationship with the Beck Cultural Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| I'm an interested citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| I meet with the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| In fact, our next meeting is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I'm co-chair with special agent in charge of the FBI, Richard Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| of the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| And as such, we have met at the Beck Center for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| and I'm very concerned about its future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| because the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| does deal with the issues of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| the minority community, which is closely located around its center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| And these issues have a lot to do with our ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| and the location has a lot to do with our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| to be able to address the problems, the minority problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| And the purpose of the East Tennessee Civil Rights Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| is an informal networking group of community leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| civil rights advocates, area law enforcement agency representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| and concerned citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| It provides a forum for advancing civil rights issues of concern in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| including the prevention and detection of hate crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| Excuse me, may I ask a question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| You probably – I thought maybe you were on their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| and you could answer this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| No, sir, I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| But, you know, there was a letter that was sent on August the 10th, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| by Mayor Ragsdale that said that the county was exercising its right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| of voluntary determination under Section 4.F of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| And I'm just asking for my information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| Do you know what the board's response was to that letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| I have no knowledge of the board's activity or response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| I've never attended a board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I've been there as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| The reason I mention this is simply because the board's had two years' notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| that this day was coming, and I just didn't know what their plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| I'm not sure that that's accurate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| I have no way of knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| If you'll give me your e-mail address, I'll send you the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| because I have it right here on my computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| My e-mail address is T, as in Thomas, HOR1074, at bellsoft.net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:20| And I would be happy to read any information that any of you would wish to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| Should I repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Why don't you send me an e-mail or send an e-mail to the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| and I'll be glad to send you the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| I'd like to address a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| To answer, no, you're fine to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| I don't have any questions directly towards you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| but I will comment that there are some unanswered questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| maybe not directly with what you covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| I've asked questions, I guess, on two occasions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| I won't ask for a third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| But the finance department is doing some research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| and I, too, have questions on how we're spending the hotel-motel tax fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| how we're distributing those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| I'll correct one thing because, again, I know people can take one statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| a sound bite, and drag it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| I don't think Mr. Rollins said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| They're bringing in more than people on a UT Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| I do think we've probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| You'd have to call the fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| The fire inspector would be called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| But I do think as far as ticket sales, people through the gate at Women's Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:43| I think there's probably no comparison there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| and nothing disparaging about the Women's Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| But, yeah, that is a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| But the other one probably is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| Let me just say, Sam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| let me just say that when we were there on Thursday, we asked that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| and he said around $60,000 to $70,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| That was the figure he gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| To kind of, again, discuss, because no one's here representing Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| Beck, as Commissioner Smith, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| someone said today that the newly hired UT basketball coach, Konzo Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| they're hosting a reception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| Someone's hosting a reception for them at Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| So that's what they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| And, you know, we heard a lot from Beck last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| So I think their views are clearly understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| But let me address, from a non-board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| but a person that's been involved with Beck Cultural Exchange Center negotiations with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| since the day I raised my right hand and took an oath of this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| And a simple answer is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| And that's why I keep, you know, trying to sway people away from making general statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:09| It's a house, just like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| It's this, just like, you know, or the other side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| It's a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| It should be part of the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| So both sides, I really wish we wouldn't make those generalized statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| because, you know, if we have an hour or so, we can discuss the history of Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| And I mean the recent history of the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| I mean, people must understand that if a center is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:42| promises made that this is going to be a library center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| therefore, on the same hand, we're going to move another center really out of your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:54| that means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| And at the end of the day, that means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| We're going to make this center a library center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| It means something to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Forget about the boards and the mayor's offices and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| It means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| There is a commitment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| So we're going to allow this to be taken away to bring this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| And, you know, again, not trying to rehash the past, but when we want simple answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:25| Why didn't Beck respond to this two years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| There have been intense negotiations, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| Intense negotiations, back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| So I'm just giving you the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| I'm not pointing the finger, I'm just trying to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| Why didn't they respond to the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| There was a whole bunch before the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| There were draft versions of different MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| There were return to you can have our deed, but we want to make sure this is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| There was a lot that went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| So you can't put a box around it, a bow around it, and say they didn't turn their deed in, so forget about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| It really is a lot more complicated than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| No one wants to hear all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| I'm not going to rehash all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| But there was a lot that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| But I'd like to just go back to the first fruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| We moved the library out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Commissioner Wright, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| About a mile away from the county line, half a mile away from the county line east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| And that's a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| We reused the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| That neighborhood needs a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| But the center city needs Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| And that was the promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| So we're actually doing a pretty good deal based on the promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| Because that promise, we're going to cut the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| We're going to take care of the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| We're going to have PBA clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| All that went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| We're going to pay your utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| We're going to bring a staff of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| That's the original MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Think about what that costs, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| We're going to bring a staff of three, take care of all the utilities for this pretty large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| I don't know what square footage is, large facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| We're going to supply it with computer and automation and keep things running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| We're going to pay staff with fringes for your center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| That was the original agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| That's more than $400,000 if we add all of that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| So things negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| We worked with this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| And the bottom line figure was that $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| So again, I don't want to keep beating the horn, but I do want to try to educate people that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| hey, this $150,000 based on the original promise ain't a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| Pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| No liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| It's your baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| We're going to support it because this is a core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| It is a gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| It is a crucial place in the fabric of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| So again, that's all I'll say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| But hopefully you all can kind of get your arms around what happened in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| I hope this helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| Really, in the broadest sense, I don't find anything that Commissioner McKenzie said that I disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:25| One of the things that I really hate to do whenever we get up in front of some issue is to try to take it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| and compare it to other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| In this particular instance, though, if we're balancing something against something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:42| maybe I shouldn't say it this way, but during the period of time that these changes took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:52| or as mentioned earlier today, significant financial dollars expended at Corrington or Halls or Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6292)|
| 1:45:05| South Knoxville, I just want to make sure that I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| And I've visited all those senior citizen centers, and there's five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Maybe this place could have been the sixth senior citizen center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| Also, during this period of time, a community center in Corrington, which the citizens financed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:28| drug in rural metro to foot some of the bill, the county did take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:35| The county expanded, and it sits there today as one of these five that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| Now, that did take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| I mean, the deed, I assume that all that kind of paperwork was wrestled with and finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| I think during that same period of time, what I'll refer to as the Gibbs Community or Ruatan Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6351)|
| 1:46:01| was owned by the citizens of the Gibbs Community, developed several acres, and it's now recreational fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:13| It is now currently owned by the county because that was wrestled through some kind of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| I can give you one example on the other side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| The Barbara Abernathy House mascot did receive some public dollars during the previous administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| but they are still a standalone today community center, senior citizen center, and they are zero in today's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:41| And they received lots of dollars, maybe none last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| but they received lots of dollars during these same periods of time that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:52| So you see where I come from whenever I say I have trouble of saying these people get and I don't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6412)|
| 1:47:00| I think all these things ought to stand alone on their own merits, and this one has merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:08| It needs to be looked at in that train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| Now, I've really gone long on what I really wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| In the previous presentation, we get lots of questions about money, dollars, where they come from, how many we spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:25| and I'm just now speaking to a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| I believe that the lady was introducing us to the fact that there are certain dollars that go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| Some unknown number of dollars from Knox County or the Hotel Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| But when I look back at something that was handed out to us earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| it has physical years from 2002 to 2010 of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame looking to me like they paid Knox County a low of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6468)|
| 1:48:02| $957 or a high of $6,630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| That's money that's flowing in the opposite direction of what I think I heard just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| And then one last thing, Dr. Briggs, we had quite a discussion of this the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| and this bouncing back and forth of letters about whether or not there was an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| should have been an agreement, should the deed have transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| We went from relatively insignificant dollars to significant dollars, now back to insignificant dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:40| We had quite a discussion of that the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| and I didn't want you to get sucked in on something that we've had a little bit of discussion about or around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:54| This is a thorny issue and I have one more statement to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| but I'm going to make it after this discussion of Beck sort of goes away for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| But please realize that this is going to have to have some kind of vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| and we need to try to work toward what's going to be the best outcome of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| but there are some other parameters that we'll have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| How many meetings have we got coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| At least two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| John, did you want to make a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| You had come to the podium and I didn't want you to leave without that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| Just trying to offer a couple of facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| It's $150,000 for the women's basketball hall of fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| The county has a contract that we're required to fulfill anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| at least while the contract is still there and we do own the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| I just wanted to make one comment is that I wasn't saying or what I meant to say was nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| I'm sort of apologizing that nothing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| I was wondering if the nice lady was on the board and just what their plans were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| because it was informational and not accusatory was all I was trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:12| Next we have Bridget Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| Ms. Turner, if you'd come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| After that we have Mr. John Stewart, and that's all we have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| So unless there's someone else, that will be the end of our public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| But, Ms. Turner, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| Bridget Turner, 109 Gallery Avenue Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| I'm coming in support of the Beck Center and also the Kumbu Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| And just listening to what's been going on in the last week, reading the comments in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| it's kind of been saddening, but we do need to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| One thing that I do agree with that's been said today is that we can't lump all these entities together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| and say it's a senior citizen or a community center or a children's center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:03| because Beck is all those and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| It's our largest, the oldest custodian of African American records in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| The Kumbu Festival is the largest festival in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| And if we were to take a 92% cut in our salaries, we can live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:23| Nobody can live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| So I'm asking that you reconsider the dramatic cut that we've had in Beck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| and also do some funding for the Kumbu Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| Before I get to Mr. Stewart, we had an individual come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| I just had a quick request, and Commissioner Wright made me think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| Maybe it would be research for someone on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| And that's on the Corentin Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| Do we own that facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| I know you said we own the Women's Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| Or is that still owned by the community of Corentin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| We have a couple of meetings between now and then if you could find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| We do not own the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| So we're funding a center that we don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| Is there a memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:25| Hemal Taylor, 8701 Paxton Grove Lane, Director of Senior Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| We do not own, physically own, the Corentin Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| We pay for all operations for senior programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| So we pay the utilities, staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| We pay for the senior center portion of the utilities and staff, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Is there a memorandum of agreement like was offered to Beck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| What kind of instrument do we use to operate that facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| Currently we do not have an MOU with Corentin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| So what do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| Handshake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| I need help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| No, we do not have an MOU is all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| I'd like someone, we've done a whole lot of talk about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| I think Dean brought it up at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| John just brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| I'm reaching for some understanding in how this differs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| Well, with the last administration they had an agreement with the Corentin Community Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| to run all operations for the Corentin Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| We do all operations for the senior programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| They do operations for the community club, but we just do the senior programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| And the last thing I want, do not pull any funding from Corentin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| I'm coming to see folks, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| I'm not where I'm going with this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| But at the same time, it's like Beck's being beat up because they didn't send their deed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6829)|
| 1:53:56| And I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| I mean, you know, I'm trying to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| I can't get my arms around why not or why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:10| Significant funds, close to $100,000 I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| I don't know if utilities were included in that, what, $80-something thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| I don't know if utilities were included in that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| Dean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| In terms of the, I think one key difference would be that the senior centers is a government operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| Like if we had a library that leased a building, we would be obligated to fund that library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| The senior center at Corentin, those senior functions, that's a government function that Knox County has chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| in the past administration to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| And the vehicle to provide the facility is through an agreement to use part of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| But the functions are a government function just like the libraries or the senior centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| and buildings that the county owns, whereas the Beck Center is not a government operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| But it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| I mean, it was, I guess, according to you, until up through 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| The previous mayor, Mike Ragsdale, and the MOU was canceled under his administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| and was executed on, I believe, Commissioner Briggs, did you say it was August 10th, 2010?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| Ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| It was in 2009, but they gave them an extra year of funding through 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| Yeah, but it stopped being a library in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| They stopped being county employees, I think, at the end of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| But the memorandum of understanding, I guess, was supposed to stay in place through then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:41| Can you kind of see my concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| I think the key point is that that memorandum of understanding was terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| and then in 2009 that termination was executed, or in 2010 that termination was executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| And so going forward, there is a fundamental difference between Beck, a library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| or a senior center, recognizing that it does many functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| but it is not a government function at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| I agree with that, not at this time, but the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| I mean, there were lawyers involved with the whole deed aspect as it relates to Beck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| and what happens with that, but this is a handshake agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| There's nothing signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| Which, again, maybe is okay because that's the function that these folks want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| Apparently there were several handshake agreements in the past that are obligating funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:38| Well, okay, I'll have more questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Hey, Mr. Ross, before you leave, do we pay rent at Coryton and do we have an investment in Coryton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| I believe that we do pay for the portion of the facility that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| there's a citizen center and a senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| We pay for the utilities and that portion, which is used by the senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| Do we pay rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| No, if it's rent or HEML.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| Do we make an investment in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| I believe we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| We'll get the breakdowns for that for you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| Mr. Chairman, the lady came and she spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| She said that the Kumba Festival is the largest festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| Is that a correct statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| Just a point of clarification on the largest festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| She said largest festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| You didn't specify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| I want to ask a question about the senior citizens' home aid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| and I don't know if the mayor would want to address this or John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| What was our obligation from the county to them with the matching funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| The gentleman said that we owe or we are obligated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| they're expecting approximately $500,000 from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| and an agreement was entered into back in 2004, I guess it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| Can you shed some light on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| I don't have a copy of it in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| but I think what he is alluding to is a letter from the previous mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| indicating an intent to match fundraising activities from the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| and the county has, over the past number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| over the past administration, been able to include that in the grant portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| but that's all it's ever been is the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| There's been a couple different sources of funds, including some CDBG money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| Most of it primarily was local money, but this was an intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| and there's no contract, and there's no agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| that was voted on by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| So the commission did not vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| That was going to be my question, because when he mentioned that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| I was trying to rack my brain, and I thought we had voted on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| but I wasn't on commission in 2004, so that's why I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| I believe the commission did vote on including it in the CDBG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| but that was a specific vote for CDBG funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| Only that piece of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| And the commission would have voted on community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| but as far as an agreement that we would pay them $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| was that the understanding that there would be $3 million going to these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| So there was an intent by the former mayor to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| and the budget didn't afford for that, and there's no legal obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| We may want to defer to Joseph Chirrut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| but I think when we talk about a legal obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| that that would require the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| Commissioner Wright, do you want to talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Okay, Commissioner Briggs, do you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| I just want to make a general comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| because I think Sam has made some very good points about how some of these things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7185)|
| 1:59:55| And maybe we could go back and look at all of these grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| particularly like the center at Corrington, and there may very well be others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| And I think we need to have some sort of clarification on what really is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| Sometimes these gentleman's agreements are fine until you change administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| and it's the same with this senior assistance home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| You know, we went through part of this with the Solway system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| where you had a mid-level manager made a gentleman's agreement with the company that runs Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7221)|
| 2:00:30| and that has caused a lot of difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| And I think we need to firm these things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| And quite frankly, I think Sam makes a good point on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| And I would encourage us to go back, not that I agree or disagree with anything that's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| but I think we need to go back and really firm these things up as to what we're obligated to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| and what our relationship is with some of these facilities that the county doesn't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| And I thought it was a great idea, too, about putting them all under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| and say, you know, there's exactly what we expect and be very detailed about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| Jim, you mentioned CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Was CDBG allocated to senior citizens and then it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| Right up next year, or do you recall what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| I think there were two pieces of one-time money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| And so that's, okay, then the county was able to direct some of its CDBG allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:28| to the Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service, but that, you know, there was only so much available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| So it wasn't, as you recall, that wasn't Knox County taxpayer, directly taxpayer money for that allocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| It was Knox County's portion or share of the CDBG money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| This is a subject change for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| Normally, whenever I come to school board, I sit somewhere back over here like we're photo dance sitting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7314)|
| 2:02:05| But I found from the two school administration people, there is a better place to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7325)|
| 2:02:15| Mr. Oaks and Mr. Thomas are sitting next to the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7335)|
| 2:02:23| And if I were them, I guess I'd be like the scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| I'd be getting in line and I'd be leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| I would like to offer, though, if anyone has a question of the school budget, that we approach that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| And if there be no question of the school board budget, we could dismiss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| They can say that they had their attendance checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| Could I ask something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| We've talked a lot about the $7 million from the Recovery Act funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:56| I know that the other entities in the county, and this may be a question for, I guess, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7376)|
| 2:03:04| I don't know who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| I'll ask the question and the one who wants to answer can stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| Are those funds operating expenses or half of them operating expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:17| Because I received a picture being painted that we're going to be on the hook for $7 million next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7397)|
| 2:03:29| as an unfunded mandate given by this two-year Recovery Act funds, two years of Recovery Act funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:38| If you can answer that in general or, you know, this much went to capital and that created jobs or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| So I'd like to get that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:53| Mr. Bob Thomas, 5325 Beverly Oaks Drive, Assistant Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7433)|
| 2:04:00| What you're referring to, I believe, is the education jobs bill money that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| That's $7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| I think it was about $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| And we used some of that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| It's about $7 million of it left that's budgeted for this current or for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| And primarily what that money was to go for was to save jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| So it is in the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| I think a little bit of it has been set aside for equipment, but by and large, it's for salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| So were these existing slots or did you create new programs that you funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7468)|
| 2:04:35| Some new programs in terms of some of this money has gone for instructional coaches that Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| and the board feel like it's a good use of the money to try to actually allow folks to help our good personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:49| good teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| We've got many good teachers, but ones that are exceptional in the field to try to help other teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| with their staff development and the teaching strategies and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| So did we hire people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| These were positions that were funded, current employees that were funded to in some additional jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| In additional dollars and enhancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| And the money goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| Of course, those, you know, the people would go back to jobs that they currently held before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| So in terms of budget impact, you're not going to, I mean, I'd hate to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| I know you're early in the game probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| Not done with this past year's budget proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| But you guys thought about this, I'm assuming, because everyone knew these were temporary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| And what I think I hear you saying is there shouldn't be a huge, maybe I'll say it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| shouldn't be a huge budget impact, operational budget impact next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:54| It's not going to be a $7 million number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| Well, I think it's a little bit early to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| But I think it's going to be a very difficult year for us coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| And those are some dollars that are going to have to be made up some way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| I know we're going to begin looking at this early in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| I think Dr. McIntyre sort of made that point that we will start, you know, soon after school starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| I guess, looking at next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| So I think there will be some budgetary impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| You know, what we've tried to do this year is make reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| As the mayor pointed out, there have been some efficiencies with utilities and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| But with the costs going up, we've probably not realized a whole lot in the way of savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| But it will be a significant impact to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| But we're planning for that as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| You did not staff up with these $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| Next we have John Stewart, who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7609)|
| 2:07:03| Mr. Stewart, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| 6611 Ridge Rock Lane, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| And, Mr. Chairman and Commission, thank you very much for giving us all the opportunity to come and express our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| I'm representing, it wouldn't be immediately obvious, I grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| but I'm representing the League of Women Voters of Knoxville, Knox County, in support of the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7644)|
| 2:07:34| As it turned out, we were having our annual meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| At the Beck Center, and when all of this budget issue broke into public view in the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7661)|
| 2:07:50| And so a good portion of our business meeting last week was devoted to discussing the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7670)|
| 2:07:58| and its funding challenges that were represented in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| And so what I'm saying is the League has not conducted its usual thorough study of this whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:10| because it only happened last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| If this gets dragged out, we may end up and do one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| But there was a full discussion and many people expressed their views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7697)|
| 2:08:23| and I thought it would be useful to come and pass those on for whatever use you may make of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7703)|
| 2:08:31| I think the overriding point that we all agreed on was the importance of the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:40| in terms of preserving the African American heritage in Knoxville and Knox County and East Tennessee generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7720)|
| 2:08:49| And you can't put a price on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| It's a vital part of our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| And we are blessed as a community to have the Beck Center there to preserve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| not in some helter-skelter way, but in a very professional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| They've gone to the Smithsonian Institution, worked with them in terms of the preservation of their historical records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7747)|
| 2:09:17| the letters, the photographs, all kinds of artifacts that reflect the unique story of the African American community here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7757)|
| 2:09:32| And because they've gone about it in such a professional way, the Beck Center is head and shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| one of the outstanding stellar civil rights museums and centers in the southeast, if not the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7780)|
| 2:09:51| In Lexington, they came to the Beck Center when they were going to set up a similar center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| Roanoke, Virginia came to the Beck Center to get their help in setting up a center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| Chattanooga did the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| The Center in Birmingham came to the Beck Center to get their assistance and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:12| So I am not an expert on the hotel-motel tax and the various attractions of the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:23| I'm not here to compare the Beck Center to any of the other institutions of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:30| most of which do a terrific job on very limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7830)|
| 2:10:35| But I am here to say, as forcefully as I can, that this is a priceless asset of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| It is something that we all should be extremely proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| And we should be very, very careful not to damage it in ways that it loses its unique capacity to maintain this vital historical record of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7847)|
| 2:10:58| And I don't envy you your job. This is a tough year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| There are no easy answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| It's going to be a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| But I know you are all concerned about this issue and are looking for ways to come up with a positive solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7867)|
| 2:11:15| And I encourage you to work hard at it, because something like the Beck Center does not happen by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:25| Hundreds of African-American families have willed their records and wills and books and letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7885)|
| 2:11:35| and the Beck Center is the trustee of those records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| They have an obligation, a moral obligation at the very least, to maintain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7899)|
| 2:11:45| I think I've made my point. It's a priceless asset. We must preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| I don't envy you your job, but I encourage you to really look for some creative solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| that we can keep the Beck Center as the shining jewel that it is, and one of the real assets of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7915)|
| 2:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| Next we have Nkeke Adjanaku.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| You know, two and a half hours last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7930)|
| 2:12:22| And if you could give us your address for the record, please, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| Nkeke Adjanaku, 2725 Wimpole Avenue, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7945)|
| 2:12:34| So when I came in, we were talking about the Coomba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| And if no one's familiar with the event, please feel free to ask me questions now, after, at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| I'll be glad to bring you up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| So we were considered the largest African-American cultural and music festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| by the National Endowment of the Arts, not only for East Tennessee, but for the Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| We shared that honor with the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| but I was informed by the Executive Director of the National Black Arts Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| that that title goes to us here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| I also want to point out right quick that when I was looking at the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| I know you guys have been budget inundated today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| but I took a thought and looked at the count of groups that were being funded out of hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:36| but also in the community grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| Out of 50 groups, two of the groups that got funded out of community grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| were African-American and one Hispanic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| Out of the hotel-motel tax and contractual funding, no, out of contractual funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:53| 28 groups, out of 29 groups, one group was African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| Out of hotel-motel tax, nine groups were funded and one group was African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:05| I just wanted to give you that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| Then also I wanted to say that early on I was listening to sports and tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| I was looking at TV before I got down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| and they mentioned the Haley statue in conjunction with Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| Although Beck has partnered with us in relationship to Haley Heritage Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| African-American Appalachian Arts developed that project, contracted the artist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| found her, brought her here, and now when you, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| if you Google Tina Allen, which was the artist for the Haley statue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| you'll see just the national and international praise that Knoxville gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8079)|
| 2:14:46| as it relates to the 13-foot statue of Haley Heritage Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| So I'm saying that even with the Haley Heritage Square, Cumbria Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| our goal has always been to approach our community to do some type of economic stimulus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| In our research, when we were researching and trying to develop and developing the festival and the square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| we took a lot of time in developing figures and getting stats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| on how we could economically impact our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| and that's the African-American community in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| I think that when I look, for instance, at the community grant funding list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| and the contractual funding and also the hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:26| I see so many areas that the European-American community is represented with your culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:35| The opera got funded, symphony got funded, and I love all those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:40| My mother was a classical pianist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| But I'm saying this, that when you cut at the African-American community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| and what we bring culturalized in our creativity to not only impact our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| it's not something that we just want to party at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| It's a lot more thought in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| It's to expose children and the community to who you are and what you can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| the potential of what you can be as a human being here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| So I'm saying that I think that other ethnic groups or the primary ethnic groups in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| they're well represented for your culture, your music, your entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| It's slung down in the city and all those things that generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| if we tell the truth about it, African-Americans don't come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| So I'm saying that for years prior to us creating ourselves as African-American Appalachian Arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| it was such a big void of our young people in our community seeing themselves represented here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:37| Take the Kuumba Festival away. Stop supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| And you have created a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| Sometimes when I'm hearing all the talk about these issues, it's almost like an insinuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:48| Somebody's done something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| If Beck has done something wrong or Kuumba Festival has done something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| But that's not true. It's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| We really need the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| We have a right to the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| I do question the Hotel Motel tax monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| I was there in the early 90s, like 92, 93, when those funds were set up as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| and everybody could approach that commission and be judged based on what you're bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:17| in relation to economic development and tourists in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| I would like to know that, and we were referred to as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| what else can you use the tourism money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| Some festivals, you know, they say they bring 1,000 people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| That's kind of insulting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| Why don't we know the numbers of tourists that anybody brings into Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| And why don't we actually have the real dollars so that it represents the economic impact of tourism in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:49| I think that's something that we need to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| We can't take that for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| Just like anyone else's question about the monies that you utilize from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| I think we've been good stewards of Knox County's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| that we have a visible representation in relation to Haley Heritage Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| that every year, and we do magic out of the magic hats to bring that festival up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| That's a good representation of Knox County, whether people appreciate it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| I do know the children in Lonsdale, Mechanicsville, and East Knoxville, all the way from Alcoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| they appreciate that festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| They express to me on a daily basis that that's all that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| If I hear people in our community say one more time, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| that they're going to do what they're going to do about it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:41| so I'm saying that's why people don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| They have no confidence that we'll be supported for things that are important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| It's our growth and development as human beings in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| So I would like to take into consideration the places in the budget that we have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| We're going to have a festival this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| We're going to do the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| We've done that for the last 22 years, but I've always appreciated Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| You've been good to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| I don't want you to have any kind of way to say that we have not appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| We'll continue to appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| We are an asset for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| and I would like for you guys to consider us an asset, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| Again, any questions, any kind of way that you would like to look at whatever, our books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| any kind of questions you think you may have in your head that we do not deserve this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| please, please, I ask you to come and ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| But not all of this don't do it for me because I'm not talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| We will make a very bad mistake on not funding these two institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| It's not like it's 20 or 30 of us as African Americans asking for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| It's no more than about three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| You can count them on one hand out of something like, what, 75 groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| Mayor, will you come to the podium just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| Sam, we've got to keep that some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| We've got to do something with the back center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| I mean, that's part of Knoxville's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| Mayor, you weren't here last week whenever we talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| I don't think you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| I understand what the people are saying, and it's no secret I love history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| and any way we can preserve what history that we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| They seem to, on one hand, Mayor, act like, you know, if we don't get this, we're going to drown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| We're going to go out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| My suggestion, and I want you to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| and I don't think I've had a chance to mention this to you or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| but I'd like to see them go in with the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| I mean, they do their archival stuff that they have over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| and still keep back where it is, take them over as employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| Knox County employees or whatever, but I just think that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| nobody does anything better than the East Tennessee Historical Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| with what they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| They can buy in bulk and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| That's just something for you guys to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| If, you know, these are bad budget times and if they're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| if they feel like they're sinking under, would they be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| would they be receptive to coming under the East Tennessee Historical Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| or do they want to go out of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| I'm just throwing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| I didn't know if you had any comments on that, Tim, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| No, sir, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Are we through all the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| I really need to say something that's, this is from Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| The school board guys, I tried to get rid of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| and they've hung right in there, so I'll have to remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| the next time I go to school board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| I hang right in there with them till the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| Today, we've thrashed budgets from top to bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| We've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| There are four different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| Every time we've turned around, we've got into a budget slant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| on the conversation of the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| The one thing that I've not heard today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| and this goes back to the school guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| I've commented to the superintendent of schools that he knows the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| and whenever I say that, I'm really saying he knows the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| Everyone knows what the cash flow is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| We have these conservative estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| We have these middle-of-the-road estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| We have estimates that could be this, that, or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| but the easiest test that you can ever take in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| is the test where you know the answer before you write the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| I haven't heard anything today that has changed the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| We know how many dollars we have to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| You cannot increase the number of dollars that will be spent in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:57| If anyone is going to disagree with me on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| I just look at it as a pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| It has some of this, it has some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| but we know what the cash flow is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| We know what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| The mayor has given us a budget that's going to reduce the debt maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| That's a thing that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| It's going to be a budget at the end of the day that has in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| the number of dollars that we project will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| You can't add three more million dollars to what the projection is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| unless we're going to stretch whatever it is that we projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| The dollars at the end of the day are the same dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| that we had to begin with this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| All we have available to us is where we want to re-angle the slices of the pie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8624)|
| 2:23:54| or do we want to add...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| I don't think we've talked about anything today that's going to add more slices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| We've just talked about whether an employee is going to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:08| We've talked about only those things which are going to consume more dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8648)|
| 2:24:16| I've even said that about Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| If we're going to do something there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| it would increase the number of dollars we spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| At the end of today, I've not heard anyone explain to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| that we're going to have more dollars to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| So we can only back up on those dollars that we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| and slice the pie in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| At least that's the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| And the next time commission gets together to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| that's why I wanted to say what I felt here the last thing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| is because at the beginning of the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| someone's going to have to tell us that we have more dollars we can spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| because we've taken in more dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| Or we're still at the same size pie that we've had all day today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| and we're going to divide it up in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| And thank you, fellow commissioners, for listening to me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8708)|
| 2:25:09| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8710)|
| 2:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part2?start=8717)|
