| 0:01:45| and we are appreciative that they are here. Thank you for joining us. As we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| have reviewed during the last several meetings, our mission statement is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities that empower all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| students to realize their full potential. So just wanted to remind everyone of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| our mission statements. Also, as we noted during last week's work session, the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=125)|
| 0:02:13| has, I'm not sure if we knew this exactly during the last session, but anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| the CDC has changed the guidelines moving away from the 14-day quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| period and my hope is that this will allow us to better meet the needs of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| students and continue to make opportunities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| part of our overall mission accessible to our students. And tonight Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| Health Department Director Dr. Martha Buchanan is here with us this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=160)|

| 0:02:50| recognition. So we appreciate her taking the time to be here this evening. When we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| look at, if you look at the agenda board members, you have received an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| notice about a change to the term dates on the agreement with the DBQ project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| being considered as item AC3. Both the caption and attached documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| have been updated and that was the only change that we had to our agenda. Do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| have other changes to this agenda? Requested changes? Mr. Watson? Yes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=196)|

| 0:06:29| partner for Kelly Academy and plays a key role in that school's mission of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| providing an alternative path for students who are struggling academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| In announcing this award, the foundation praised Miss Southern for tailoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=397)|

| 0:08:49| I hope I'm doing this correctly. I don't know. I have heard from several members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| of our community that we're a little disappointed that these rules weren't in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| place prior to when the testing began. I also agree. I don't feel like it was fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| for teachers or the students. And just going forward, maybe that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| that we can look into doing in a more timely manner. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=547)|

| 0:09:17| November 6th. And I don't know exactly what our dates were for our November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| meetings. But looking back, we should have done first and second reading in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| November. And we didn't do that. And so we should have. That's what my view of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| it. And so that just, I think that we just, we just didn't do that. We should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| have. So I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments? Okay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=580)|

| 0:14:06| Watson. Mr. McMillan? Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| Excuse me. It says that it could go up to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=851)|
| 0:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. McMillan, if you actually know, I mean, the way these have been set up, Mr. McMillan, is that once the board approves it with this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=876)|
| 0:14:48| at a certain amount, then it can be renewed each year by the administration unless the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=888)|
| 0:14:58| makes a decision that says that it has to come back and renew it, which has been done on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Well, does it present a problem for it to come back and renew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| With this new technology changing, I'm sure that they will be up to date, but there's no really good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=909)|
| 0:15:21| I would like to see it just come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| I can tell you that legally this has been vetted through our procurement department as an excellent contract for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=923)|
| 0:15:34| However, if you're concerned about finances, the board will certainly review it each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=934)|
| 0:15:43| Well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| You're convinced that it's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| I just know that things are changing, and it's rapidly doing things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| It's a bunch of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| It wouldn't hurt to put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Well, I mean, just so I'm clear, I mean, legally there's no issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| But if your concern is finances, I mean, that's not my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| I mean, that's Ron McPherson's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| Ron, did you want to say something about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| One thing we are expecting is when these went out to bid, it came back actually 175.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| We expect it's going to end up about $175,000 less per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| So in that five and a half year time frame, if that's what we elect to do, it's upwards of we anticipate of a cumulative of a million dollar savings by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| If we wanted to bring it back, and I would have to yield to Mr. Duper on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| if we decided to go into another direction, it would have to be re-bid again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| I mean, if the board chose to, if this needed to be, I guess, approved in the event it were not approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1017)|
| 0:17:08| then we would be in a little bit of a bind in trying to get all the printers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| We'd have to re-bid, but I'll yield to Gary on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Well, what would happen is, I mean, whether, so this will be good for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| or a year and six months, however, let me see, January to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Yes, it's annually for a year, six months, because of that initial six months delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| Yeah, so you're getting your first part, and I mean, that wouldn't be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| If either the administration or the board at some point in the five years says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| hey, we don't want to continue this, they can do that, but then at that point, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| I mean, the contract would have to be re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| I think you've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| If it'll save that much money, and you all are comfortable with it, then I feel much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Yes, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Mr. McPherson, you've already gotten this answer to me, but just for the public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| how many devices is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| The 189 devices to replace on a one-to-one basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Which is a little more than $6,000 per device?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| But these are not what you would have on your desk at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1114)|

| 0:19:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| We have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1184)|

| 0:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| And now, I said that Dr. Buchanan was going to go after our recognitions and promptly forgot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1190)|
| 0:20:01| until we were halfway through approving these agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| So, Dr. Buchanan, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Completely slipped my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| So, if you would, go ahead and come on, and then this will be at the beginning of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| regular agenda items, and then we'll move into our legislative priorities after we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| So, thank you very much for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| And I know, probably, we have a lot of questions among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| I'm sure that probably one of the most pressing is regarding the information that you announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| protocols and that kind of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And I know, since we've met, the days for protocol, or the quarantining, has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| So, if you'll just kind of bring us up to speed, and then if you would take some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you for the opportunity to speak and come before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| And thank you for what you do to keep our kids in school and educate our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| Just first, just some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Today, we had 337 new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Yesterday, we had the most new cases we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| We had over 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| It was about 450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| We're averaging about 300 new cases a day now, maybe a little bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| So, COVID has really taken off since the last time I was before you, and our new cases have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| really gone up, partially a result of, we believe, Thanksgiving holidays and folks gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| and not wearing their masks and doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Currently, we have 140 Knox County citizens in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| That's the most we've had for Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| And we're up to 195 deaths at this point of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| That's not a regional number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Those are Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| We are averaging about 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Sorry, we have 63 cases per 100,000 population, and that is our 14-day average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| That's very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| When you think about the Board of Health, their marker for escalating is 10 cases per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| 100,000, so we're quite a bit higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| And our percent positivity is over 20%, so 22.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| And that's quite a bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Again, 10% is the cutoff for doing other things for the Board of Health, so we're quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| bit above that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| And so, yeah, now I'll get to the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| The CDC recommended some changes in a couple of different areas, and Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| of Health has decided to adopt those, and we also are adopting those here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| So first, the change is prioritizing contact tracing and case investigations, so prioritizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| those that are most likely to have the most impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| So we will be doing contact tracing and case investigations on all of the cases that get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| reported to us within six days of their testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So if they come to us after six days, we won't investigate them, we won't reach out to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| folks, partly because they're kind of at the end of their isolation period and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| less that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| And we've said this many times, at this level of community transmission, contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| is less effective than it is earlier on in an outbreak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| The exception to that rule will be people over the age of 60, because of the risk for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| complications and death, and people under 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| We really feel like helping control cases in the schools and in our families is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| and also other congregate settings like long-term care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| So there are some exceptions, but we'll be doing less, so some people won't be called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| by us at all, but they're COVID cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| So it's really important, if you think you have COVID, you need to follow the isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| guidelines, and we've got some calculators for people who need to know how long to quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| and stuff on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| So that's one of the changes, and that just helps us focus on higher-risk folks and places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| where transmission can occur in congregate-type settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Then the other change is a change in quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Again, that came from the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| 14 days is still the ideal time to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Your risk of becoming a case of COVID-19 after that is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| If you do not have symptoms, you can quarantine for just 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Your risk of developing symptoms and becoming a case of COVID at that point is about 1%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| so a little more risky for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And then if you have no symptoms and you have a test within two days of the seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1477)|
| 0:24:45| either a PCR or an antigen test that's negative, you can then come out of quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| There's about a 12% chance that you will go on to become a case of COVID, so you still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| need to monitor yourself and kind of take it easy and not go to a big party or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| We're kind of discouraging that activity anyway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| So those are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| The thought being that backing off on quarantine and allowing some people some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| will do a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| One, we hope it will improve compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| It's hard to quarantine for 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| It's hard to quarantine for 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| It's disruptive, and we know that, and the CDC is hoping that we'll have better compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| It also helps people get back to work or back to school sooner, so that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| People need to be on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| They need to be earning a paycheck, putting food on the table, and kids need to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| We're hoping those two things will be positive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Those are kind of my updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I'm happy to take any questions from you about anything you might have questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I just want a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| When you're talking about the contact tracing of 60-year-olds, is it like if I have COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| but I've been around someone that's 60 or older, you'll contact them, or is it the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| that I'm over 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| I'm a little confused about the contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| It's really the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| If the case is over 60, we're going to do a case investigation, which also includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Within the contact tracing, we will also be prioritizing groups at higher risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| If somebody in that 60-year-old's life works at a long-term care, we're going to notify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| If the 60-year-old has a buddy he plays cards with who's 40, we might not notify the 40-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| We'll ask him to notify the 40-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| It's just kind of a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| When I say younger than 18 or older than 60, those are the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Thanks for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Could you just repeat the 7-day and 2-day testing aspect again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| If you're asymptomatic and you have a negative test that was obtained either on day 5 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| 6 before day 7, you can come out of quarantine on day 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Again, we've got calculators on our website that are going to help people figure this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| I've said it a bunch of times and I still sometimes get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Before we go to Ms. Bounds, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| I'm just wondering, the antigen test, so basically I had a call yesterday from a parent and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1643)|
| 0:27:36| question was, I believe that was their question, if their child shows that they have had COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| then could they not quarantine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| I think you're talking about the antibody test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| So is this two different things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Antigen tells you current infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Antibody tells past infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| But it does, now the important thing about antibody tests, and it's not just true for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| antibody tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Antibody tests are a challenge to interpret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| An antibody test for COVID does not tell you anything about the immunity of that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| We just don't know enough about COVID yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| So you can have a positive antibody test that tells us you had COVID at some point and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| still have an antibody, but the antibody may not be protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| So just an antibody positive result does not get you out of quarantine because you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| still be vulnerable to the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| And then one other question, and then I promise Ms. Phelps I'll come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| I know the CDC's recommendation is what played into, I believe, played into your thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| on tracing the kids and then the older population, but when you look at, like if I look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| data that breaks it down by age on the website, it says that cases per 10,000 for 0 to 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| is 255, and so it's the lowest of the age groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| So why...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| We want to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| But if you're trying to not spread it, it seems like you would do the 18 to 44 because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| that's the highest, and it seems like adults are passing it to each other much more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| than children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| So that's based on data that honestly I don't have that the CDC has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| They made those recommendations based on congregate settings and the risk of passing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| The more people you add together in a room, the more likely you are to pass COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| And so those are based on those recommendations from the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you, Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| And thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| And a lot has transpired since the last time you appeared before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| And let me go back because I don't know if the board realizes or not, but congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Dr. Buchanan was named the Powell High School Woman of the Year, Distinguished Woman of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| the Year for the Alumni Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| So up until that point, I did not realize you were a graduate of Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| So congratulations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| So first, as I recall, Mr. McMillan asked about the possibility of shortening the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| quarantined at the last meeting from 14 to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| And this idea was rejected, and the comments on social media were needless to say very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| ugly, nasty, and mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| However, now that the CDC has recommended, the Tennessee Department of Health and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Board of Health has adopted the CDC guidelines and shortened the quarantine period to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| days and 7 with a negative test, I just want to acknowledge Mr. McMillan for being very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| forward thinking and realize that some of those nasty comments were unwarranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| And then at the last meeting, Ms. Horn referenced Putnam County School Board that was no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| involved in the health department in their contact tracing of their students and had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| not seen no increase or difference in the number of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| So I'm glad that we are, even though I, like Ms. Horn, would like to see a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| demographic targeted, but I am happy that we are limiting that contact tracing because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| at the last meeting, I referenced the emails that I received from multiple parents about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| delayed notifications, and I think I sent you an email after that where it was stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| we were notified eight days after close contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| So at this point, my son had been around probably 100 plus people over Halloween, weekend school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| ball game practices, et cetera, and you did go back and I wanted to commend you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| and check with your staff, and then responded to me on November 16th that after speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| with your staff, it was likely due to the current lab turnaround time, and at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| it was five to seven days, you said, to get lab results across the community, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| means contacting the case and then the contacts as soon as we can after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| You were hoping that would get better, but the caseload has gone up, and so in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| it hasn't gotten better because after I tested positive for COVID, I was contacted on day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1941)|
| 0:32:30| 10 of a 10-day quarantine by the Knox County Health Department asking a lot of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| questions about contact tracing and that sort of thing, but that was 12 days after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| I had exposed people to that without symptoms and not knowing that I had COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| So by that time, I would assume most of those people that I was in close contact with 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| days later would have either shown symptoms, gotten the disease, been over the disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| or whatever, so fortunately, responsibly, I contacted all those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| They did the mandatory 14-day quarantine period and all of that, but, and lastly, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| just like to say I understand the severity of this disease, and we've lost some very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| close friends, but I'm personally thankful to have tested positive now because I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| like I do have better immunity than even possibly the vaccine can offer and feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| that I do have some level of immunity and probably do not pose an extreme risk to others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2016)|
| 0:33:45| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| So anyway, I don't expect any apologies from all those nasty, mean comments on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| but I do think it's up to the board to ask questions, and you've been very good to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| before this board and answer them and try to update the information, and none of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| know, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| I mean, we can read all we want to read on it, but it's still a very unknown factor out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| So thank you for all you've done, and congratulations on your award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| Yeah, I wanted to ask about the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| It sounds like possibly we're getting some here soon, and I was talking to Scott Bolton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| our HR person, about prioritization, and I did see at some level teachers are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| priority list, and so I'm trying to make sure that's true, and then with the dosing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| you're expecting coming in and stuff, when do we even sort of see that happening, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| possibly teachers might be eligible to get vaccines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| If you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Yeah, that's the great unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| We will be getting some vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| I don't know exactly how much yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| There are estimates of how much, but I won't count those until we have them in our hot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| little hands and we know exactly how much we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| Having been through several flu seasons and flu myths, you guys have been around for flu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| myths, you know sometimes it's like stop and start because the vaccine supply is not always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| as reliable as we'd like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| So the first one, the 1A, it's like 1A, 1B, and 1A2 or something, that's all first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2121)|
| 0:35:31| ER employees, nursing home residents, they just got added in, long-term care workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| So that's the first group, and we'll be vaccinating those folks probably for the next couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| months, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I think that teachers will be in the, what do they call it, critical infrastructure group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| The other group that's there are the nurses that work in the schools and the healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| people at UT that provide care for the students, and like if anybody else has a clinic, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| other long-term, any other educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| So I think teachers will be in the B group of critical infrastructure, but that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| to be determined at the state level by the unified command group and the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So I don't have that information yet, but I think they're in that second tier of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| first tier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| And I guess it's all going to depend on the number of doses that we're getting and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| it's uptake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| It is, it's all going to depend on availability and how quickly it actually comes out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| how much we get in uptake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| That's the other piece is if we get 2,000 doses and we're able to satisfy everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| in the first responder group with those 2,000 doses and have some left over, we'll move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| on to the next group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Because it's totally voluntary, unless employers make it mandatory, which employers certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| can do that, but it'll be voluntary and we'll be working hard to get that information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| so people are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| But I think teachers will stay in that critical infrastructure group, but I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| guarantee that because I don't have any input into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| Well, I really hope they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I mean, obviously, you know, I mean, I don't want to be in a group that's forcing anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| to get a vaccine that they don't feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| But I do think we are trying to educate our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| And I mean, obviously, I think healthcare workers come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| But I do think the teachers need to be pretty high up on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| And so I hope that at the state level, they will continue to consider them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Yeah, me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Yeah, I just want to say thank you for being here and also to your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I know you all are incredibly busy, but they always seem to make time to answer the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| that I've had or some of my parents have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| And as well as Ms. Wagner and Mr. Myers on the KCS staff, they've all, as busy as everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| is, I have to say they do respond quickly when people do have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| Yeah, my team is amazing and they continue to step up every time over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Yes, I just wanted to echo some of the comments that have already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I really appreciate the Knox County Health Department acting in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| You came before us in September and again just last month to say that you would be continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| looking at the CDC guidance and the state of Tennessee and the state of Tennessee Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| And I appreciate the deference in which you've treated that and been engaging continually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| even outside of those conversations with our KCS staff ever since the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| So I appreciate you all doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| And I also want to echo Ms. Bowne's comments about nasty emails being sent to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Brother, nobody ever deserves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| I mean, the reality is, you know, everybody's feeling strong things and we still need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| lift one another up and honor one another during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| So I hate that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| And I know Dr. Buchanan from watching your press conference yesterday, I know that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| a concern that there are a lot of this is really just as an aside, not for school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| but that there are a lot of people who need to go to the hospital who are not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| the hospital because they think because they're concerned about COVID or they think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| no room for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Can you just talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Because that's a serious issue for people who are whose cancer is not being addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| or whose heart issues are not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| So, so the hospitals are busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| I'm not going to say they're not at this time of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| But they have plans and they're activating those plans to free up space so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| can care for COVID and non COVID patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| They want to continue to be able to provide a high level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| I heard on the way over here that Covenant just announced they're stopping elective procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| that require an overnight hospital stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| So that'll free up some beds and staff to take care of whoever needs the care that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| So they've only begun, just begun to activate their surge plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| All their surge plans look slightly different because all of them look slightly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| But I, they, they're literally meeting every day to talk about capacity and what the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| are and what do we need to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| So our hospitals are working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| We're very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| That doesn't always happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| They compete in lots of ways, but in this situation, they're working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| And so I feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| If I had a need, a need to go to the hospital, I would go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| You're probably going to wait a while, but frequently the waits are high anyway in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| days and hospitals run at pretty full capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| So they're, they're able to accommodate the needs of the patients that come see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| It is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| We have another audience that may not have heard that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| So that's important to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| One other question that goes back to a comment Ms. Bounds made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| And I know you referenced it, I believe yesterday in listening to you speak about the turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| time on testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| That's been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| And, and, you know, in thinking about the impact of just, do you expect it to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| to be an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Honestly, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I think two things contribute to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| One is the sheer volume of testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| As our cases go up, more people are getting tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| I mean, we tested 450, I think, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So testing volume is going up, and not just at the health department, but across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| The other thing is, honestly, the reporting system is just overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| And so the, what has to happen is the result, you know, has to get completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| And then the result goes to the state lab into the reporting system and then comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| And so sometimes we're getting called by a patient before we ever hear from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| about the, I tested positive, what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| So that system is just overwhelmed by the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| And so that's slowing it down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| So the lab turnaround time, add to that the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| And so that's why we're saying to everybody, if you get tested for COVID, it is really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| whether you have symptoms or not, no matter why you get tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| you need to quarantine until you get test results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| So that means stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Don't accidentally expose people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| When you get test results, if you're negative, you're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| If you're positive, then you've got, you know, you've got your isolation period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| But it's important for people to stay home if they've been tested until they get those test results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| so that they don't accidentally expose people because nobody wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| Nobody wants to make their friends sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| We really appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| Item 12A, approve legislative priorities at the Knox County Board of Education for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| We have a motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| I'd like to offer a friendly motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| To approve the recommended changes before the board as in hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| I think everybody has a hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| If you'll take a few minutes to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2599)|
| 0:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2614)|
| 0:43:52| I'm happy to give some understanding about why I'm suggesting this change if it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| So this is obviously the first time that I've been through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| and don't have a lot of history with legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I appreciate the discussion at the last meeting talking about the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| and the need to get to a set of priorities that we as a board cohesively can lift up before our legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2651)|
| 0:44:20| That being said, I think just in terms of procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| I think to me it's just interesting from an approval standpoint that we approve them all as one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| because obviously each individual one of us may have very strong feelings about certain ones of these over others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| I'm not suggesting that we adjust the procedure tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| but I think in the future it would be good to look at doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| because I don't think a no vote should indicate to the public that somebody doesn't believe any of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| nor should I think a yes vote should indicate that a person believes in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| So in referencing the specific changes that I'm suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| under the school's voucher section, the Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| for consistency throughout the document, we continue to reference the Knox Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| and I thought it would be good to just make that consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| I also want to say, too, that I had nothing to do with drafting the original version of this, nor did I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| And so I'm extremely grateful for all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| I'm sure Ms. Owen and Mr. Thomas and others have had a tremendous amount of input in this over many, many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| and so I'm not here to presume to be an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| But under teacher performance evaluation, and I know that just by bringing this up I'm stepping into tricky waters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| I'm suggesting that we add the language right after Knox County Board of Education to maintain high standards for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| And the reason I say that is because that's obvious, we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| but I think one of the arguments just in my limited time in this space between legislators is around accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| and that sometimes there's this feeling that people don't expect high standards from teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| which to me is a ridiculous thing, and that's why people say they push for accountability so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| because we have to maintain high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| So I thought it would be good for us just to put it out there that, yes, we do maintain high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| And then when I first read this, I honestly thought we were trying to do what we did up above around the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| around hold harmless due to COVID, and so just jumping to the end of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| I think even though we approved a resolution, I think this is another opportunity to elevate that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| around holding teachers harmless related to state testing data for the 2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2794)|
| 0:46:43| And then within the lines of the 15 years of research has shown that student scores do not accurately measure teacher performance or effectiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| I actually reviewed a lot of those studies this past week, and I'll tell you it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| I actually looked for and could not find any studies that said that we need to be evaluating state test scores at 50% of a teacher's evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2816)|
| 0:47:06| I just couldn't find the research out there that said that, and I looked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| I did find at least five studies that said we do not need to be doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| but I didn't find any studies, frankly, that said we should not consider state testing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| And the reason that I suggested that we strip teacher evaluation scores should be decoupled from student testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| and moved it down to the hold harmless section is because I think common sense tells us that if a student is performing well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2848)|
| 0:47:38| it likely has something to do with teacher effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| So I'm not saying that it needs to be weighted at 50% or that our teacher evaluation calculations are absolutely crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2861)|
| 0:47:50| and I've read through a lot of those, but I think to say they should have nothing to do with a teacher's evaluation probably isn't accurate either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2870)|
| 0:48:02| And so I think the only thing that I was really concerned about is the language around decoupling, that it's completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| And I know there's strong opinions about this, and I'm not an expert, but from my brief reading of the research, I couldn't go as far as decoupling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2889)|
| 0:48:20| Okay. Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| If Dr. Rysluk would be so kind, if you would just remind us how value-added scores work, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, do you know what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2903)|
| 0:48:36| and what those scores actually mean, I think that would be helpful to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| Sure. Thank you, Ms. Owen. I'm probably not the most qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| I'd much rather Steve Rutter and somebody from our REA department do that, but I'll take a shot at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| The way you say it is always exactly perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| So I think what's interesting is for a long time, I think value-added people were like, 5 are better than 1s, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2932)|
| 0:49:01| And so I think that was that perception of you're doing better if you have a 5 than a 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| and really what it tells is it's the certainty with which people know the year's worth of growth happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2946)|
| 0:49:16| So if you're a 3, 4, 5, that typically means a teacher or a school or a district has enough data points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| so they feel very strongly that that year of growth took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| 1 or 2, they feel like there's enough data points to say that you potentially didn't make that full year of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| So if you score a 3, that usually means that there wasn't enough to say there was total proof of that or total proof not of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| Lots of times people think, well, a 3 is better than a 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Well, it could just be there's not enough sample size in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| So really what it's saying is the certainty with which that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and you're much more certain with a score of a 5 than obviously a score of a 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| So that's kind of what it looks at, and sometimes it's sample size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| the number of kids who are tested for an individual teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| And so we're basing our teacher evaluation scores on a number that says the degree of certainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| rather than the degree that they were effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| On the value-added portion, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| The achievement is a little different, but yes, that is on the value-added side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| Does that explain why they're not valid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Could you speak to the growth portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Could you speak then to the growth portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| I mean, you've talked about the value-added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Right, so the value-added would be the growth component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| The achievement would be the strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Oh, that's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| So the achievement would be, those are scores, and the way they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| I can't believe I'm doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Really, Steve Rudder needs to be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| But the way they do that is everyone is ranked in a grade and across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| So there's always going to be winners and losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| You think of it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| It's not a cut score that you could have 90% of the state above a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| because you're always going to rank everybody, all third graders that took the same test in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| And then there's a rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| That's why there's always a bottom 5% in every one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| And given year to year, you can see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| It's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| It's the same cohort of kids that come into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| But it really is a true achievement against Lightpeer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| Well, Lightpeer is maybe an exaggeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| It is a true score against, like, all other third graders that took the test in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| when you look at those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| So that's set on achievement that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| I don't know if that helps or if that's what you were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| And, Dr. Reiser, I appreciate your explanation about the value-added models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| which I forgot to address this, but I did add language related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Obviously, one of the struggles with value-added models is they don't account for a tremendous amount of other variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| You may have one teacher that's teaching this set of kids this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| and then this next year they're teaching a totally different set of kids in a totally different school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| and there's a lot of environmental factors that might influence the value-added portion of that person's evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| And sometimes what we see in our schools that have been historically lower performers is that they tend to be able to make some gains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| in that growth because, you know, they're moving off the baseline this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| They can have a good year, and their growth may show where their overall achievement may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| You'll see that sometimes in schools that struggle in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| But, yeah, it is different cohorts every year, not the same kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| We can look at a kid longitudinally, and that's how they make projections for the following years for the grades they move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| But for a teacher who just teaches third grade, it is a different cohort that comes through every time, every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Has there been any change in the percentage of teachers who have to rely on data from other classes, from classes they don't teach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3152)|
| 0:52:42| I know that long ago, like 2012, it was about 60% of our teachers were scored by tests that were not their subject area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3162)|
| 0:52:55| So they had, there was no test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| There's no part of the TCAP that's going to test my music class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| But my score is going to be based on how they did in the classes they are tested on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| Do we know if that percentage is still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| Just enough to not get dangerous, and then it may be a Scott Bolton question for sure on numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| So you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| So if there's not a state test for that grade level or that subject area, well, that grade level, state and elementary, or K-8, or 3-8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3196)|
| 0:53:26| then they typically do have another measure they pick that's a school-wide measure that they may or may not have direct control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| as far as it goes to school overall score and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| As far as how many we have in that, that may be a Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Sorry, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| He may have better shot at that than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| And I think my 60% was generally across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| So I'm not looking for a hard number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| Madam Chair, the rest of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Honestly, I'll have to get those numbers for you to be exact, because I'm not for sure off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| The court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3243)|
| 0:54:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| So we currently have a substitute or a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| A friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| So Ms. Owen made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Did she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Ms. Owen made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| And Ms. Aberdeen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| And Ms. Satterfield seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| So, Ms. Owen, before we go on to more conversation, are you willing to accept the friendly amendment or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| I'm good with all of it except limiting all of this to the 2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3277)|
| 0:54:52| Can I make a clarifying statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| My intent with the whole teacher harmless section is that is operating as a separate piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| That to me, there's two statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| There's the overall legislative priority around teacher performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| And then there is the same thing we did with the VEP section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| There was the bullet point around holding harmless with VEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| That this particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| The other reason why I think it's important to call that out is I think legislators are going to be more sensitive to that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| And I think it's important to elevate that in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| And not try to tackle, not that we shouldn't try to tackle the bigger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| But we certainly need to get the fruit we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| And I think it's important to spell that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| For the same reason I assume we did for the VEP funding section that talks about holding harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3335)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| Ms. Owen, are you agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| I don't feel good limiting it to this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| So whatever the board decides, I'll go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| But I don't feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Can you pull your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| I'm saying that I don't feel good with the limitation of just this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| I will go with whatever the board decides, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| But I don't feel good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| Ms. Owen, can you specify the piece that you're saying is limited to this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3385)|
| 0:56:35| What specific phrase are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| No bearing on individual teacher evaluations for the 2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3401)|
| 0:56:53| Can I make it a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Anyone want a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| We have a second for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| So the hard copy that you're presented with now is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| And I don't know who had their mic down first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Is the substitute motion, is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| This is now, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| This is the substitute motion that we are discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Not that I'm friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Not friendly toward Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| I'm still friendly toward Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| I just want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| What you're wanting to do is just do it for this one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| No, maybe it's just the way I have it worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| I think there's some confusion about my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| My intent is to say, is to elevate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| I think we have a real chance of getting the legislature to act on decoupling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| the way it was originally worded, test scores from teachers evaluations for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| And I think as a board of education, if we believe that should happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| then I think we need to elevate that in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| And so my intent is to try to get the gains that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| And my intent is not to try to make a long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| not to try to say that that particular section is something that we would keep on here forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| but would need to be re-evaluated with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| Well, and if I may, I think that during these times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| I think that legislators are going to be focused on COVID issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| COVID, they're not going to think beyond that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| So I'm not sure that, you know, I'm not sure it would matter if we were asking for something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| I don't think they're going to address it right now because they're going to be focused on COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| And just so everybody knows this, I spoke with Representative Zachary this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| and the governor is considering, he's evaluating whether to have a special session before the session begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3544)|
| 0:59:13| So when they go back into session on the second Tuesday of January, it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| they're just discussing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| but it may be that they hold a special session to consider education issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| so that these issues that we're discussing can be addressed sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| So hopefully they will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| And hopefully our teachers then would know what the ramifications are for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| Ms. Bob, Mr. McMillan, did you have anything else for the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| Well, I want to make a comment, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| I talked to Mr. Dupler about this, so I don't know parliamentary-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| do I need to wait for this to finish to bring up what I want to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| I mean, I'll say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| I just don't know parliamentary-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| Parliamentary-wise, I mean, you can make another substitute or you can make an amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| I mean, we can stack them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Okay, because I'm not, I mean, I kind of, this goes back to something Mr. Watson said originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Can you have another substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| Can you have another substitute motion without voting on the one that's already on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| Well, it was my, it has been my understanding that you had to dispense with that one and then before you went to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3631)|
| 1:00:43| Now, he can pull his back if he wishes, but you can't have two at the same time, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| Now, I might be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| It's been a long time since I've dealt with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Well, one could ask to amend the substitute, which would basically have the same effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| I think you're right as far as you can't have two substitutes, but one could ask to amend the substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| but right now, until we have that motion, the board can only discuss the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Okay, so do you have something relative to the substitute motion, Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| It goes back to what Mr. Watson was talking about originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| I think we do priorities, but I think the way this is presented, when we're trying to individually vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| I personally don't necessarily agree with every single one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| Now, if the board goes through them all and votes for all of them, I will support what the board supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| but I would like us to vote individually on these because I do think there are different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| and I think we are just being given this as one big package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| So I wanted to put forth an amendment which is a little different than his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| because I don't necessarily have a problem with him amending this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| but I would like to amend the way we vote on this and that we vote on each of these separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| I'll be honest, I sort of equate it to what we see in Congress when they shove things through because one thing is popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think any of us disagree with full funding of BEP and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| but I think there are individuals, and I think when it all comes in one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| when we're just given one slate to vote on, and we all might be for every single one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3752)|
| 1:02:41| but if the majority of us is not for all of these or one of these, does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| It does. The only problem is that you can't then call it legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| because then it's just a loose group of resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| They would just be resolutions at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Well, I guess the way I think about it is, I almost would number them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| Say if there are five here, if we all vote, if the majority vote for all five of them, then they all go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| If one of the five, a majority of us does not vote for, then that one would be taken off the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| and the four would be presented as the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| You might personally not have voted for one of them, but as a body, that individual thing has been voted on by the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| It's just kind of like when we do resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| We don't always necessarily have 100% that vote for it, but as a board, we are all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| And I think you kind of spoke to that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Well, I also think by doing it that way, it actually puts more weight behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| because the public understands, okay, all nine of them really value this one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| Whereas if you're just voting on the document as a whole, I think the public is smart enough to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| that there's no way that if somebody says no, they mean no to the whole thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| So to me, it makes you mean more what you actually mean when you say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| So again, I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| Well, I think you can, okay, because I think you can, you may be able to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| but I think it probably has to be a, I think it doesn't carry much weight as a list of priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3853)|
| 1:04:21| if it's not a list of priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| So I think you lose the whole fact of having priorities if it's not a cohesive document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| So it could be that you might be able to vote, I mean, just looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| I mean, we could have five or six different votes here to determine that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| but then I think you either have priorities or you don't, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| I don't think you can list a priority and say on school vouchers you had eight out of nine board members agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3885)|
| 1:04:53| I don't know, I think it's kind of like with a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| We don't send it with our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| It's like if vouchers have like a 7-2 vote, it goes forward as from the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| and I think that's how when we make votes, it's the majority rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| So I think it's possible to vote on it individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| So let's have some more conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| I'd like to put it out there, and the majority of people might disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| Let's have some conversation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| That brings up a different thing than him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| I would just like the history, if anybody could speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| because other than Mr. McMillan, who is nice to how we came to be doing this legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3926)|
| 1:05:36| and sending this in, because what I was going to say is you've been here longer than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| Well, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| But in the time that I've been here, this is how we've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| I don't know that we have to do it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| I do think to speak to Susan, everything I've always heard is that it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| it doesn't have to be a 9-0 vote, but it is very important when it goes to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3954)|
| 1:06:03| that it appears to be a unified board on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| So if we want to do what Mr. Watson suggested and what Ms. Pabst suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| I think going forward in future years, unless there's a reason not to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| it would be better to do it in a smaller committee meeting that can be attended by all board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3977)|
| 1:06:25| open to the public, and then bring it to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| so that you have more of a consensus when it comes to the floor of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| than having to do an individual vote that night of each one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| which appears very discombobulated to me and ununified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| Now, if somebody, Mr. McMillan or Terry or Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| somebody can speak to why we do this and how we've done it in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| I would appreciate it because this is what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| I'll make a comment or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Of course, the superintendent has been around and seen a lot of these since he's been involved over the years up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4019)|
| 1:07:08| But, and you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| but I think we've always, at least since I came on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| we've always been presented, you know, with, they may have asked board members what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| there's some things that you automatically want on the priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| It's just a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| But then they take suggestions and then we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| And if you objected to something, then you voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Ms. Bounds is right that it's stronger if it goes over there 9-0 as opposed to 8-1 or 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4062)|
| 1:07:54| And, but I think, excuse me, quite honestly, with the COVID and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4074)|
| 1:08:08| they're not going to be focused that much this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| They're going to try to get through things as best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| They're not going to be worried about what a priority of the school board in Knox County was in their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| Now, I'm not saying they won't look at it, Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| but, you know, they're not going, it's not going to really have that much impact in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4111)|
| 1:08:41| While I've got the floor, apparently, I want to make a, did I say anything that you disagreed with, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| You did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| And I've seen it done both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| I've seen it where at times the board secretary would take, board members would submit to the board secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| and then it would go through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| And then I've seen times when there may be some workshop devoted to developing this and then discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| and then everybody would come to agreement and it would be on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| So I've seen it done both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Yeah, and that's how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| You know, we asked for feedback and Ms. Owen provided some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| I'm not sure if anybody else did, but I know Ms. Owen provided some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| I made a couple of alterations to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| So that's what we, you know, what we've been doing the past handful of years, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| I guess it would just, I think it would be nice, and I have to say like last week I was remote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| and didn't have any sound either, so I couldn't bring up stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| But I do think it's one thing for different board members to have different priorities of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| but then I do think there needs to be a time when we can have a discussion as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| do we agree with Ms. Owen's priority or maybe it's Ms. Bowne's priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| You know, I mean, I think we all have different things that go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| but I think it's hard when it all comes to us and it's yay or nay on the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| when you might not agree with parts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| If I could interject something, in the past we've always been able to have some kind of meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4204)|
| 1:10:14| prior to the legislative session with the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| Which we're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| A lot of stuff has come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| They can get a feel, you know, this board split on this particular issue, so and so feels this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| And I think that's helped tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| Now, the chair is right in that sometimes things, even in the spring workshop, retreat, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4237)|
| 1:10:50| it will start there with somebody mentioning it and carry out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| But I don't think it's going to make that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| Well, I think you're right, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| I think the meeting that we'll have with our legislative delegation in early January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| is going to be more productive than this anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| But, you know, it's nice to have something that helps guide discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| And I thought in the years past that really that was what this was developed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| It wasn't so much about sending it to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| It was what we wanted to discuss with our legislators when we met prior to the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| And that, to a large point or part, is determined by the board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| Going back many years, the two years I served as chair, the chair before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| they developed, with the input from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| but they developed and they presented in various ways how that legislative meeting was conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4310)|
| 1:11:59| And we've conducted it in different ways for the board chair, just presented our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| But I never felt like this was such a weighty document that went to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| that we needed to do individual votes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| It was just like, here's some ideas that we want to discuss with our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| when we get together in January rather than just helter-skelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| I don't think they're spending a lot of time reading it, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| No, I don't think so either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| And I think we're giving it way too much credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| I think you're exactly right, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| And that's what we missed this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| In the past, I can almost assure you that when we had lunch or cookies and coffee or whatever we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4359)|
| 1:12:49| they will remember what was said there, whereas they may never even look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| But what I wanted to say a moment ago was we were talking about scores when John was up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| you know, going back some years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| We had a discussion on the board several years ago about those scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4389)|
| 1:13:17| and it was some people might be, might score, they might be a very good teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4397)|
| 1:13:25| and they might score three plus and near the four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| but they wouldn't ever be able to get to the four or to the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4410)|
| 1:13:37| And it was pretty much of a consensus that that wasn't a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| That was just their style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| You know, they didn't have to make an A plus from their perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| I just wanted everybody to appreciate and say that they were a, he or she was a quality teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4433)|
| 1:14:04| So I don't know whether that helps anybody or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| But as far as the testing part, I will say this, this is my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| but at some point I don't think that we will be able to put the legislature off much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4457)|
| 1:14:32| No matter how much we protest, they are going to demand that students be evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4472)|
| 1:14:42| and some form of it tied to the teacher's test score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| But we haven't thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Something has happened every year that we've lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| But it is coming, I feel sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| I want to make sure we get in the other people who have their mics down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| I just want to say, Ms. Babb, I agree with you about breaking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| I would love to see it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| And I don't know if this is an appropriate document that we could review in policy review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| I don't know since the board is here as a whole, I don't know if that would be an appropriate place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| But I do want to say that I agree with you and thank you for bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| First, I would say that this, the process of approval, I believe worked much better when we did it in fall workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4536)|
| 1:15:45| the two-day workshop when we could talk about it and come to consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| I think a lot of the language that is in this version of it came from those workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| What we have here does align with everything we voted for with TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| And so that's important that our legislative priorities also align with other school boards in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| There was a time historically when our document was important to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| And this is a personal story before I was a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| I was in an education committee meeting and one of the legislators read a letter from one of our board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4581)|
| 1:16:31| written on letterhead, that sounded like this board opposed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| But the legislative priorities, well, it sounded like they supported something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| I'm sorry, I'm backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| It sounded like this board was in support of what this legislator was trying to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| But the legislative priorities of this board said otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| And having this document and being able to send that to someone else on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| they were able to say, but wait, the Knox County priorities say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| And that can be really important in a deliberative session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| when you have one person making it sound like boards in the state support something that they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4632)|
| 1:17:22| And when other people on the committee can look and see the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| it's important that they can have those facts in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| So even though we may not feel like it gets any traction anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| and it doesn't feel like it is given much weight by our legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| I think it's important for them to have it in writing so that they can see exactly what is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Back to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| We do these every year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| So I do think that the situation with the pandemic needs to be the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| I mean, let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| There are some people that are never going to agree with decoupling teacher evaluations from student testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4689)|
| 1:18:20| But they might agree this year to do that, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| And, you know, I don't think that teachers don't want to be held accountable either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| I mean, they want a fair system, which obviously there's a lot of problems with the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4710)|
| 1:18:40| But I do like what Mr. Watson has done here as far as making the language specifically related to COVID-19 in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4720)|
| 1:18:53| Because this year, more than ever, we need this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| And I prefer for the focus to be this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| I mean, next year we can go back and revisit it and talk about it and do it however everybody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4741)|
| 1:19:09| I do think that this year the focus needs to be on what we need now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| So on the agenda, obviously, it says that these are recommended by the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| So obviously there would be the board's legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| But you have some stake in it and you have some thoughts about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Can I ask your thoughts about the relative importance about lifting the priority around holding teachers harmless in light of COVID-19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4770)|
| 1:19:41| We had just a couple days ago a superintendent study council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| And when I say that, that's a group of superintendents made up of surrounding counties and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| And the superintendent study council has a priority list as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| This is on that list, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| And what the superintendents were asking for was a one-year hold harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| I think that's consistent with the resolution that the board approved, the language we had in the resolution last month, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4802)|
| 1:20:10| So I think our thought pattern was the best chance of getting something is to put a time frame on it, like the 2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4810)|
| 1:20:20| Because I think a bigger discussion around evaluation probably is a whole other issue, I guess, that the legislators may want to discuss at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4820)|
| 1:20:31| So again, our thought and the superintendent's thoughts are if we can get our legislators to give us this only one-year hold harmless, that would be what we would ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4831)|
| 1:20:40| But again, there's been lots of discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| And I think it's a bigger issue than what we can make it at this point, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4845)|
| 1:20:54| I'm happy with the resolution that the board approved in November, because that's what we drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| I know John was involved, and Ron, and Gary, I think, some other folks involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| So again, the superintendents were asking for a one-year hold harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| So that's kind of my thoughts about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Ms. Fab, you had your mic down, and then Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| Yeah, I mean, I think maybe my individual, I don't know that there's traction for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| I would like us to maybe look at next year, how we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| My thing is, I totally support the hold teachers harmless this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| I think the decoupling of assessments, I think that's a much bigger discussion around evaluations overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4892)|
| 1:21:42| And I don't know that I support the first part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| I totally support the hold teachers harmless, and that's probably my biggest issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| But I do know that there are other people on this board that feel differently about vouchers and different other things about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| So that's kind of why I wanted to break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| But my specific issue is on this, I really would like to keep it COVID-19 specific for what we know the legislature is going to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4918)|
| 1:22:08| what we think is realistic to get through with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| And I fully support that hold teachers harmless part that we've already done a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| whereas I do have issues with the part in front of that, even with Mr. Watson's revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4937)|
| 1:22:25| So to clarify, you would prefer that we take out the whole paragraph and only have the hold teachers harmless section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4945)|
| 1:22:37| That would be my preference, but that's not the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Okay, I'm just making sure I understand your thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| But I just kind of wanted to put forward kind of my particular reason why I wanted to break this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| But if we're not going to, I kind of wanted to state what my issue was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| I would like to see that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| I think it just makes it a shorter document and makes our needs for this year pretty clear and to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4977)|
| 1:23:13| Okay, Mr. McMillan, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| Well, I guess I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| Now, when you talk about taking out the paragraph, are you talking about taking out everything from where it says local controls of school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=4998)|
| 1:23:28| All of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Or are you talking about where it says teacher performance evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| Or school vouchers, everything after school voucher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Personally, what I would like to see, but this is different than what Mr. Watson has put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| Mr. Watson's done what is in red right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| What I would prefer is to take out, have the title teacher performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| And then from the Knox County Board of Education, that paragraph down to additionally student testing, that taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| And our priority this year being about holding teachers harmless this year during COVID as far as decoupling the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5040)|
| 1:24:09| I mean, that's my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| But you want to, I'm not sure I understand, Ms. Babb, exactly what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| You want to take out, just from right here, the whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5060)|
| 1:24:28| Everything except this part right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Starting right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| This would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| That would be what you take out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| What would be included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| This would be left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| All this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| From teacher performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Is there anybody that objects to any of the first four bullets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| I guess we should ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Well, I think, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| To back up just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| I think the consensus that I'm hearing is that we feel like we need to fix this document this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| Because if we want legislative priorities that we can discuss in January, today's our day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| So we need to fix this document so that we're all happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| Next year going forward, we need to make sure that we have on our fall retreat agenda this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| So we can make sure that you bring your ideas and we can hammer out what we want it to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| So that when we could pass it, you know, in November next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| And I think we all agree it's important that we have this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Because even though I think Ms. Owen said it well, even if they're not going to read it, at least you have it and we can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5138)|
| 1:25:46| If we don't have this, none of us can speak except for the chair can speak on behalf of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| And I don't think that we want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| I think we need every one of us to be empowered to be able to speak on behalf of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| But you can only do that if you have this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| So if we, so let's focus, so currently to make sure we're on the same page, we have a substitute motion with this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5162)|
| 1:26:14| So Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| I'm okay with adjusting my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| And going with the suggestion that Ms. Babb offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Although just for consistency, I would like to change under school vouchers, the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| When we say the board, I think we need to be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| Well, I don't think that's a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| So I think we can change that without a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| So I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Can I ask a question, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Do we really need anything from, could we not just drop school vouchers down to that last line that says hold teachers harmless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5203)|
| 1:26:58| Well, I tell you what, if we want to change something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| We could actually move, so that we are focusing on COVID, we could actually move the local control of schools up to under funding for public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5225)|
| 1:27:18| Move that up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| And then you have the listing of the BEP formula issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| And then so that immediately following that would be the hold teachers harmless section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| And then move vouchers down to under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| Just kind of rearrange it so that our priorities are more reflective of the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| There might be some division on vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| Do you want to really try to put that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| Or would you be willing to just, that was what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| This year, it would be better just to include, do what you said, but just move the hold teachers harmless down there in red, the last part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5271)|
| 1:28:04| Right above, the sentence right above school grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| Move it up to under the hold harmless BEP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| Or under local control of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| Wherever y'all want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| But I don't think we need to talk about school vouchers in general if we're not going to talk about teacher performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5301)|
| 1:28:31| I think they're totally different subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| I think they're different subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| They are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| Some of the board might not be comfortable about talking about the vouchers or might not vote for it if it did include what the statement here about the vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5321)|
| 1:28:53| I was just trying to take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| We can all voice concern and be opposed to vouchers if you want to individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5337)|
| 1:29:07| But if you take that out and move that up, just for this year, would that not take care of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5347)|
| 1:29:17| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Do we think that there would be, I wouldn't think that vouchers would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| Will they be this year, you think, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| Yes, they will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| I would also say that local control of schools, the reason that is pulled out and separate is because there are legislators who want to remove all local boards of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5368)|
| 1:29:39| No, I didn't mean for it to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| I'm just addressing what you said about moving it up under something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| No, but it would be its own thing still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I'm just saying move this whole section as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| I just want everybody to understand that there are legislators who do want to do away with all local boards and control everything at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5394)|
| 1:30:04| So, it's important that that can stand alone wherever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| No, and I was not saying it shouldn't. I just said it should move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Would this all be easier if I just went back and accepted that friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| It looks pretty good right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| I think we're past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| Okay, let's get some calm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Well, I was just going to say, going all the way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| Daniel, I do like the, and I understand where Ms. Owen is coming from because we both come out of the teaching profession and we see the harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5436)|
| 1:30:46| But I do like for the 2021 school year that you offered as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| And I like, Ms. Horn, what you said about moving it up because I think that needs to be a top priority for this board for our teaching profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5453)|
| 1:31:02| That they are held harmless for this year and we'll fight the bigger fight down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| I will say that we have a whole position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| So, school vouchers have not gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| They still are tied up in the courts right now, it's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| But we have created a whole position in Nashville for a former legislator in regard to his working on school vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5479)|
| 1:31:29| So, it has not gone away. It is stronger than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| And I feel like, you know, next year we can go through it in the fall workshop and do as Ms. Babb and Ms. Henderson and Mr. Watson suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5493)|
| 1:31:45| And go through and vote individually, fine tune this document before it ever comes to this floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| But I do think for this year that we need to, we can move it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| It doesn't have to be at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| What concerns me more than vouchers almost is the A-F grading of public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| But that hasn't even been discussed and that's a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| So, but I do think the whole teacher's harmless needs to be at the top as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| And I support getting rid of that paragraph this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| If it offends three or four or five board members on this board, we can fight that fight down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| But I know there's a lot of teachers out there that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| I agree, I agree with that Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| I think right now we need to make sure that we're holding teachers harmless currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| So, I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| I would be okay with getting rid of that paragraph and then moving it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| So, is that your friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Okay, so could I propose this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Well, you would have to propose it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| Moving the local control of schools up so that that section is kind of the second mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| And then putting the school vouchers under, toward the bottom, either above or below grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| So, my friendly amendment that was a substitute is now going to be friendly again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| So, my friendly amendment is to move the section that says local control of schools directly above the section that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5592)|
| 1:33:20| Knox County Board of Education urges the General Assembly to amend the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| And then the second piece of my friendly amendment would be to strip the paragraph under teacher performance evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5604)|
| 1:33:32| from the words of the Knox County Board of Education to the words unreliable in both execution and delivery of scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5612)|
| 1:33:40| To strip that piece of the paragraph and then bring the teacher performance evaluation section up above school vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5620)|
| 1:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| And let me think. We need a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| Okay, Ms. Mab seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Okay, Mr. McMillan, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Well, no, not exactly, but I guess it's more of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| But you're going to leave school vouchers in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| That is his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| That's my suggestion as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| Well, what under teacher performance, you want Knox County Board of Ed and then where do you want to go to from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5658)|
| 1:34:30| Would it help if I labeled the sections in order as I'm proposing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| So, section number one would be local control of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| Section number two would be the Knox County Board of Education urges the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| Section number three would be teacher performance evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| Section number four would be school vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| And section number five would be school grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| But you're also under teacher performance evaluation getting rid of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| Stripping that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| I was just trying to address the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| So, what are we going to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| We're voting on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| That's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| So, unless we have other questions, we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| We're voting on the friendly substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| Whatever it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| So, what we're voting on right now is the amendment and then another vote for the full document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| The amendment on the floor was changed to a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| So, you'd just be voting on a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| It becomes the new motion since it's a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| So, there would be one vote on this document, not two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| No, that's not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| So, the most recent substitute motion that was just described by Mr. Watson is what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| And if five or more vote for that, then this board's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| If it's voted down, then you go back to the original, which is what is printed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| So, I think we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Mr. McMillan, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| No, I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| So, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Can we have a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| We can have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5790)|

| 1:36:35| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5795)|

| 1:36:42| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| So, we have a 7-2 motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Ms. Coatney will rework this as Mr. Watson's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| And we will then be able to go forward and have conversations based on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| We will, I've already talked to some of the delegation about meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| So, we will likely, they will go back into session January 12th, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| So, hopefully the week prior to that, possibly on January 8th, we'll try to schedule some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| So, if you can tentatively block off January 8th, we'll try to let you know as soon as possible if that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| And that will be, we've done, I mean, I know Mr. McMillan and Ms. Bounds have been to several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5852)|
| 1:37:41| And I've been to several now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| And truly the best is when it's a very, the best ones we've had have been very informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| And so, that's what our goal will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| We'll be as informal as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Last year was not even informal enough in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Sometimes they get a little, a little fiery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| But, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| They're always friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| They're always friendly and informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| You get to know where different people stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| I think I've missed one maybe in the years that I've been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| It's always productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| So, I would encourage everyone to try to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| And now we are ready to move to the added agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Discussion of possibility of moving to electronic meetings if Governor extends order past December 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| So, now you all are ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| Let me add this to the agenda after I took up all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| I do have a prepared statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| This is a statement that I think you all will have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| But, I know we're, especially given Dr. Buchanan being here tonight, we're all aware of the unfolding situation regarding COVID-19 in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5924)|
| 1:38:53| All of the key metrics regarding the pandemic from the Knox County Health Department are currently read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| We have seen the Board of Health take action to mandate limiting groups gatherings of 10 or less when members of that group are not from the same household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| Knox County has been in the red zone according to the White House Coronavirus Task Force since November 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| Given our current situation locally, I'd like the Board to have discussion and consider moving its monthly workshops and meetings virtually should the Governor extend Order 65, I believe, past December 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5951)|
| 1:39:25| I'm not making this recommendation out of fear, but I believe it is the best interest of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| To date, 189, this was as of two days ago, 189 of our Knox County neighbors have died from COVID and our medical professionals are overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5970)|
| 1:39:39| As leaders and elected officials, we know it's incumbent for us to lead out of example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| I believe that this is the right example for us to set for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| This decision is also in line with decisions KCS and other elected bodies have made recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| On 11-19, KCS staff reinforced guidance from our own Workforce Management Plan asking that all meetings regarding KCS business to occur virtually whenever possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=5992)|
| 1:40:01| Our own DEO's public meeting this Thursday will also be virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Other local elected bodies have recently taken the same action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| This week, in fact, County Commission decided to move their December meetings to virtual while the City Council, Board of Health, UT Board of Trustees, and the Knox County Planning Commission have all been meeting virtually since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6008)|
| 1:40:20| I know that we all feel more connected as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| I certainly feel that and appreciate the opportunity to be with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| I know the body language helps me a ton, but I don't think that's enough of a reason for us to continue to do so in light of the unfolding situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| I also feel strongly that should we choose and are able to hold virtual meetings, that we do keep intact public forum and find a way to do that in a virtual setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6034)|
| 1:40:45| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Ms. Owen, did you have a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| How indefinitely are you asking for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| Do metrics change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| I'm not making a proposal because this is our last meeting in December and we don't know what the governor is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| I wanted to bring it up as a point of discussion to see how the board feels about that as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| So that way, should the governor extend it, we can act on it and not come to in-person meetings again when we don't intend to to make a decision or to feel if that's something we want to do as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6071)|
| 1:41:23| So I'm really trying to get a feel of the room to see if that's a direction we would want to move should the governor extend his order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| Okay. Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| So, Mr. Watson, it's all contingent upon what the governor decides at the end of the month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| No, I don't think it's contingent, but from what I understand, Mr. Dupler, we can't make the decision to have virtual meetings past December 27th because the governor's order would not allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6099)|
| 1:41:48| So I don't think we make our decisions based on the governor's order, but we're limited in the decisions we can make when the order expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6108)|
| 1:41:55| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Yes, Mr. Watson is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| He and I discussed this briefly before this meeting, and that is a limiting factor because normally this board would be required to meet in person and have a quorum and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6123)|
| 1:42:14| So this executive order has been in effect for most of the year at this point, and if it's extended, then this board would still have the opportunity to appear virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6134)|
| 1:42:27| Otherwise, there's a board policy on it and state law, and it's very specific, usually for work or for illness or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6147)|
| 1:42:35| Thank you, Mr. Dupler. Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| Yes, I guess this is for you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| Students return assuming that they're able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6165)|
| 1:42:57| If they're not in this last round, they return on what, June 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6177)|
| 1:43:04| January 5th or 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| Are you still in favor if the majority of schools are open and in doing this virtual meeting for the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6187)|
| 1:43:23| Yes, sir. I appreciate that comment, Mr. McMillan, and that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| So I think we have way less variables and limitations to conduct our business in a virtual environment than students do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| And so I don't want to make decisions about how this board operates based upon how our Knox County school system is operating because it's a different function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6215)|
| 1:43:45| We're a policymaking body that I think can more easily do our work in a virtual space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| I know it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| I mean, I was on a virtual meeting for the Knox County Joint Education Task Force this past Monday, and it was not fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| Of course, it wasn't Zoom. Not everybody was there. I was just the only one virtual, and so I get the frustrations with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6238)|
| 1:44:05| Let me ask you another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Just for argument's sake, let's assume that things get better, and I guess we won't know until schools are either able to reopen one day and see what it's like for a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6247)|
| 1:44:26| But do you not think that we're a little bit different from the commission and some of these other boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6266)|
| 1:44:35| Do you not think that it would be hypocritical for us to open the schools and then for us to do virtual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6275)|
| 1:44:44| Yes, sir. I appreciate that question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| So I appreciate the bringing up the possibility of hypocrisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| I want to point us back to 111.19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| We all received an email stating that KCS staff is reinforcing guidance related to our own approved workforce management plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6298)|
| 1:45:07| asking that all meetings regarding KCS business, which we're in the process of conducting, to occur virtually whenever possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6307)|
| 1:45:15| And my feeling in that is it is possible for us to meet virtually, and we should honor what we're asking in terms of the way we conduct business type of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6315)|
| 1:45:26| Well, then when would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Mr. McMillan, I don't have the information to decide that, and it's not my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| That's why I wanted to bring it up for a point of discussion with the board to hear what other people are thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| Yeah, I mean, it's the decision of the executive committee, so the point of the conversation would really just be to get feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| and then the superintendent and I would make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| I agree with Mr. McMillan's stance on the precedence that it can send if we do have schools open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6350)|
| 1:45:58| With us not being here, I also understand the perspective of the meeting aspect that was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| but I think that if personally, I would love to just be on Zoom, but I do think that if we are having our teachers go to work every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| then we need to show up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| So depending on what happens, that's where I personally stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| Ms. Fab, I think you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| I think I'm in agreement with Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| I totally appreciate Mr. Watson's discussion of it because I think we've got two opposing issues going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| There is public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| There is the following, you know, trying to be as safe as possible, trying to keep as many people as safe as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6391)|
| 1:46:38| but I do hate to be a board of education of our schools that is not willing to meet in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6398)|
| 1:46:46| but yet we're wanting our teachers, principals, administrators to be in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| So I fully appreciate what you're saying, but I'm really torn about it because now I will put this caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6410)|
| 1:47:01| If in January our schools are virtual, then I think I would have a different feel about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| but I think if our schools are in person, I feel like we need to set the example of being in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| Since you're trying to get a feel as you all meet as an executive committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| I would agree with Ms. Satterfield and Mr. McMillan and Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| And I do think while a lot of the other bodies of Knox County are doing virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6444)|
| 1:47:32| I do think we are a little bit different as a school system and we don't have to fall under their guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| So I do think, as Ms. Babb said, if we're virtual in January, then that's an entirely different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6459)|
| 1:47:47| But if the schools are open and we're expecting teachers and students to be there, then I think we need to meet as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| Thank you, Ms. Bounds. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| I've heard a lot of concern from teachers who are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| why is the board meeting in person when we are being told not to meet in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| And looking at that, they feel that same idea that there is hypocrisy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| So I think it's important that we carefully consider the example that we're setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6494)|
| 1:48:22| whether we are truly following the guidelines that have been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| If Knox County Schools Administration says no more than 10 should be meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| then clearly we are not following those guidelines ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| And so it's difficult to ask our schools to enforce something that we are ignoring ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6515)|
| 1:48:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| Just my vote, I think we're much more productive when we're in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| I think tonight's conversation would have been extremely difficult to have over Zoom because it's just not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| And my gut feeling is that if we're expecting our teachers to be in the building, that we ought to be able to be in person as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6537)|
| 1:49:06| And I would concur, if we're on read, then we can breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| That may be a different conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| We have a 48-hour notice, so we can decide up to 48 hours prior to our meetings whether we're going to move the venue or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6552)|
| 1:49:20| because that would be the public notice deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| So we can be flexible to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| And I appreciate the line that you guys are bringing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| I do think, as Ms. Owen said, that we do have to acknowledge that we have asked teachers not to gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| for the purpose of simply conducting business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| And so right now we're kind of cutting the lines between functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| And so in one hand, we're saying don't meet virtually if you're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| And then we're saying to teach students in person, you obviously have to be in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| And I'm not saying that we shouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| But what I'm saying is I don't know that the decision of the board to meet in person to conduct business is as clear as we're expecting our teachers to teach in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6600)|
| 1:50:09| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| We might want to ask the superintendent and his staff to go back and revisit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| because when I got those guidelines about what was virtual and what was not virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| I had a lot of questions in my own mind because having taught on a staff of a school that had like 90 staff people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6622)|
| 1:50:31| I could totally understand not holding a faculty meeting in person with 100 people crammed into the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6631)|
| 1:50:39| But, and I don't know, Mr. Roslick probably could go back and they could look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| But, you know, I've also been heard from parents that were very upset that they were having to do virtual IEPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| when that could be no more than five or six people in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| So I think it's a larger question that maybe the superintendent and his staff need to look at before January as to clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6657)|
| 1:51:07| And maybe it was just on my part I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| But, you know, there's all kinds of meetings that happen throughout the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| So I understand the intent for people to minimize their meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| because if anybody knows how many meetings a teacher can attend in a week, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| And some I find less than necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| But still, you know, there's a big variance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| So that would just be my question as to looking at that, revisiting that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6694)|
| 1:51:40| Yeah, I would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| I think that we have, we need to be able to trust our staff to make decisions for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6702)|
| 1:51:50| And so if we have principals who deem, and I agree, not too many meetings because they need to be focusing on what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| But if there's a meeting that needs to be had, if they have an auditorium that seats 300 and they need to put 50 teachers in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| then I think they ought to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| So I would also appreciate relooking at that guidance and trusting our teachers and our principals to be able to make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6725)|
| 1:52:14| for what's best in their building, if they're able to, you know, distance and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| So I would be in favor of that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| So we will, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| I think we have public forum next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Ms. Babb, we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| We have one person on public forum that we'll see if they've been patient enough to go through all these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| Ms. Desiree Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6765)|
| 1:52:56| Is Desiree Dale here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| Hi, just to let you know, if you'll state your name, county of residence, and then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6779)|
| 1:53:07| My name is Desiree Dale and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| And I'm also a teaching assistant in CDCA classroom in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| I'm here today to talk about the role of uniformed officers in our schools and the safety of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| My oldest son has a diagnosis of level two autism, which is defined as requiring substantial support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| He's often seen as a high functioning child with autism, but his level of autism affects his ability to regulate his emotions on his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6808)|
| 1:53:36| He has required a large amount of support throughout his educational years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| On September 4th, just nine short days into his freshman year of high school, an incident occurred that will forever change his course of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6821)|
| 1:53:50| That morning, my son had become agitated in his special education classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| The school administration was called to the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| And this school has a protocol of bringing their KPD officer with them to any administration call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| Within five minutes, the administration left, believing my child was at baseline, even though we know five minutes is not an adequate amount of time for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6843)|
| 1:54:12| After she left, my son quickly became upset again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| He then got to his highest state of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| His fight or flight mode kicked in very quickly, and he picked up a stool and began verbally threatening staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| But at this point, I'm told that the school's KPD officer heard what was happening from the hallway and entered the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| My son has always been fearful of law enforcement, so in his heightened state, seeing the officer only escalated the situation further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| The officer removed the chair from my son's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| My son hit him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| And with his history of aggressive behaviors when he is in crisis, these behaviors are usually handled by a crisis team and would have warranted my son being safely restrained at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6882)|
| 1:54:52| But instead, the KPD officer immediately put my son in handcuffs and told him, you're going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| My 14-year-old child, who was still in crisis, was unable to comply in that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| The officer began to walk my son to the police car, and he went to his knees in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| I've seen the school security footage myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| And when my son went to his knees, the KPD officer proceeded to drag him on his stomach for approximately 15 feet until my son stood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6913)|
| 1:55:22| Once my son stood, the officer held his arms at a very awkward angle in the handcuffs, put him in the back of the police car, and sat for 20 minutes before taking him to the juvenile detention center and charging my son with assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6922)|
| 1:55:36| That was when I received a phone call for the first time that day from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| I was told to meet my son at the juvenile center, and my 14-year-old special needs child sat in a juvenile cell for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| When I emailed Knox County staff for help, the thing I heard over and over again was that, quote, KCS does not oversee the KPD officers that are assigned to individual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6947)|
| 1:55:59| And that, quote, KCS does not have control over when or how a law enforcement officer decides to place a student in handcuffs and or under arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6959)|
| 1:56:08| And I was told that any questions I had should be addressed to KPD only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| But why should an officer step into a special education classroom and police a student during a situation that even the school agrees happened because of behaviors related to his disability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6973)|
| 1:56:24| And how would parents feel knowing that Knox County school employees have no control over how that went and no one stopped it because they were told not to interfere if KPD steps in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6984)|
| 1:56:34| How would other parents of special needs children feel knowing that these officers have little to no training with our children of different abilities, yet have the capability to step into our children's special education classrooms and take over in a crisis situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=6994)|
| 1:56:49| Our school security officers are not even allowed to restrain special needs students in any way, including handcuffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7009)|
| 1:56:56| However, a KPD school officer does not have to go by these same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| A person in uniform who doesn't know our children's most sacred information, their legally binding IEP, can step in and take over in their most vulnerable moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7021)|
| 1:57:11| We can't change what happened on September 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| I had to take a leave of absence from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| I'm helping my family work through therapy, court dates, and trauma and anxiety that our 14-year-old is struggling with daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| But my goal is to see the school board put policies in place so that we never see this happen to another special needs student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| I'm asking the board to revisit the MOA you have with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| Consider changes, including more specific training for the officers, appropriate interactions with all students, and specifically special needs students, and accountability from KCS before law enforcement is allowed to become involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7054)|
| 1:57:48| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| Ms. Dale, thank you for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Okay, and now we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| Do we have anyone who would like to speak for board forum this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| Okay, and we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Did somebody want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| I know I've talked a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| I just want to acknowledge the news that we all got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| Parents everywhere across Knox County are trying to figure out what to do Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| And I also want to thank our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| I know that's no easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201209?start=7096)|
