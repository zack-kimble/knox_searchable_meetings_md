| 0:43:26| them a vital part of the community. The nature of a store being an older store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| is usually going to be a smaller lot and by a smaller lot most of the time you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| have older signage and older pumps and what we like to do is we go in and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| replace the pumps, we replace the roofing and paint it up, but part of that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| lot of those old signs are just a detriment to the to the aesthetic view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| It's you have chipping signs, you're missing little pieces of numbers or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| laying on the ground where the wind has gotten a hold of them. It's just a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| the current signage is just a real old technology and what we would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| is be able to level the playing field. Most of my well almost 100% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| locations I have do not meet the requirement of 250 feet of frontage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| I think that there has been a misunderstanding of the definition of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| EMC because basically this is just an LED sign. This is a new technology of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| sign. It is a static sign and by definition it does not move. All of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| oil companies use this all over the country. They not only use it on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| pricers, they use it on their pylon signs. The shell signs that I put up will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| an LED outline in the pectin will be outlined in LED. All of our bread box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| signs are now backlit with LED. All of our canopy signs are backlit with LED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Now that's just the the most efficient form of lighting this out there now. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| is not an EMC and it does not change. Hopefully those gas prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| don't change that often, but the most it would be would be once a day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| usually that's early in the morning. And I would I would love to move this to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| more reasonable, I don't know what the average frontage is for a convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| store in Knox in the city of Knoxville, but I would say it's a lot less than 250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| feet. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Feld? Oh I'm sorry, Mr. DellaVolpe. I wonder if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:32| could ask that gentleman a question before he before he left. Yes. With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| regard to the the bread box stores, you said you didn't know the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| frontage in Knoxville in general, but what about for your stores? What kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| frontage do you have in terms of feet or average size? They're about between 180| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| and 200 feet of frontage is where we are. We have them, but that's an average. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| mean we have we have one site in Knox and actually in the county that's 250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| feet. That's on Hardin Valley Road and we have sites that are as low as 125 on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| 100 feet. We have a store on Willow Springs Road. We went in and took that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| store over and completely redid that store. I have about 111 feet of frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| on that store. That store does not qualify for electronic price sign and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| actually have to go back and request a special made sign to go back to the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| technology. We have to ask the manufacturer to specially make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| signs now. They don't even make them as a standard offer anymore. The old slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| plastic you know signs. I picture the guy out there with a little suction cup in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| the poles sliding that. If you've ever been in that situation when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| about 10 degrees and I have about 250 employees right here clapping hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| that I possibly get this by because they're out there slapping that trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| to get that thing to stick and a lot of times they fall. We could we get you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| work comp claim. It's just a very dated technology. It's been around for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| 50 or 60 years. You're saying either way you would have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| lighting on the sign. The question is how do you change the figures that are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| price? Exactly. Do you have any special wetted position to whether it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| hundred feet or 150 feet or some other number that this body might choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| I don't but a hundred feet seems to be very fair. I haven't gone back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| looked at what the average you know this is not just for me. I think it you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| needs to be fair for all and I think I don't know if there's any convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| stores out there with less than a hundred feet of frontage. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| know we don't have a single one in the city that would qualify and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| cost of property today I can't afford to buy one just you know 250 feet of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| frontage just to get a electronic price sign. Thank you. Mr. Greve. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| have a question sir. As far as your establishments go you would only use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| this for for gas? Absolutely. And so that what you're really asking for is is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| asking that this be done for gas stations? Not necessarily. That's what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| that's my and you know proposed use. Again it's on all of our signs already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| There's LED all over every sign that's out there today. I mean this this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| something that's new to signs. The only thing that's new is the actual price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| sign itself is in an LED today which is being limped lumped in with EMC's. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| flashing the I mean ours are static. They do not move. That's very important point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| to the. With these signs will you be able to lower the prices of the gas? Absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| what goes up comes down you know that is. Any other questions? I think you can sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| down now safely. Thank you. Miss Feld. Come on down. Please state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| address and you have five minutes. Thank you. My name is Joyce Feld and my address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| is 1540 Aguila Avenue Knoxville Tennessee. In 1947 Don Gunther branded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| the city of Knoxville the ugliest city in America. Deserved or not this insult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| infuriated Knoxvillians. It spurred residents to beautify our city and today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| we have the Dogwood Arts Festival. Well I don't think anyone today would call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| Knoxville the ugliest city in America. The fact is that creating and maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| an attractive city requires progressive thinking, planning, and vigilance. Scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| Knoxville is opposed to reducing the frontage requirements for changeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| price signs from 250 feet to 100 feet. We all benefit daily from advances in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| technology but that doesn't mean we have to embrace all advances. The new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| technology of digital signs threatens the scenic beauty of our city and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| council acknowledged that last year by keeping digital billboards illegal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| banning new electronic message centers. As some of you know only too well there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| were lengthy discussions over several months before the current ordinance was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| adopted in 2009. It was supported by the majority of the people that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| represent. Scenic Knoxville's willingness to support 250 feet of frontage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| changeable price signs was a compromise position. Our preference was and still is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| a ban on all digital signs including changeable price signs. The same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| arguments that applied in 2009 apply now. While convenient for the owners these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| signs are still a garish form of visual blight and the same businesses that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| requested a reduction in frontage are operating without issue and without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| changeable price signs in cities across the country that have banned them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| next door in Farragut where I might add an awful lot of people seem to want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| live. The dust has hardly settled on the new ordinance that everyone worked so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| hard to craft. It should be allowed to stand as written. The request for reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| frontage is an attempt to renew the arms race for bigger, brighter, more obtrusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| signs. Just because the gas station down the street has a changeable price sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| doesn't mean the one up the street has to have one as well. The ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| doesn't stop anyone from advertising their price for gas or putting up new, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| your signs are old, non-digital signs. Going from 250 to 100 feet of frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| is a giant step backward. Before the new ordinance in 2009, council itself imposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| a frontage requirement of 200 feet. Why would you want to dial that back by 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| feet now? Attachment A in your packet is a table provided by MPC on the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| parcels by street frontage on select corridors with office and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| zoning. According to this table, which was not constructed for this purpose, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| is why we can't get an exact number, but a minimum of 1,164| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| parcels would become eligible for a changeable price sign if the frontage was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| decreased to 100 feet. In fact, it would be more than this number because we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| tell how many parcels from the first column have exactly 100 feet and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| table doesn't include all commercial areas in the city. Although to date most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| changeable price signs are used to advertise gas or motel rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| there's no way to legally restrict their use to certain kinds of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| because regulating the content of signs is a violation of freedom of speech. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| means that any one of those more than 1,200 businesses would be able to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| changeable price sign. Any business could choose one signature item to advertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| on a changeable price sign. For example, a market might decide to permanently post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| the price of their milk. If this reduction is passed, it will set a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| dangerous precedent. We predict it will open the door for more requests to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| water down the ordinance. Anyone can come up with a good reason why they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| have a bigger, brighter sign. Scenic Knoxville feels if council is inclined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| to revisit changeable price signs, a better focus would be the size allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| Currently, the maximum allowable size is 25 square feet. This is an awfully large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| sign for what most of the time includes three numbers. One more minute please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| Okay, certainly if the frontage requirements reduced, the size should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| definitely be reduced. Some of you will vote for this because you think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| pro-business, but passing an ordinance which mars the appearance of our city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| not pro-business. Tourists choose the cities they want to visit, and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| people today choose where they want to live, and people want to visit, work, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| live in an attractive city, one that has taken steps to preserve and enhance its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| scenic beauty. Policies that have this as their goal are truly pro-business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| because, simply put, beauty is good for business. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| Thank you. Ms. Grudella-Vopay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Ms. Bell, before you get too far away, would you tell me if there is a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| other than 250 that makes any sense to you, or is your position you'd rather not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| have them at all, and that was a compromise figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Yes. I mean, we worked really hard and came up with 250 as our required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| minimum, and it seems reasonable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| Are there any jurisdictions that you're aware of that have these changeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| price signs that have some controls over what goes on them or differences in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| size or other criteria? In other words, have you looked at this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| regulation elsewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| No, I haven't. I just know that there are numerous communities across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| country that ban them altogether. I'm sure you can get the old-style sign made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| because so many communities don't allow changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| The Farragut doesn't allow them, so they're not all operating with old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| decrepit signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Okay. Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Other comments from Council? Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| I leaned over to my colleague here and said this is almost like déjà vu because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| the older Council members here realize how much time and effort that was spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| on this ordinance. It does trouble me to think that we spend a great deal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| time on any ordinance, and then no sooner do we get it passed that we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| talking about variances and making changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| A couple of things that concern me about this is the fact that all of us need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| understand we're not talking just about gas stations in terms of what could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| on the changeable price signs. So I have a great concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| I think that once we open this up and once we go below what we had already settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| on almost a year ago, that that's the possibility of what could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| I think we've all worked real hard to make sure that we have a beautiful city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| that we've worked hard to see to it that our EMCs are banned and those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| are already here are grandfathered in, but they have some very tight restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| to them. And so I really feel very uncomfortable that this is before us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| terms of trying to make changes at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| I do think that when you look at our neighbors, you look at Farragut, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| not only their gas stations, but their markets and places like that are able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| advertise, and it seems to be okay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| So I think that personally that we should continue to keep what we have and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| Mr. Delverpe, is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Well then, let me come back to you in a second. Let me go to Mr. Becker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| I wanted to, I was one of the folks, as you all know, who was here in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| it seemed like, several year stretch while we debated this previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| While I do see that there's a need, and I think Mr. Bain talked about it nicely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| about how technology can enhance businesses, I think we also have to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| that this is an advantage to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| And I think Ms. Feld was barking up a really interesting tree about saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| if we're going to allow higher technology signs, we should be doing something to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| reduce the amount of signage. She suggested the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| I'd love to look at limiting these to monument signs or wall signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| something that's a little less intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| There's still discussion going on, I see several lights there, but I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| have folks think about, and I'll make a motion soon, about sending this back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| MPC and asking them to look at limits on size and type of signs that are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| if somebody has a price changer sign. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| Let me go to Ms. Roddy, and then we'll come back to Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| I have a question for either engineering or MPC, I'm not sure which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| since Ms. Cash isn't here tonight, I usually ask her those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| Remind me, on the electronic message centers, when we pass those regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| I know that there is a relationship to street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| Is there a minimum street frontage under which a business is not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| to have an electronic message center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| I'll have to look that one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| I'm not positive, but I think it's 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| Also, you might recall that the total sign area is dependent on zone and other factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:58| that I can't quote to you, but I'm sure Anita could if she were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| So there's a lot of factors that go into the size of the sign other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| the one specific ordinance that we're looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| I guess what I'm thinking about is, Ms. Feld talked about leveling the playing field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| and I think in this situation, as Mr. Becker said, the ability to state the price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:30| whether it's for a hotel room or other businesses, is sometimes a great advantage to a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| And we have a situation in Knoxville where our regulations are such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| that we are allowing some to have this advantage and some not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| And in terms of leveling the playing field, it seems like every business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| should have that opportunity, particularly businesses that are going into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| disadvantaged areas, as the speaker talked about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| and making investments in areas that have seen extreme disinvestment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| Improving properties, helping to revitalize neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| which perhaps leverages other investment that we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| through community development and other initiatives in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| So I would like to see this considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| I'd like to see the street frontage lessened and level the playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| so that all the business owners for whom advertising by price is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| can have the opportunity to do that equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| Bill Bope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Yes, the speaker, Mr. Becker, that spoke just recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| raised the point that I wanted to get into, and that was how did we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| How did we get to the 250-foot frontage issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| And I think that's important, and also how did we select the size of these signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| All of us have been to communities like Charlotte| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| and other cities that have a much more rigorous control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| of the outdoor atmosphere around businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| And frankly, a lot of them look better than parts of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| with sign after sign after sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| We're trying to balance healthy businesses against the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| that a healthy community has a certain aesthetic value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| So I guess I'm not sure I'm ready to act on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| I'd like to see a little bit more rational thought being given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| to what is an appropriate size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Should it be on the building frontage, as you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| or a monument sign out by the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| And are there criteria that leave our city with a better-looking atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| while still helping businesses do what they need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| And I certainly am not one to stand here and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| that I think we need men on ladders or waving poles in the wind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| to stick a price sticker on an old-fashioned board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| That doesn't make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| But how we handle our signage, I think, is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| and I'd like to maybe have MPC take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| and see if there isn't an enlightened way to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| that's both fair to businesses and fair to the community that wants to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Not that it needs confirmation, but it is one per 250 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| and you're allowed one EMC per parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| I agree with Mr. Dellivopian, with you, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| in terms of possibly sending this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| But I would like to say that several folks have talked about leveling the playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| One of the best ways to level the playing field is to have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| You know, you can go either way on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| And I think that the beauty of our city, I think, is what's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| and so that's one of the options when you talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| who can have them and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And I think that's what we've done with our EMCs in terms of saying no more EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| So it would be very easy to say no more changeable price signs on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| But I'd be willing to see that this goes back to MPC also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| You know, we went through the long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| and one of the things we talked about was looking again at the overall sign issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| And I'm not sure what we would want to ask the MPC to do exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| I appreciate some of the remarks earlier about advantages and disadvantages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| and maybe I could ask Joyce, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| where Scenic Knoxville is on the overall sign issue and what your plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| And having brought up what's appealing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| and I mean all signs I don't think are very appealing, but they're very necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| And when you look at advantages and disadvantages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| I think the reason that businesses go towards this type of sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| is because they think it's more appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| And the signs he has with the same lights, some of them LED, same visual light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| to me, I don't know what the difference is between the ugly old signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| and what a lot of people think are ugly with the new signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| But I do think you do have an advantage-disadvantage issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| when some have the newer, nicer, cleaner look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| but if you prohibit others that have smaller lots that are in poor areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| disadvantaged areas, you know, it just doesn't really make much sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| But I really wanted to know if we're going to look at sending this back to the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| what would we want to do to cover the overall issue of signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| Well, at one time it was discussed to have a study committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| to look at signage across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| and Scenic Knoxville is very enthusiastic about participating in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| I guess it's been put on hold for now, but we're certainly interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3910)|
| 1:05:19| As far as where we are, while waiting for that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:27| one thing we hope to do is there are a lot of violations of the sign ordinance in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| and so we would like to see better enforcement of the ordinance that already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| I understand that there's a shortage of manpower to handle that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| and that it's complaint-driven, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| we think that the city could be better policed and the ordinance could be better enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| If I could just say one thing about the argument that the digital price signs look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| I'm not sure they look better as much as what they do is they grab your eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| They make you take note of the sign, which is why we think they're a form of visual blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:14| If you allow this to go into effect, what's going to happen eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| maybe not immediately, is you're going to have these 1,200 businesses or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| that are all going to adopt these digital price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Then there's going to be a proliferation, and they're going to stop grabbing your eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| because there's going to be so many, or they're going to grab your eye so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| that you won't be able to tell one from the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| You just reinforce this arms race, and then I think businesses will want something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| in order to stand out from the clutter that already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| That's why I think they want these digital signs, because it makes them stand out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| from the clutter that exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| I just think it's a no-win situation, and it's a dangerous road to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| I see Councilman Pelo in the audience, and I was up here trying to remember exactly where we left this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:10| because the overall issue of EMCs and so forth really took, I think, my attention away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| of some of the smaller things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Not that this is a smaller thing, but I really didn't have the chance to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| and read the minutes and see where we left off at the last council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| I voted to ban the EMCs and to regulate the existing ones for good reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| and the fairness issue was part of that because I thought it would turn into a sign war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| But when it comes to the frontage issue, I think we really do have a fairness issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| and we have an advantage-disadvantage, and it's complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| But if we're going to send this to the MPC, and let me just say this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| When you bring up the study committee, we started the whole sign issue from way back when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:09| looking at the results of a study, and we ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| We did, and then we went on to do a whole completely different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| But I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| I think we do have some fairness issues that need to be addressed now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| and I'm not sure if we can wait for a study committee or even the MPC to come back with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| So I'm going to continue to remain open-minded and see what my colleagues have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| and then I'll speak more or vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| I know we've got Mr. Pavlis, Mr. Brown, Mr. Greve, and then Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| But first, I know Mr. Bain was looking like he wanted to say something a few moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| Let me ask you to please try and be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| I guess today we all have changeable price signs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| Right now the guy goes up there with a suction cup and pulls that little piece of plastic down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| and puts another one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| He can stand up there and do that every five minutes if he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| It is a changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| If the grocery store wants to change and put their milk price up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| every 30 minutes they can go up there with a plastic backlit T-12 bulb from 1962 that we're still using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| and change that face out every 30 minutes if they like to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| I just want to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| These are not anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| It's just a newer technology that we're using that's cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| It's more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| It is a little brighter, but the precedence has already been set because these things are all over town at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| I just want to make sure that we understand that this changeable price sign is not something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| It's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| We're doing it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| I've got a bunch of thoughts that's gone through my head that I've sat here and listened to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:56| I mean, number one, I think when we talk about areas of our city that are depressed or economically depressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4196)|
| 1:10:06| I think that one of the real good ploys that we could come up with is to have better economic development in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:15| And to do that, I think the most intricate part of that is to have a more beautiful city, to make it more business friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:23| It's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| You know, I get the ability to travel a lot in my professional career, and I see cities that have embraced the idea of smaller signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:35| I mean, I don't understand why we want to send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| I mean, I think that's where it's headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| But if we're going to do that, then let's really do something that's going to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| And the difference is we start talking about smaller signs because it's not fair for somebody to have a smaller sign that's lit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:59| than one that's, you know, perhaps up in the air or larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| You know, it just doesn't make any sense to me to send it back to MPC with that charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| I mean, I think you all vetted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| You know, I can remember reading about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| I don't particularly follow it, but through the paper and what have you, but you all had great dialogue and discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:20| So to send it back with, you know, kind of rehash the same thing doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| If we're going to do it, let's do it with something to where we're going to really make an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| and either talk about doing away with them or making them smaller, bring them down to where we don't have all the visual pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:41| I think that's how we help the economics of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| I don't think a digital sign in a challenged area is going to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| But I would ask the gentleman who probably, and I think I'm right on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| but who's got the longest running convenience stores in your industry in this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:08| Well, it would be Bill Weigel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| And how many signs do they have that have electronic messaging on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:20| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| I know they have a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Kingston Pike, I know they have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| I talked to Bill Weigel today and he said they didn't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Well, if you go to the Weigels right in front of Kingston Pike, in front of Home Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| there is a red digital sign right in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| And he has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| I know he has one right there because I pass it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| So he has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Well, his other ones are electronic, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| But they change automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| But they're just not backlit with a different kind of light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| That's the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| He has a different technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| But all of his new stores electronically change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| You stand there with a little button and you push the button and it rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| That's not what he told me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| But anyway, they've been fairly successful, I think, at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| No question whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| And they've done it, I think, kind of the old-fashioned way, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| So, I mean, there's a model out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| And I'm not putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| But, I mean, I think there's other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| And if we're going to do this, if we're going to charge MPC with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| then let's send it back and let's do something that will really make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| not just talk about it, but let's have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| Let's make them smile and bring them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Believe me, if we could take them all down, I'd be 100% happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| I do not want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| I do not want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| But I'm along with when everybody else brings their down, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| And I don't know how we get there by making, you know, grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| I mean, science can be up forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| So, I mean, to say that it's going to bring parity, I just don't think you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| So let's, you know, let's look at it and make a real change if we're going to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| I had a question for Mr. Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| I hate to ask you to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| It's just a small, simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| You're representing Scenic Knoxville, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Yes, I'm the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Other than your organization, are there any other organizations in this community who share your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| or your position on this other than Scenic Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| Well, I think there probably are several, but it's not part of their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| It's part of our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| We're probably the only organization in town whose primary mission is to improve the scenic beauty of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:38| and the county, and we are a local affiliate of the national organization, Scenic America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| and they are the only national organization with that mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Let's go with Ms. Palmer next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| This is for Ms. Feld also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| And this tags along with Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| What is the size of the membership of Scenic Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| We have about 120 members and a lot of friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| Is Scenic Knoxville made up of membership throughout the city of Knoxville, a geographical area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| Throughout the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Okay, and how do you get involved with Scenic Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| Well, come to our events or know us, share our concerns and contact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| I was going to just piggyback to what Councilman Pavlis had to say in terms of I do think we have an opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| to really take a hard look at the changeable price signs, just like we did with the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| I think that it would be easy to charge NPC to say to look at the size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| look at where these particular signs are located if that's one of the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| whether or not it's on the building or whether it's a monument sign or whether it's on a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| I think that they could look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| and I think that, again, they could review in terms of the lot size in terms of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| But I also think that, again, what Councilman Pavlis had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| that you go to a place like Hilton Head and they have signage, but it's all the small signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| It doesn't have anything to do with monument signs and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| And so I think we have an opportunity here to really take a look at these signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| and see how they could be incorporated in the city if that's the direction we want to go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:45| I guess I will go to myself now and try and talk about how we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| I have some interesting points, especially from Mr. Bailey and Mr. Pavlis, about how we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| And what I heard is let's not just send it back to NPC to get it off our plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| but let's really figure out what we want before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| And I think there are a couple options on how we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| Let's deal with this issue, which would be a very specific send it back to NPC idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| And I think, to be honest, I think what we would do is send it back to NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| and ask them to work with law and inspections to come up with some recommendations on a way to reduce signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| or limit where these can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| And even that would be, I think, a fairly complicated process to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| The other option we still have is the infamous study committee, which has been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:45| As I recall this, I don't know if anybody's memory can trump mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| but my recollection is we tabled a resolution creating a study committee to look at using new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| as a way to reduce sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| One option would be to untable that and move forward with something to be a little more comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:06| At this moment, I don't have a strong preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I'd sort of like to hear would folks, and one of the reasons that this study committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| the administration's talked a lot about it, and there's a feeling that it is a big deal to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| It's a lot of complicated items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| I don't know if there's anybody who would like to explore that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| And I'll pause and see if anybody, no lights showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| Oh, Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Please, Mr. Greve, you can say something now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| Oh, I thought you said are you looking for someone that would be interested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| You would, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Let me ask this this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Is there some way we could sponsor a competition by architects or any interested person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| to come up with a kind of desirable signage approach that they could present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| and we would have some kind of an award as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| small monetary award, $5,000 or something like that, but publicize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| You can spend a lot of money chasing rabbits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| but you might have people who have the skill set and the desire to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| and truly use that skill set to be innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| So I'd toss it out for what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| Let me go to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| That's the next one I saw, and then Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Yeah, I think there's a lot of interesting possibilities that are being discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| I think somebody on the other side of the table mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| this is important to remember, maybe it was Mr. Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| that we certainly have the grandfathering issue to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| So any recommendation that we might bring back that we might embrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| in terms of a monument sign on the ground or smaller size numbers or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| would only affect newly permitted signs going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| So anything that's already present in our community stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Well, I was going to say I think it would be good to just go ahead and take a vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:12| rather than going back to MPC, and I would make a motion, if I can, that we could vote on it as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Would that be, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| was that a motion to call the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| I'm not sure if that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| I thought he just wanted to vote on it as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| and I wasn't sure whether his motion was in favor of motion to approve or motion, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:40| My motion is that we vote on the ordinance that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| Without further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| That's a motion to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Can you explain my understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Let me try this as the chair, and it's not debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| So if you're getting ready to debate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| No, I'm getting ready to explain the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| Would I ever debate something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| As my understanding is that given that that was a motion to call the question, we will vote on that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| and if we approve the motion to vote, then we just immediately vote on the ordinance as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| Am I correct about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| And it's a non-debatable motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| We had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| So the motion on the floor is a parliamentary motion to require us to vote, to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:35| Not to vote on the question itself, but just to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Yes, just to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| So all those in favor of voting on item 12F, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| All those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I heard two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Let's do a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4917)|

| 1:22:14| Councilman Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| It was approved five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| There were five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| There were five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| I had four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Let's vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4958)|

| 1:23:00| Five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| So we failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| So we continue debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| I will go to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Vice Mayor, I just am interested in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| I agree with Councilman Brown on a vote, but yet I don't have enough information on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| and I wish Mr. Donaldson or Ms. Cash were here because they have the institutional knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| not that Buzz and Mr. King aren't great knowledgeable individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| but just to go back before this all started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| what the frontage issues were, the minimum required frontage issues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| And also, unfortunately, we have Mr. Bain here who represents one company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| but we really don't have an association made up of collective businesses that this would affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| And I'm not sure if we were to reduce the minimum required street frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| I'm not sure if we were to reduce the minimum required street frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| how many businesses would run and try to take advantage of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| And if we're going to try to do something like bring the signs down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| and I know we have regulations on the sizes of the signs already based on the footage of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:24| but I'm all for grandfathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| I'm all for reducing the sign clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| but I think it's very, very important that we remain pro-business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| and we don't give some businesses, especially in poor, depressed areas, put them at a disadvantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| limit their ability to list their price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| And so it's a tough one and I don't know, here again, if we were to send this to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| Mr. Bain, do you have certain numbers of property you're ready to change the signs on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| I mean, have you been anticipating this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| I'm just kind of trying to get a flavor of, you know, what if we were to pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| Would there be a mad rush of people putting up signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| I don't think so, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| I've had two, since we've had a moratorium on signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| I've had two new signs just because they were just new locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| that I requested the digital price signs that were turned down because they did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| well, one time we didn't have a 250-foot minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| We just had a moratorium on signs, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| And then the second time I did not meet the 250-foot minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| But I don't know of anybody else who's attempting to put them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| other than growth in Knoxville as, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| And maybe I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| How many do you anticipate putting up, or did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| I have one on Washington Pike today that I'm building a brand new unit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| that I have 193 feet of frontage that's a $2.5 million site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| that I would love to have a modern price sign up just because my competition has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| And what's your timing on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| What's the timing on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| When do you anticipate opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| May 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| I'm going to – I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| And let me do that first, Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| I'm going to move that we refer this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| and ask them to work with permitting and law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| and I think it's important to involve them in zoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| to explore ways to look at reducing the street frontage significantly from the current 250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:52| but also look at ways to reduce sign clutter through smaller size signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| or the elimination of pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| And now Mr. DellaVolpe and then Ms. Roddy and Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| I just wanted to follow up on the thought that was on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| and that was if a gentleman has at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| and this is for Mr. Johnson, I guess, or for MPC, has less than 250 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| is his route to get some kind of a variance on the sign ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| What does one do when they want to apply for a sign during the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| say you were studying this for a month or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| What do they do in the meantime in terms of applying for permission to deal with their particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:43| that may be under the 250-foot limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| The two members, the two lawyers here may say or may correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| but I would think you'd have, first of all, you'd have to show hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| Now, as to what that hardship is, that, you know, I can't say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| but I don't know that that's a variable item to begin with, but I'd have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| I think I see two heads going side to side, which would mean they wouldn't be variable items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| I think we agree that they are not variable items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| That translates into that that person could not qualify for getting a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| or a variance on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Is that a fair interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| That's all I wanted to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| While I like the idea of the motion to postpone to allow some study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| I'm realistic about the amount of time that that takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| Mr. DelaVolpe said in a month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| The reality is, you know, this may be six months or more before it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| The NBC's plate is very full, and their funding is limited for studies of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| And along the lines of Councilman Bailey's comments, you know, in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| we have businesses that are making significant investment in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| and are locked out of fair playing field, fair competition with their competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:15| I don't know parliamentarily, Mr. Swanson, since we have a motion to postpone on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| I'll go ahead and say what I'm thinking, and you can tell me I'm not allowed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Actually, I don't think we have a motion to postpone on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| I think we have a motion to refer it back to NBC on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| Well, then, if this is a proper motion within that context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| I'd like to propose an amendment to the original motion, a compromise amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| to vote on tonight to allow the interim, which could be six months or longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| to allow businesses to have fair competition with the long-term objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| of perhaps going to a more aesthetically pleasing sign type in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| a monument sign or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| I think as we saw the councils, you know, before us on whose shoulders we stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| and they took a very courageous stand on billboards, and they banned billboards on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| We still have billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| But, you know, attrition being what it is, slowly we're getting toward that objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| So I guess I feel strongly about businesses that are making an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| that are locked out of fairly competing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| But the amendment that I would like to offer as a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| is to allow these changeable price signs on properties that have 150 feet or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:38| rather than 100 that's proposed in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| which would, according to the table that we have on page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| encompass 89% of the parcels along the four major corridors that were studied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:52| Kingston Pike, Cumberland Avenue, Magnolia Avenue, and Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| You see the percent of parcels on the right side of that column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| And I believe, if I've done my math correctly, that would encompass 89% of the parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| and would sweep in the majority of the ones on those four corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| granted, that are locked out at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Are you saying limit it to those four corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| No, no. I'm saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| You're saying approve changing it to 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| 150 feet. Yes, approve this motion. Send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| This would be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Substitute motion to amend the original ordinance to 150 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| but I also support referring the whole issue back to MPC for study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| So we're passing something but also then studying further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Well, the proper motion for what I think you want to do is to amend it to from 100 feet to 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:54| And then council can initiate the process of MPC doing studies and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5514)|
| 1:32:01| I think you want to, by separate action, initiate some other study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| that you may have in mind with regard to this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| But I think an appropriate motion would include only amending the current proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| from 100 feet of frontage to 150 feet of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| And can we initiate a request for that study tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| or does that require a new resolution on a new agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| Generally, you have been able to do that by saying so at the council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| by sending them a letter, or by doing a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| It doesn't matter which of those three you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Typically, MPC pays attention because their budget kind of runs through you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| And so typically, MPC has not ignored those kinds of requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| but you could do it in any of those three ways, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| And I stand subject to being corrected by Buzz if I'm incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| We listen. We listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Then I would like to make a motion to amend from 100 to 150 feet as the minimum in the ordinances in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:09| Let me hold this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| A substitute motion that parliamentary would take precedence over mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| So was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Mr. DellaVoppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| I guess I'm concerned by Ms. Roddy's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| In the name of fairness, we're going to open a race to the door to get your sign in before any new regulation comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| And I'm reminded of my old high school science class when you put those little microbes on the Petri dish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:43| and they kind of all race to get some turf until they all die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| And I think that that's the wrong way to go about this because if we're going to control signs in a way that both helps business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:55| and helps the community by adopting some different aesthetic value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| whether that be size, appearance, monument on the building or some other approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| it seems to me that we need to do that because I think Mr. Swanson is going to tell us if we approve others in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| they're going to be grandfathered in and we're going to guarantee that we have more signs that we really don't want if we change the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| And in the name of fairness, we're going to really hurt ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| I'm all for fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| I'm all for fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| I think we ought to do it by having a new standard and everyone play by that rule going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| Mr. Greave and then Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| Mr. Mayor, I agree with Councilman Della Vopi, but I also want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| I want to address what Ms. Roddy said that, you know, the councils before us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| They took courageous stance and they banned billboards in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| And that was a courageous stance on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| And then the last council, again, took a courageous stance and banned EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| And at the same time when they did this, they also had, thinking about the changeable price sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| said that someone can have a changeable price sign if you have 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| And so I think that, if anything, that we ought to stand with the former council folks who did take a stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:16| I would also be in total agreement in terms of sending this to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| and having them take a look at how signs could be done in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| that really helped to clean up the clutter in our whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| I think that's what all of us are looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| is that we want to continue to see that Knoxville stays a green city and it stays a beautiful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| And I think we have the opportunity to do that, but let's not lessen what we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| but let's do take a review and check and see what has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Mr. Kravlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Well, and it was brought up, I mean, when I was on council before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| I was part of that council that, you know, that did take the stand to ban them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| But I still look around town and, you know, is there improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Is it where it should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| But you all, I mean, the senior members of this council, you know, vetted this, you discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:11| and, you know, you came up with 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| And then if we're going to do a study, it just, I mean, with all due respect to Councilman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| it doesn't, I just can't go along with lessening it, you know, what has been discussed to death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:29| but then change it again while we're going to study it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| So, I mean, to me, that just, I don't find the logic in that, and I just, I can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| So if we're going to send it back, and I think that's where it's headed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| I would hope that we would keep it at where it was at least until there's a process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:50| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Yeah, Councilman Pavlis, that's what I was trying to say earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| is I'm up here trying to rack my brain on what led us to this 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5815)|
| 1:37:02| And the only thing I can remember is that came up and we were talking originally about EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| And I think the reason that this was left the way it was is because it was done, it was oversight and confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:16| And there's been several things since then that have come out that we just really overlooked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| that in the original discussions, that's not really the way I thought the body felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:30| But yet, you know, in trying to pass the overall EMC and digital billboard issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| some of these things were just left that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| And I do think, here again, there's a serious fairness issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| and we have to look at people that are investing in our cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| especially in our, you know, some of the neighborhoods and some of the areas that need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| And if I could make, wave a magic wand tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| we would have something already in place that says we'll have ground signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| we'll have height restrictions, we'll have size restrictions, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| So I think back in October when we originally asked for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| MPC, it's here now, and the intent was to correct some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| And I don't think we're going to have a bum rush for people to put up signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| and I think this is what Councilman Roddy's put forward is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| It takes care of, I think, half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| Mr. Bain, what's the size of your frontage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| 193 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| And so, I mean, these aren't easy, but I don't think we're going to create havoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| And so I'm going to continue to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| But I did want to say I think that's why it was left the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| Mr. Chair, if I could, if you don't mind me kind of barging in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| just a couple of observations and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| In terms of what appears to be a focus issue is the fact that we've got a lot of lots in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:13| that are going to be less than 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| And, you know, there is something to be said for, quote, unquote, fairness issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| That's not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| I think we're still going to have a situation where we have X number of lots that fall under the 250 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:31| and would not have the ability to apply for one of these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| In looking at what we've presented, we still have some, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| we still have some tight requirements, even if you go down to 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| There's still some tight requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Going to LED technology and being and chairing and staffing the Technology Corridor Development Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| we have started and we have received advice from lighting consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| And all you read nowadays is LED technology is the wave of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| And there are a lot of reasons it is and has a lot of advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| I'm not so sure it's always brighter than what you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| I know that we have found, we're finding in just regular advertising signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| the LED lighting tends to be less obtrusive, less, I don't know if that's the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| but less abrasive to the eye, more visually appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| It is also more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| And there are a lot of things that speak well to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| So I think based on, and I'm not trying to pull a last minute play here to get you to pass what MPCs approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:43| but I want to make sure I got those observations out there because I think a lot of things are going to still be with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| regardless of how much more study we do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| As I say, I think there's still a lot in the ordinance that makes this a lot tighter than what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| Having said all of that, if you do choose to send it back, please be very clear as to what we are to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:09| I'm hearing some comments about, well, MPC needs to take a look about how to reduce sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| That can be a two-month study or that can be a two-year study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| Please be very clear as to what we are to do and be as specific as you can so that we can get to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:31| We have a focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| We can get to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| We can come back with some more recommendation because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| we want to spend the amount of time that's needed, but we also don't want to let this thing drag out to where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:46| it's going to take us four or five months to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| We need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| If that's what you choose to do, we need something that gives us some very specific focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Let me come back to myself in a second to deal with that since I'm the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| Let me go to Ms. Roddy now and then Mr. Woodhull and then myself and then Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| Councilwoman Pilo and I served on the original Electronic Message Center Study Committee quite a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:17| I think it started in 2004 perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| And my recollection, I concur with Councilman Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| my recollection is the study committee and the original legislation that came forward to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| dealt exclusively with electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| And it was, I believe, at the recommendation of Mrs. Cash, she's not with us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| who realized, and I see Mr. King nodding, that the changeable price signs were also a lit sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| They were also a form of an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| And so at some point in all the convoluted process of amending and going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| the changeable price sign language was added perhaps by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| so that we were addressing all types of electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| And my recollection is there was not a significant amount of discussion or study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| about the specific needs of changeable price signs as differed from electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:14| In other words, they were just kind of swept in on the tide of the regulation of EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| I do think that there are significant differences that need to be taken into account in our center city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:29| I know in some of our residential zoning discussions in Vice Mayor Becker's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| some of the areas that he represents, when you have a 150-foot residential lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| that brings significant issues that have to be addressed differently from larger, more suburban lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:45| And I think we want to continue to have businesses that can invest in center city properties that are smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:55| And as Mr. Johnson said, that street frontage isn't going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| That part's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| And changeable price signs already exist on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| It's just that they are forced to use the technology with less energy-efficient bulbs that light up the whole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| If you can picture them, you know, the message boards where you slide in the letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| and we've got candy bars on sale this week or whatever, and the whole sign is lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| If you talk about ambient light into a neighborhood or into a roadway, I'm not an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| but to my estimation, that's more obtrusive than simply an LED number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| not to mention the carbon footprint that you're putting out with the larger signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| and the old-fashioned incandescent bulbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| So I continue to support the motion that I made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| I'd like to see a compromise position to give some more parity to our businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| that are investing in these smaller lots that need redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| but then at the same time look at our greater vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| And as Mr. Johnson said, I think our greater vision needs to be defined tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| but I think that's going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| I really resonate with many of the comments of Councilman Pavlis about building a beautiful city and a well-designed city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:23| And also I know that we have taken a lot of time over the past several few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:35| to take some courageous steps in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| and there are going to be some inequities that will be produced in that transition, in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| I actually, and the business community is very adaptable and creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| and I think that the level playing field will occur even in inner city neighborhoods around a more beautiful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:58| I see establishments in my neighborhood in Mechanicsville operating well without the use of the signs that we're discussing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:10| So I don't favor a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| I favor sending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| In your mind, Vice Mayor Becker, what is the difference between sending it to MPC and having a study committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:32| I'd be curious to know what your thoughts are around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| You sort of proposed it earlier, so what are you thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| I was going to call on myself to actually deal with that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| Can I call on you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| It's always a challenge when I'm part of the discussion and also chairing it, so I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| And I was actually thinking in the context of what Mr. Johnson asked about, how much do you want MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| Do we want MPC to look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| At some level, I think there is a big picture question, how are we going to reduce sign clutter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| That's sort of the resolution creating the study committee that we could untable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| And that's a big picture item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| That's probably a year or more study, a lot of involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| What I would picture with what we're doing here in sending it to MPC is something very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:23| And I know we ask MPC to consider things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| As the maker, I would think that I would like MPC to come back with something that would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| price changer signs are allowed at 100 feet of street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| I could even see it being a little less or even significantly less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| If they are, say, half the normal square footage or a monument sign or something like that, it's a very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:50| We're getting smaller signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| We're getting less obtrusive signs, but we're having more technically advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| And I think the difference between that and the study committee is that's a very specific just for price changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| The study committee, I think, is a much larger, I'm sorry, just price changer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| So the study committee would study what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| I think, given it's a study committee, it would study everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| Toward what end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| I think the task that it was written up as is how to look at new technologies as a way to reduce sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:28| the visual pollution of signs or sign clutter or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| And that's a big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| And it's kind of a medium size, which could be a deeper look at price changer signs or EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| But I think if we're going to delve deeply into this, it makes sense to look at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| So if we were sending it to MPC, we would be giving them the, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| the specific mandate to reduce clutter in the context of fairness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| No, I think sending it to MPC, not the study committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| I think the sending it to MPC is a very specific change in language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| Take what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| And instead of, let me pull this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:13| The language we have that would say changeable price sign shall be limited to parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:24| with a minimum of 100 feet of frontage on the street where the property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| It would be changeable price signs shall be limited to parcels with a minimum of 150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| whatever, on the street where the property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| If these signs are, you know, half the square footage of total signage or monument signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| something very limited like that, only for price changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Mr. Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| If you read what MPC has already sent to us in terms of regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| that basically what you're asking, I think, Vice Mayor, is that really a compromise on the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:18| as far as the feet frontage and then also really the size of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| If you read in terms of what they're requiring, you know, the changeable price sign to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| I sort of question, you know, where you're kind of headed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| But I think the thing that worries me most about this is that I think we're forgetting about the greater vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:39| and the greater vision of what we want our city to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| And I think that, again, I go back to the fact that, you know, we ban billboards, we ban EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| and I think we have a situation here where there was a lot of work done to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| And whether or not we're talking about technology or fairness of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| I think the thing that we really should be charged with is that greater vision of what we want our city to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| and the beauty of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| And I think we're all pretty well versed in the fact of what signs do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| and the clutter and the clutter that we have in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| And we have an opportunity to move forward and to take another bold step, which several councils behind us have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| And one of the things that makes for a better city and a beautiful city is the elimination of clutter of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| And so I think that that's the other thing that we should keep in mind is that what is the vision that we want this city to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Let me go to Ms. Palmer and then Mr. Dellivope and Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| We've spent a lot of time talking about a study committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| MPC has asked for some real specific direction because very likely this ordinance that came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| was based on a previous request to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| What if we decided to have a study committee come up with some specific things we want MPC to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| before we ask them to do anything so that it's really clear and that we have the time as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:11| to hash this out, brainstorm, come up with what it is we want them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| and then at that point ask real specific things from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:24| Let me go to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| I guess I concur with Councilman Grief that we do need to keep our eye on the vision of what we want our city to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| However, as Mr. Bain pointed out earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| tangible price signs that are not digital in nature, that do not have the LED lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:48| that are backlit are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| I mean, they're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| And so businesses that are investing in properties that are below 250 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| are going to need to continue to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| And so what's going to happen is, are we creating more signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| Well, yeah, there's new signs that are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| They're just going to be the old technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| Now, is that more attractive in terms of beautifying our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| Is that more energy efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Is that the route we want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| I guess I would rather see this motion amended tonight and bring down that minimum requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:30| so that new investment is at least more energy efficient and cleaner and more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| and then go forward with a very specific request to MPC in terms of studying the tangible price signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| because I think the tangible price signs as a category were not scrutinized in the way that electronic message centers were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6824)|
| 1:53:51| when the four of us that are still on council were part of this extended debate previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:58| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| I definitely like when Councilman Roddy says things about cleaner and more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| But I also think it's fair to say that we actually don't have a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| I mean, technically, we don't have a bullseye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| But many of our actions are implying a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| And so that's why it feels a little confusing to study or to send it to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| when our vision is still somewhat implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| I think Ms. Palmer actually had a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| that idea that we ought to talk about what we want before we send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| When I was reading this, I noticed Buzz Johnson writing it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| and I thought, well, he's got what I want, but what do the other eight people want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| And I guess, Ms. Palmer, I guess what you're suggesting is that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| that the nine of us sit down somehow and figure out what we actually want to do with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| sort of absent the idea of what's the motion on the floor and be a little more free thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:06| So I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Yes, I think we've almost talked this thing to death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| and I like the discussion of vision and of some concrete direction that we can come up with as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:20| I just want to say I've been looking at the zoning regulations, and maybe I'm misinterpreting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| but it talks about 40-watt incandescent lights and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| and I don't see a single word about LEDs and energy efficiency and all of that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| And I think that's part of what we have to get on paper and send to MPC to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| I think, I mean, they measure light rays in nits, whatever they are, God help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| And, you know, you can have so many in the day and so many at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| but it doesn't say LEDs anywhere in this regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| So I think it's important to get it straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Let's sit down and spend the time we need to get MPC to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| and set ourselves short but reasonable deadlines to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| Let's just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| Let me, as a chair, Ms. Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| I think since I said you had a great idea, how do you think we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| What's the step to do what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| Because I like your idea, and I'm not quite sure how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| Perhaps some independent brainstorming and then bringing the independent ideas together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| and see what kind of overlap we have, where we're very far apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| and I think figuring out what the vision really is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| because my vision of a beautiful Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| and Councilman Woodall's vision of a beautiful Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| and Councilman Grieve's might be 100% alike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| or they might be so opposite that we need to figure out some compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| So I would suggest that we do some independent brainstorming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| and then bring that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part1?start=7012)|
