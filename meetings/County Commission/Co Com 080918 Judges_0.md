| 0:00:00| analysis for the Knox County General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| charges and criminal court cases and that was prepared and submitted in July of 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4)|
| 0:00:08| The conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| reached by that time study was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| we needed to do a much better job in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| administering the cases that come before General Sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=20)|
| 0:00:24| We need to do a much better job. The time spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| through working the cases through the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| doesn't come close to meeting any of the national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=36)|
| 0:00:40| That study was followed by another study which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| was a business review of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=44)|
| 0:00:48| process of the General Sessions and criminal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| clerk's offices. Very extensive study. It was cited in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| later study, one that I talk about in my letter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| The main study that was performed was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| initial jail crowding assessment. Within that assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| dozens of recommendations made by the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| in the field who found that one, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| granting too many continuances that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| courts were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| basically following their own local rule, local rule four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| in allowing continuances which puts a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| amount of stress on our entire justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| The criminal process starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| with an arrest but it's quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| in the hands of the courts and then the administration of the court is so very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| important and it's so very important for us here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| because we're under a federal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| under the federal court's watchful eye and have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| since 1986. I was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| in the Carver case that led to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| cap on our jail that's within this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| where we house the most violent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| persons who have been accused of crimes or are serving sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| We have to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| now a monthly report to the federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| Within that report we have to advise the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| on what, are we meeting our goals and objectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| The goals and objectives that have been addressed by this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| and I've included four or five pages behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| the letter that I've given you from this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| which includes a number of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| some of which we really need to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| We need to have a morning docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| We need to have an afternoon docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| We really ought to have a night court to make our courts accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| to the public, accessible to me and you, accessible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| our relatives and our friends and the other persons in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| County who work during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| We really ought to do those things and it's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| someone who stands here before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| and I encourage you to, whoever it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| you determine should be the next General Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| judge in Knox County, I encourage you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| impose upon me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| or any person else that stands before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| that they will do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| These are not John Owings ideas. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| recommendations from the experts, the people that deal with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| and have for years and years and years and through hundreds and hundreds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| municipalities and counties and they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| they know what it takes to run an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| effective justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| I would encourage you to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| if you do nothing else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| get a commitment from those who stand before you that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| will take these and I'll wrap up, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| take these recommendations very seriously. I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| And that they can be a catalyst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| for improving our justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| It's not broken but it can run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| a whole heck of a lot better and if you will read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| the study and I'm sure that our administration can provide you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| with complete copies of the studies, there was another study that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| and the study that I'm speaking of, the one where they made a number of recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| it was just completed last year, last July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| and we really haven't taken any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| no one's really taken the lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| on making sure that these recommendations get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| implemented and I'm willing to do that and I'm committed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| Yes, sir. Are there any questions? Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Mr. Chairman, you talked about continuances. Do you feel that having an afternoon court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| and a night court would help with the number of continuances by just having more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| to devote to these? Absolutely and it's not just John's feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| It's the feeling of the experts and I believe that there's a discussion of that within those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| materials that I just passed out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| What happens, you get all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| these folks in court and they'll work through lunch and it's not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| just addressing continuances but it's making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| the court, you know, we should be all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| about improving the image of our courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| and I'm not so sure that our court system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| has a stellar image and it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| improved. It's discussed in the reports and as I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| whoever stands before you needs to commit, I believe, needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| commit to implementing these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| Continuances, we have a local rule that applies to continuances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| and there needs to be a good reason for a continuance and the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| were criticized through the experts. My other question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| is, and if you would give me a brief response to this, is that in Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| Court, it's my understanding they deal not only with the civil aspect but the criminal aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| That's right. You also deal with mental health commitments. There's an aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| of landlord-tenant types of things. So could you just briefly touch on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| your qualifications for hearing these because for many of our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| the only way, the only court they're going to ever appear before, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| hopefully they never do, but if they do, this is the court. So would you address that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| My experience over the last 20 years, Commissioner, has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| in not only being a law clerk at federal court but in representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| the interest of Knox County. The interest of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| touches on a few of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| not as much as someone who is engaged in the full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| practice of criminal law, but we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| encounter those situations on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| So my experience in those have just been through the Knox County Law Director's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| and it's somewhat limited as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| commitments go and as far as DUI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| enforcement certainly. We're not involved in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Commissioner Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| John, I like your ideas about night court. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| we've had those discussions in the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| What about waiving fees and incident people that appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| before the courts? I think we all want people to certainly have a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| to due process, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| we have seen in recent years that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| evidently fees are being waived through the courts by the judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| judges. Would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| I don't know how you make a pledge not to waive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| fees, but could you tell us how you declare someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| injured? Certainly no one that can come before you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| is an attorney should be telling you that they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| going to waive fees. We should not engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| in that type of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| with persons. We have to be, a judge has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| to be impartial. A judge has to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| Waiving fees is within the sound discretion of the trial court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| Waiving fees has become an issue. It's not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| been tracked. We haven't really had the software to track it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| until the last couple of months and now that information is being entered into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| Obviously, Knox County needs more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| revenue. We have a number of programs that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| talked about through the Criminal Justice Committee, which I've been involved in since its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| inception, that need to be implemented and we need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| fees for that. So those are all things that are within the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| of the court, but it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| closely monitored, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Seeing none, thank you, John. Thank you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| Dale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Holley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=608)|
| 0:10:18| I thank you for this opportunity to address you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| briefly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| When I began telling people who were friends of mine that I was interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| applying for this appointment, the question that most frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| came was, why in the world would you want to be a General Sessions Court judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| And as I considered that question and the way that I answered it, I discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| that it was a lot easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| to come up with things that I think are the wrong reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| for wanting to be a Sessions Court judge, and it was a much more difficult question to answer than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| I had originally anticipated it would be. But as I thought about how I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| might answer that question, what came to my mind was to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| what are those characteristics that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| I were seeking to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| and appoint someone to fill the position of Sessions judge, what are the characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| that would be important to being an effective General Sessions Court judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| And then how does my own experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| my own talents, contribute to fulfilling those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| characteristics? First of all, I think that a General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Court judge must understand that he or she operates as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| part of a team. There are five General Sessions Court judges, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| as much as a person might want to be a Lone Ranger in that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| one must acknowledge that it is important to work as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| of that total team. And as I reflect on my own experience, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| say with a great deal of certainty that I have experience working as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| of a team and as leading part of a team. If you note on my resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| you'll see that in 14 years in the district attorney's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| almost 10 of those years were spent as the supervising attorney for our General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| Court team. That was 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| of daily contact with persons who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| come into contact with the General Sessions Court. The judges, the clerk's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| office, citizens who come into court, defense attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and prosecutors. Also during my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| working with the Sessions Court unit, I was the senior attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| in our office's warrant screening division. That gave me an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| opportunity to work closely with the judicial commissioners. And of course, part of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| General Sessions Court judges do is to supervise the work of the judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| I'm familiar with the work that they do. I have relationships with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| the judicial commissioners and feel that I would be effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| in assisting to coordinate their responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Another characteristic that I think the Sessions Court judge has to have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| the judge has to understand that the work of the Sessions Court does not stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| alone within the criminal justice system or the justice system as a total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| That the work of the Sessions Court has an impact on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| those other courts. And for that reason, efficiency within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| General Sessions Court is important. As Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Owings has pointed out, it's important to pay attention to what the experts have said about ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| that we might improve the efficiencies of our dockets. Having been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| on a criminal court trial team for the last four years, I can speak with first-hand experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| as to the impact that the Sessions Court and the decisions of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| Sessions Court can have on proceedings in criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| And that's true on the civil side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| It's important for a Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Court judge to take the time that's necessary to fully consider the legal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| that are presented and to render decisions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| as correct as they can be within the bounds of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| Because coupling the role of the General Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| as an inferior court with rushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| decisions and making bad decisions will result in more work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| the trial court level courts. I also think a General Sessions Court judge has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| to be flexible in carrying out his or her responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| The size and the composition of the dockets in the General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| Sessions Courts vary from day to day. And it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| for persons who would seek to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| preside over those courts to understand the importance of being flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| on a day-to-day basis and preparing himself or herself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| to address those issues that come up frequently at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| And I'll say that my experience in the DA's office has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| a lesson in learning to be flexible. Most days I come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| into the office with my list of things that I'm prepared to do and anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| doing during the day. And most days, when the end of the day comes, I find that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| have spent a lot of time dealing with issues that walk through the door, came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| that very morning. Finally, I think a General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Court judge must have a knowledge of the law and must have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| ability to communicate the law. And I believe if you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| look on my resume at the experience that I have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| leading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| sessions that relate to explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| of, interpretation of, and communication of the law, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| teaching recruits at the KPD Academy, participating in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| seminars and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| gatherings where the legal system and legal issues were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| addressed. I believe not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| does the fact that I've done those things point to evidence that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| the ability to do it, but also the fact that many of those seminars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| that I participated in, I've been invited to do so because there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| a feeling on the part of the people putting the seminars together that I had a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| ability to communicate an understanding of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| That is a vital part of the role of the General Sessions Court judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| It's important to remember that the Sessions Court judge comes into contact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| many regular, normal citizens on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| And those citizens deserve, as they leave the courtroom, to leave with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| understanding of what has happened, even if they don't agree with what the judge has done, at least to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| with an understanding of how the judge came to that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| I believe that the American system of justice is the greatest system in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I've committed my life and my career over the last 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| to the improvement of that system, and I appreciate the opportunity to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| for a leadership role in continuing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Commissioner Hammond. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to go back to something that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Owings had talked about, and I'm quite interested because I served on an efficiency panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| a few years ago, and one of the recommendations was that we look at an afternoon or a night court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| That recommendation really didn't get anywhere. Now we have a recommendation from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| the experts who say something needs to be done with this caseload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Would you address your feelings on establishing afternoon court? Because it is not a popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| thing among the current judicial structure to do an afternoon or a night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| court, but I would be interested in your thoughts. It's true that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| it's not been a popular topic when it's been brought up before. I think there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| of benefit to considering the establishment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| what you might think of as a staggered docket. The primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| benefit that I see to that is, particularly on the criminal side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| a Sessions Court judge spends 80% of his or her time dealing with criminal dockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| And on the criminal side, you have law enforcement officers that are being subpoenaed into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| court, you have citizens that are being subpoenaed into court, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| business people, merchant representatives that are being subpoenaed into court. They're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| subpoenaed to come in at 9 o'clock. And you may come in at 9 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| and sit around waiting through the docket and it may be up into the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| when your case is heard. It makes sense to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| that we would have a system of dockets that would allow us to say to a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| you need to be here at 9 or you need to be here at 10 or you need to be here at 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| or you need to be here at 2. And to structure those dockets in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| that there is more certainty to what cases will be heard at what time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| and as a result of that, there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| less imposition on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| time requirements of those citizens who have been subpoenaed to come into court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Would you also address for me a little bit about your experience? I know that some of the people that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| talked with on the phone or who have submitted their resumes have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| sat on the bench. They've actually had to render a judgment. Would you tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| any of your experience in that area? I have never sat as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| substitute judge in General Sessions Court and the reason for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| is that during the time that I would have been eligible in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| of age to do that, I've been employed in the District Attorney's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| We could not sit as a substitute judge in General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Court because we would have a conflict on every single case on that docket if we were sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| on one of the criminal dockets. So I can't point to the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| experience of sitting as a substitute judge as something that I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| Commissioner Lutho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Mr. Hawley, tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| you don't need to mention names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| but what within your experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| separates you from the rest of these candidates because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| they're all, I find every one of these candidates, very good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| So what do you feel in your background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| separates you and why we should nominate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| and appoint you as judge? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| the chief strength that I would point to in terms of my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| would be my experience working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| as the supervisor of the Sessions Unit in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| District Attorney's Office. I believe that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| significant that in that role, on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| I was in court, working a docket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| or consulting with the clerk's office, or consulting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| citizens who were attempting to swear out warrants, or consulting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| officers and investigators who were attempting to secure process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| working on the policy issues that surround the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| General Sessions Court, working with the judges, assisting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| in the development of forms that were being used in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Those are all the kinds of things that I did on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| in that role. And I just believe that that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| of regular and daily contact with the General Sessions Court is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| the significant strength that I would bring to this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| Commissioner Norman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hawley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| I noticed in your resume there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| you have a definite emphasis in community activities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| professional training towards helping senior adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Would you speak to that just for a moment? Sure. I became involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| a group in 1995, I guess the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| end of 95, early 96, that was known at the time as the East Tennessee Elder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Abuse Coalition. That was a group that had grown out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| changes in the adult abuse, vulnerable adult protection laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| in the early 1990s. And my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| work with that group grew into something of a passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| for assisting in the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| of the elderly and vulnerable adult population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| significant need for community education about the issues surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| elder abuse and vulnerable adult abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| As a result of that involvement and activity, I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| chair of the East Tennessee Elder Watch Coalition, which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| successor agency to the Elder Abuse Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| I've also, for the last about a year and a half, been working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| a group that is forming on the state level, the Tennessee Vulnerable Adult Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| That's an outgrowth of regional elder abuse coalitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| coming together at the state level and advocating for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| not only for legislative change to help assist in the protection of older adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| but also the issue of community awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| If we don't understand anything else about elder abuse and vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| adult abuse, we understand that a key component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| to reducing the problem is making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| members of the general community are aware of what the legal requirements are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| in terms of mandatory reporting and that they're aware of where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| can turn for assistance and help when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| an event of elder abuse occurs in their family or in the family of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| friend. It really is a passion that I've developed over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| last few years, and I think it's clear from looking at my resume that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| a lot of the work that I've done in the DA's office and in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| has to do with the issue of elder abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Along the same lines of what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Tony said, I'm a firm believer in working in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| and having a good feel for what's in the community rather than just be off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| in your own little world somewhere. So I think that you can relate with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| You mentioned about the General Sessions Court that you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| I'm seeing the resume here from 94 to 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| So that's when you were mainly in there from 94 to 95, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Well, I came to work in the DA's office in July of 1994. My first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| assignment in the DA's office was working in what was at the time the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| County Division of General Sessions Court. After the court reorganization in 95, it became the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Misdemeanor Division of General Sessions Court. In the summer of 96,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| I went over to juvenile court on a grant that we had received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| to prosecute juvenile offenders and gang members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| In December of that year, General Nichols called and asked me if I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| come back to our office downtown and supervise the General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Unit. So my responsibility when I came back in December of 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| shifted from going to misdemeanor court every day to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| the administrator in charge of the Sessions Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| So from December of 95 until September of 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| I served as the supervisor for the Sessions Unit. That involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| overseeing the attorneys and support staff that worked in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| It involved working dockets when that was necessary if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| somebody was out or if there was a large docket and somebody needed assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| then I would go down and work with the dockets. It involved working with the judges, working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| the clerk's office, working with the judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Since September of 2004, you've mainly been in criminal court, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Since September of 2004, I've been a member of the Division I trial team in Knox County Criminal Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| There have been occasions that have taken me back to General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| We deal with things in criminal court that are often affected by new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| charges being incurred at the Sessions Court level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| In a month's time, how many times would you be, or in a year's time, how much would you spend in General Sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| As a member of a criminal court trial team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Just as an attorney being in front of a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| Well, as assigned to the General Sessions Court Unit, it would be a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| As a member of the criminal court trial team, I'd say four or five times a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| I have to go back down to General Sessions Court. And to be quite frank, when I go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| down to General Sessions Court at this point, it's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| to work an entire docket as much as it may be to go in on a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| defendant or a particular group of defendants that have cases pending in Division I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you. Commissioner Andrews. Mr. Hawley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| prior to coming into the district attorney's office, you worked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| another law firm. Did you have any civil, the reason I'm asking, do you have any civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| experience for the Fifth Sessions rotation? I did, and thank you for asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| It's been a number of years since I was engaged in private practice, but when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| in private practice, the focus of my practice was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| general commercial litigation and collections work. And in fact, when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| came into the district attorney's office in 1994, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| assignments that I had was to assist with the collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| of delinquent court costs. Our office at the time had a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| with Lillian Bean, who was the clerk of the court, to assist in the collection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| delinquent court costs. And so part of what I did initially was to advise the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| on establishing a collection program to assist with that. So I do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| experience. When I was in private practice, I had occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| to appear in the Civil Division General Sessions Court, handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| primarily those collection matters. We have, in the DA's office, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| very limited role on that civil docket. You may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| aware that we have a handgun carry permit law in the state of Tennessee, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| if a person's carry permit is denied, revoked, or suspended by the Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Safety, if they file an appeal to General Sessions Court, by statute, the DA's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| office represents the state in those proceedings. Those proceedings are heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| on the Fifth Sessions docket, and I'm the person in our office that's been responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| for handling those matters. And so I've appeared even while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| I've been in the DA's office on the Fifth Sessions docket in that limited role handling those carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Mr. Smith, are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Thank you again for this opportunity to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1658)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you. I think I've introduced myself and met with just about everybody on the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| and wanted to go over again what my qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| for the judge's job are, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| also it was interesting to me that Dale, as a DA, has heard the same thing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| have from the clerks and the county officers and the attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| and even some of the judges, which is they all ask me, why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| do you want to be a judge? And what's funny about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| it is the tone they use, why? And to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| it seems so obvious, because it's something that I've spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| my whole career headed toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| just recently with an eye toward the bench, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| it's to make a difference. It's to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| that there are experienced judges on the bench, because I've practiced in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| all the surrounding counties in this area. Knox County is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| blessed with some experienced judges, and when you go in front of a judge that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| not know what they're doing, it's a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| And I started my career with the Poet Defender's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| I spent two years with Mark Stevens, and I was in misdemeanor court, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| shortly after that in Division 3 in front of Judge Leibowitz, and then in Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| 1 in front of Judge Baumgartner. After having my first daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and because of other factors, I made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| a decision to go into private practice and practice with Hagan, Tarpey and Cox for 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| plus years there. In that private practice I did primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| sessions work. I had about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| 20%, 15% civil cases and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| sessions court work, and I really like it. I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| being in sessions court. I like meeting the defendants and the police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and the court clerks, and I like seeing how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| and I like functioning properly in there and seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| justice. And in my private practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| I was exposed to everything from, I used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| to say to my clients when they come in, spitting on the sidewalk, to murder cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| And in my civil practice I did everything from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| wrongful death to landlord-tenant to simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| contract disputes and many of the cases down in sessions court, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| had circuit court trials and criminal court trials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| in Knox County and other counties. And then finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| even being in private practice, I realized that if I had any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| aspirations toward the bench or if I wanted to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| good, I was ready to go to the DA's office. And I didn't go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| DA's office to make more money or to work a shorter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| day. I went to the DA's office to learn and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| to experience what's happening down there, because I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| in 13 plus years of private practice, I have been in that court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| more in the last year than all those years put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| I have been prosecuting now in excess of 29,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| cases. Misdemeanor sessions court in Knox County is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| highest volume court. You're going to have public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| intoxication up to simple assaults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| simple possession, animal cruelty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| all matters of cases. And you come into contact with a lot of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| there. Theft cases, you're dealing with who had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| their gun stolen, who's shoplifting cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| everything. And by being in that court, I have gained so much experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| and did not appreciate on the other side, even as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| public defender, that what happens in terms of warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| screening, us looking at the warrants to make sure we've got all the information so the subpoenas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| will issue properly. Going down with the judicial commissioners, making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| sure that they are screening the cases there correctly. Looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| and making sure does the judicial commissioner have a means to tell by our criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| information justice system that this defendant, who they're setting a $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| cash bond on a misdemeanor theft case, also has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| already on probation. He's been in my court. We've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| pled him guilty to theft. There's no point in giving him a $500 cash bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| because now I'm going to revoke his bond when he appears before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| All sorts of things I'm learning every day and will continue to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| But I feel uniquely qualified from all perspectives, civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| criminal, and public service through the DA's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| to hit the ground running as a judge. I can tell you already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| in Sessions Court what some of the major problems are. Some of the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| problems are cost collection. Some of the major problems are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| a liberal granting of resets. But each of those cases you've got to look at on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| case-to-case basis because lots of times on a case you would think on paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| you wouldn't want to reset. Sometimes there's a valid reason for that. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| problems right now with illegal immigrants. They come before me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| they'll have a driving on revoke license or no driver's license is what I'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| I have no criminal background on that person. I don't know if they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| been involved in four prior DUIs in Mexico or they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| killed a family. And I've got to make a determination. Do I let them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| How do I proceed with that? I've got cases that involve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| now that are some of the other issues. Let me think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| chronic alcoholism and drug addiction that leads to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| repeat offenders that really bog down our dockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| The fact that we don't deal with our driving on suspended license cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| administratively. That is the most common case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| brought out by our grand jury is whether or not somebody is driving on a suspended license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| But all this said, by being in these courts I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| if I were the one that could start as judge next Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| that instead of learning the system I'm going to be able to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| trying to assist in helping fix the problems with the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| And I can do that from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Besides that, I would just welcome any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| questions you've got and I'm excited about the opportunity to make a difference in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Knox County. I hope I can get your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| Commissioner Hammond. I think, Mr. Chairman, as long as you mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| you are aware of several and you've mentioned several of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| that you would like to see addressed. One of the other gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| talked about the fact that it is a team effort. I mean, you're going to be part of a judicial team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| What needs to happen here? I mean, we all know that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| problems. We've got studies that show that there are issues. You've outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| issues. I guess, from your perspective, how do we fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| A year from now, if you were to come back and appear before us, what could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| say to us that, okay, I've taken these steps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| fix the problem? Well, you know, one of the biggest problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| for the citizens is the jail overcrowding because if a judge doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| hit the ground running there, then we're all looking at a fine that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| going to build up. And today, there's 1,068 people in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| jail. We don't want them to get more than 2,010. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| our people that clog the jail up and cost all the taxpayers a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| of money are, for instance, what I would be looking at directly is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| the chronic addicts. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| that's something that you could work with John Lawler's office on the Tenure Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| to Combat Homelessness in Knox County. There needs to be a liaison down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| because in my court, I can give you a list of names. You know, they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| me. I know them. I see them every two to three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| sometimes, except I've started holding them in jail longer just so maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| they'll realize we mean it. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| public intoxication costs us a lot of money. That, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| need to work on the homelessness situation in Knox County. We need to be working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| ICE, the immigration people, to deal with our immigrants, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| more rapidly let us know, do you have a hold on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| them? What if I release them before you contact me and there's a hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| because they're dangerous or they've had another criminal offense in the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Those are some of the things that could be done. Continuances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| The judges need to hold the defense lawyers' feet to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| fire on that. I argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| about this all the time. The public defender is not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| to represent somebody they haven't met with before. That makes perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| But what happens is public defender clients come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| and they didn't meet with their attorney and just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| get it done in five weeks. And I've got my victim witness there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| They took off from work. They're there in court. We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| And, you know, the judges will say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| well, we try to do one continuance. And it's like an understood thing, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| some of that stuff, you know, some of the judges just take them in and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| if you don't meet with your attorney, I can make sure you will meet with your attorney because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| you're going to be in jail. They can find you. The reset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| thing needs to be looked at, but there are unique situations with that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| because every case is different. Driver's license cases, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| times we reset it to allow them to get their license because ultimately for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| that if they have a license, they will have insurance. They won't be out driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| anyway and hit somebody and they just really need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| pay off their traffic citations that they've picked up over a course of years or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| like that. So we do continue those cases sometimes. But there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| are active things that can happen. And then the afternoon dockets are a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| if it can be properly funded. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| those are just some of the options you would have immediately to be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Commissioner Smith. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| Mr. Chairman. Ms. Long, as stated earlier, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| is, there are so many people that are so well qualified here, there really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| are. One or two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| what would tell us, you out there in the crowd saying, jumping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| and down saying pick me, tell us a thing or two that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| really separates you from the rest? I think I'm absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| the only candidate who has done both defense and prosecution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| and has years of private practice with civil experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| as well. I don't know that there's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| applicant here with that experience. That's your strong point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Okay. Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you, Patricia. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Chad Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2326)|
| 0:39:02| Good afternoon, ladies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| and gentlemen. I certainly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and appreciate the other candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| letting you know a little bit about this. One of the things I'm going to do that's just a little bit different is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| that I recognize that most of the candidates, as has been pointed out by some of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| questions, have a long length of experience and most of them have been practicing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| for better than 15 years, myself included. And I'm going to let you know just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| in the short time that I have, a little bit about me. Because I think that one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| that I've learned in my 17 years of practicing law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| is that the person that a judge is and what brings them to this point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| very, very important. I will get one quick thing out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| As many of you know, I was a former chairman of the Knox County Republican Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| I joked with Rebecca with the New Sentinel last week that I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| my two given names of Chad Tindall. Whenever I'm written up in the paper, I have seven names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| And then as former Republican Party chairman, Chad Tindall. That's both a blessing and a curse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| I think it's a curse from the standpoint that some of the things you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| are tainted with politics and that's not always the case. And it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| I think it restricts you because out of a 17-year career, I was chairman for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| and sometimes you're also forced to deal with people who have political axes to grind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| and other such things. But that's neither here nor there because I want you to focus on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| qualifications. I want you to focus on the things that I've done in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| Growing up, I grew up and was born in the 8th District and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| back around the mid-70s I moved west, my mother and I. I grew up with a single mother most of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| One of the things that taught you is that I had to work to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| of the other things that other kids had. And I think that work ethic is something that I've carried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| with me through my life. In college, my first year of college, I worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| delivering furniture. My remainder of college, I realized you could get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| in an air-conditioned place and that seemed to be a lot better. And there was a fine attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| here in Knoxville who gave me the opportunity to be a clerk. And since 1983,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| I've never done anything other than work in a law firm. And that's what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| I went to UT and despite my orange blood, finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| made the decision and I went to Memphis State and graduated with a law degree. They were kind enough to grant me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| a scholarship. And I graduated from Memphis State. I came back because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| I always knew I wanted to be in private practice here. And I'm different than the other candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| in some respects because, or at least some of the candidates, because my life has been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| on the other side of Main Avenue and not primarily within this courthouse. I've been successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| in this courthouse and I've tried cases in this courthouse. But my success has been, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| working with people. I have a long history of success in private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| I also think that's one of the things that distinguishes me. In my private practice, I started out as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| associate attorney. I rose and built my practice up by satisfying clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| and building a client base. And I think that when you have a professional that's successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| they build their clients and you work toward building up your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| practice. And I've done that. And one of the ways you tell that, and many of you have heard if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| lawyer friends, that you become partner. You make, in today's world, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| become a shareholder. For most of the 14 years that I've been with my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| present firm, I've been a part owner of that firm. It makes me responsible for not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| my clients and my practice and being responsible to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| partners. I'm responsible to my other partners. I'm responsible to a staff of 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| to 30 people. I have to work through those issues. That makes me a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| different. The New Sentinel did a study about three or four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| ago and they ranked the law firms in Knox County. My law firm was ranked as one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| the top ten law firms in Knox County. And I'm proud to say that because we have great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| lawyers that come out of our firm and great lawyers that do good work for their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| And that's a principle that's been instilled in me. In addition, as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| partner in my firm, one of my primary responsibilities is training young lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| And that's an interesting experience sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| But you work with them and it helps you and sometimes gives you a different perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| about the practice of law. But I think that the other thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| I'll tell you and that I think that's important because this is an important appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| And there are certainly nuts and bolts and things. And I have more experience in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| areas and maybe less so in some others. But I think that one of the things that makes me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| different is that many of you know me. Some of you know me. And if you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| ever dealt with me and worked beyond the law work, I don't think I've ever represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| any of you. But if you've known me in any other thing, you know that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| have a tremendous commitment to working hard and a tremendous commitment to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| in Knox County. I have for all of my professional career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| I decided on day one that I wanted to make a difference in my community. And if you look at my resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| one of the things you'll see is a long history of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| being on the board of directors, raising money and doing other civic work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| with the American Heart Association, Habitat for Humanity. I've hammered nails with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| fine families, working side by side with them to make their lives better with Habitat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| for Humanity. I've been involved with them for 17 years. For 14 years of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| I've done all of Habitat for Humanity's legal work for free. It's one of the ways that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| contribute and use my legal skills in giving back to the community. I presently serve on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| for Family Promise in Knoxville. We work side by side with the Coalition on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Homelessness. We work to solve the problems. It's one of the things that I made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| in my life that I wanted to do. And it gives me a unique experience and a unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| perspective because of the people that I've worked with across this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| not in one area of the community, but from the ninth district all the way to the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| I've known and met and worked side by side with people. I think that gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| me a unique experience because as judge, it's not the lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| that control the courts. It's not the judges that control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| the courts. But it's the citizens on the other side of the bar that we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| concerned about. Commissioner Hammond, I think, has raised a number of very good questions, many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| which I've addressed with each of you when I've met with you. And that is that there needs to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| changes in General Sessions Court. I am for additional dockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| There don't need to be tables set up in the old courthouse to try to handle the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| when we make and look at other dockets. For example, in my practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| my firm manages several thousand cases in any one given time across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| the state of Tennessee. Most of our work is in Knox County, but I've had an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| try cases in probably better than half the counties in the state of Tennessee. It gives you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| great insight and experience in what it takes to be a good judge. You learn a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| common sense from some small town judges. But we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| if we have an opportunity up in Sessions Court and civil sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| where most of my experience is to have an additional docket, to have either a night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| court spin suggested, an afternoon docket. For example, in Washington County, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| have an afternoon docket. And that docket is allocated to firms because there are firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| that file 40, 50 cases. They have 40, 50 cases on the docket at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| time. Well, rather than make a citizen wait for that 40 or 50 cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| to be disposed of, they set those at a different time in order to move the courts along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| more efficiently. From private practice, I think that that's where my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| skills lie, and that is I look to solve problems and I look for opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| to do things a better way. In criminal sessions, I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| I'll quickly wrap up. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| Criminal sessions, I think that it's very good that things have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| pointed out. You need to hold people's feet to the fire about costs, continuances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| and appointed lawyers. Some are entitled to be appointed, but we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| to look at those indigent certificates and make sure that those people are entitled to lawyers if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| use taxpayer dollars or the public defender's office, which is overtaxed, to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| But I think there are certainly changes we can make. And I think I have a proven track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| of both success in the practice of law, successful practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| and also a commitment to this community of making it better. That's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| I think that I would make a very good general sessions judge. It's the reason I've asked each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| for a vote and I'll ask for your vote today. I'll be glad to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| That's a good sign. Evidently you covered it all. I don't know if it's a good sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| or a bad, but I'll be pleased to speak with you at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Same question. What jumps out there in the crowd? What makes you so different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| out there from the rest? Because it's a tight race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| I think it's a 17-year commitment, both in the legal practice of law and in the successful practice of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| And also, again, as I said, working in the community. And in every job that I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| and I think that maybe you specifically have seen maybe my work a little closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| but I think in every job that I've done, whether it's civic groups, whether it's the practice of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| one of my jobs as a lawyer is that I'm a problem solver. And I need to be a problem solver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| And I need to look for solutions to make things better. And I think that the perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| from the other side of Main Avenue, where most citizens in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| make their living, that don't have too much contact with the court system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| I think that that perspective and the idea that I know how to solve problems and bring some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| solutions to it, I think that makes me different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| Are there any others? Thank you, Chad. Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2860)|
| 0:48:04| Well, thank you all for listening to us today, giving us this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| We've gone through this process before many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| I don't think any of you were still on the commission at that time, but this is a much more open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| and transparent process. And I want to thank you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| That can only benefit the people of Knox County and benefit our system of justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| I've been in private practice now for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| I've handled a wide range of cases, all the way from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| traffic tickets to death penalty cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| One of the things I want to talk about that has come up here this morning or this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| is the concept of a judge being part of a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Well, I take issue with that, most respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| I think the judge is not a part of the team. The judge is the referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| The judge is the umpire. The judge calls the balls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| and the strikes. The judge isn't there to play for one team or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| And just like the referee or the umpire has to know the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| the judge has to know the rules, the judge has to know the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| And the judge is there to be the impartial, neutral arbiter of the law, to enforce the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| and to enforce the rules. You can't be part of one team or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Ours is an adversarial process. If you're a judge and you're on one team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| or the other, you're not doing your job and you shouldn't be on the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| That's the kind of judge I want to be. I've been in solo practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| for 30 years. I'm a pretty independent guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| I've made a living. I'm a small businessman. I run my own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| My practice, and I've done that successfully for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| I work hard for my clients. I work hard for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| I think that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| qualifies me uniquely to be a judge in Sessions Court is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| the depth, breadth, and variety of my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| As I've set forth in my letter to you, I've flipped burgers, I've cut Vega gears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| for GM, I've worked as a psychiatric technician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| in Lakeshore Mental Health Institute, and I probably am the only one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| candidates that has done that. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| lesser known functions of the Sessions Court judge, and Commissioner Hammond brought it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| earlier, is that you also hold mental health hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| My experience at Lakeshore brings an especially unique insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| into those kinds of issues. I'm a sociology major and a psychology minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| I've studied mental health issues extensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| in addition to working there. So I do bring those unique insights and those unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| experiences. In my practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| when I first came into practice, the uniform residential landlord-tenant law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| had just been passed, and I cut my teeth on that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| One of the lawyers, thankfully I didn't have to unlearn something, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| learned that law from the ground up and inside and out, and that's a large part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| civil jurisdiction in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| In General Sessions Court, and that's already been alluded to, there are thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| of cases that go through those courts every week. The Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Court judge doesn't have the luxury of being able to take something under advisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| and going and studying the law, seeing what the law is, and then coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| a week or two later and rendering an opinion. You've got to know what the law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| when you're sitting on that bench. You've got to know what decisions to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| I've tried death penalty cases many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| And in those cases, I'm literally making life and death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| decisions every day, sometimes every minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| of that trial. If I can make those kinds of decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| in representing my clients, I can assure you that I can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| the decisions that ought to be made and need to be made in General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| And that's basically all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Appreciate any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| Commissioner Hammond. In looking at your resume, Mr. Reagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| would you tell us what involvement have you had with Sessions Court during your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| time as a lawyer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| any experience that you've had with Sessions Court? I've been in Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| practically every day of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| Certainly not every day, but I'm in Sessions Court many, many times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| I've handled, I've defended civil cases, I've prosecuted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| civil cases in the civil part of it. I've done felonies, DUIs, misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| I've done mental health hearings. In the past, I don't do those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| anymore. But I've also sat as Special Sessions Court judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| on more occasions than I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| Back in the, I believe it was the late 80s or early 90s when Judge Creekmore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| was assigned to Panama with the National Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| Filled in for him during the 90 days that he was down there. And I know the attorneys shared those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| duties. So I know what the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| looks like from the prosecution side. I've also prosecuted cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| probably not in Sessions Court, but in criminal court. Not only in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| County, but in other counties. So I know what it looks like from the prosecution side, from the defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| side, and from the judge's side. I not only do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| trial work, I do a great deal of appellate work. One lawyer told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| if I didn't lose so many cases, I wouldn't have to do so many appeals. But I've done a great deal of appellate work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| not only in the state, on the state side, but also on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| federal side and Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| I know what a case looks like from the ground when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| in the trial. I know what a case looks like on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| appeal when you're sitting there reading the transcript. I know what needs to be in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| transcript. I know what that transcript needs to look like when those judges are looking at it. You want a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| to be able to do it right the first time. Because if it has to come back and you've got to do it over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| that costs the taxpayers more money, uses up more court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| time, and is not efficient. We are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| at a number of issues in our Sessions Court, and they've been discussed here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Everything from collection of fees, to chronic alcoholism that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| clogging up the courts, to illegal immigrants, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| holding people's feet to the fire and making sure that you're not having to do a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| of continuances. So I guess my question to you would be what I've asked some of the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| is, a year from now, if you were to come back before us, what could we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| all right, Judge Reagan, you have been able to accomplish what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| I hope I've been able to accomplish making the court more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| handling the cases more effectively. The judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| that we have there now do a great job. But you've got to understand, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| said, there are thousands of cases that go through there, and I think they're doing the best they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| with the resources they've got. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| again, I think that one of the problems that we have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| with appointed counsel. I think that not enough is being looked into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| with regard to the defendant's financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| situations to see if they really qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| I think more can be done with reduced fee panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| I've seen those used in other places. We've tried to use them here before. I think we can bring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| back to take some of the load off the public defender's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| to use less taxpayer money in getting these poor people the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| constitutional right that they have to effective assistance of counsel. I think that could be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| by using the reduced fee panels, getting more private attorneys involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| in doing that. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| like to see cases that are going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| preliminary hearings or bench trials to be set specially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| not lump them in with the other hundreds of cases that are coming through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| You know, when you have people, as Mr. Hawley was talking about, when you have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| subpoenaed to come into court at 9 o'clock, everybody comes in there at 9 o'clock and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| sitting around there all day. Well, it's not that there's no work being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| There's a lot of work being done. There are cases being pled, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| are other things going on. A lot of work gets done. But then the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| that are there for the hearings, the witnesses, the defendants, the victims, the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| officers, those are the people that have to sit around. They shouldn't have to sit around all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| If we can set special hearings in the afternoons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| for bench trials, if we can set maybe one day a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| for one division to have specially set preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| hearings cases that we know we're going to have to have hearings on, let's set those at a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| time and subpoena those people for that time and place. I think that's a much more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| use of judicial time and even the taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| Commissioner Norman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you, Mr. Reagan. I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| sensed something that you said there earlier. Obviously we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| live in a very interesting political atmosphere in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| Knox County. And I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| heard something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| some of that political atmosphere affecting you earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| in your career and some of the decisions that you made regarding your practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| or your relationship to government. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| would you put a little flesh on that, if you care to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| What effect did it have on you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Obviously you've spoken to your independents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| So something in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| Well, it's just that I think that the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| we are going about this today is the proper way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| We've got seven or eight qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| people. Each one of us is qualified to be a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| But to be able to stand here before you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| make my case, knowing that there have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| not been any backroom deals cut, knowing that there has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| knowing that the decision hasn't already been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| I think that is a much better system of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Much more effective system of government. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| we'll come out with a better quality of candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| Maybe a better judge out of the process, whether it's me or one of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| I really appreciate this process and I appreciate you all allowing us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| Commissioner Smith. I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| mention to the audience, I don't know if we're on TV or not, it doesn't matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| but a lot of commissioners were not asking questions because we have already interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| a lot of these people on a one-on-one basis and I have met with you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| So a lot of our, you know, it's not like we're up here not on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| log, we have already talked to a lot of these candidates. It was one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| I was getting ready to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| Are there any others? Thank you, Mr. Reagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3533)|
| 0:59:05| Glenna Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3545)|
| 0:59:17| Thank you, Commissioner Strickland. I had an opportunity to meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| all of you, most of you, on a one-on-one basis, but there's a couple that I didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| an opportunity to meet with because of our schedules, so I'd like to briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| talk about my experience, which makes me, I consider, qualified for the Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| judge. I've been in private practice for 16 years. I've represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| plaintiffs and defendants in civil matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| I've represented defendants in criminal matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| I've accepted court-appointed cases. I've accepted indigent cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| pro bono cases. I'm licensed to practice in all the courts of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| the United States District Court, and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| I've also had experience sitting as special judge in Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| when requested by Judges McGee, Stansberry, Emory, and Judge Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| And I also have a passion for the law, and I believe I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| be an asset to the legal system, to the judicial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| There's room for improvement in this legal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| Criminal courts definitely have a lot of ills to cure. Some of the issues we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| is the overcrowding of our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| We also have understaffing of the district attorneys, the public defender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| law enforcement, and the correctional officers. We have very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| limited alternatives to our prison programs, and we have such a backlog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| of our criminal cases. I'm not here to tell you that I have answers to all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| things, but if I am appointed, I will work diligently to see if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| find alternatives to the status quo and work with each group in the criminal justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| system to improve it. I do believe it's been discussed today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| that there should be a better managing of the court system. I believe that there should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| be a staggering of the court schedule, staggering of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| as well as a night court. Night court allows us to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| traffic offenses, misdemeanor sites, and maybe some other specific crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| This will give the citizens of Knox County an opportunity to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| without having to take time off from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| This will also prevent other cases from being reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| Not only will this be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| for the citizens, but it will allow board defendants to appear in front of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| in the time that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| I also believe that this will allow citizens to appear in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| and therefore, as they may not appear in court, because they couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| take off time from work and then a failure to appear will be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| another warrant for their arrest. While the criminal side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| Sessions Court really has a lot of focus, I think the civil side is also just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| as important. As I've said many times when I've talked to each of you commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| that I feel like civil court is the court for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| This is where the citizens of Knox County can come into court and have resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| of their disputes and disagreements without taking the matters into their own hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| And there are the issues such as the mental health issues and family law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| I believe with my background and my experience as a solo practitioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| mediation training and the experience that I've had sitting on the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| that I am qualified to be the Sessions Court judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| I'm committed to improving the court system. I enjoy practicing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| law. I have a passion for the law and I will work hard for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| I was just going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| those of you that have served as the substitute judges, how has it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| arrived at that you become a substitute judge or what are the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| for that? There was a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| put out especially when Judge Wagner was taking a medical leave for those who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| interested to sit as special judge. I submitted my name and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| assuming that the judges reviewed those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| The judges that sit special do not get paid. This is time off from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| And since that time I've just expressed my interest to learn by sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| on the bench more and more to learn more about sitting as a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| judge. So this year I've been very fortunate, very honored for Judge Stansbury and Judge Magee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| and Judge Emery to ask me to sit in for them this year. And I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| from 2005 to this year as special judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Glenn, same question I'm trying to ask everybody else. What makes you pop? What makes you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| stand out above the other candidates? I think it's my training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| and mediation. My training is sitting as special judge to allow me to be neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| to learn how to be neutral when the parties come in front of you. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| it's also the passion that I have for the law because I really do enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| practicing law and I really think I can be of benefit to the court system by being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| as a judge. Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. Overton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| when you've sat in, and maybe you can answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| sat in as a special judge, have you sat in all the different sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| or do they normally assign the special judge to a certain one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| or do you know ahead of time what you're going to be? I requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| to only sit in, when I first started this, to only sit in as a civil sessions judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| because I felt like that is where I was the most comfortable. However, let me say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| that I've heard cases that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| not under my, what I would call expertise, for example, auto parts cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| I'm learning more and more about the parts of cars when I've sat as a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| But that, I've never asked to sit on the criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| side. Do they ever ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| special judges to sit on the criminal side? I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| they do, but I was also informed that when Judge McGee took criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| court bench that sometimes they would have the other judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| sit on the criminal side because as on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| criminal side and on the civil side, a party that is in front of a special judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| has a right to ask for an elected judge to hear the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| other questions? Thank you, Ms. Overton. Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3925)|
| 1:05:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| commissioners. I appreciate this opportunity to come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| today. First off, I had delivered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| to the commission office, I think last week, a packet of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| with my letter, resume, references. I've talked to a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| of commissioners who said they did not get that packet or maybe didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| have it at the time I spoke with them. If anyone does not have the packet, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| do have a couple of copies with me here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| As I said earlier, my name is Mark Brown. In my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| resume, you will note that I tried to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| towards the whole position of General Sessions Court Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| I've heard some questions here today about different facets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| of individuals' involvement in the community. I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| list an awful lot of things that I've done in the community professionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| with regards to my involvement, with regards to organizations, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| I tried to specify and deal with the General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| First off, let me say, this has been a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| process and I actually feel very blessed to be here. I've discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| through this process, I want to say to those folk who are at home watching and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| folk who are here with me today that I appreciate so much the kind words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| that have been said about me to commissioners and have been said here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| today. I would be remiss if I didn't do something right now, not out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| of form or fashion, not out of effect, because I sit as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| Vice Mayor of the City of Knoxville and sit exactly where you guys are sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| and this kind of action doesn't sway my vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| but there are a lot of people who took time out today to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and say, Mark, we're with you. I wanted the commissioners to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| see and out of respect for them and them spending gas to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| to ask those folk to please stand who came to Swamp Beach so that I could tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| thank you from me to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you. And they didn't expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| me to do that. But I know my wife is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| my mother-in-law is here, my mother is here, my sister-in-law, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| I've got to go home and deal with them, so I want to make sure that I am still as loved as I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| when I came in here is when I get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| Very briefly, when you're looking at this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| and ask why is Mark Brown here, I'm here because I'm offering myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| once again to try and serve the community that I love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| I'm a native Knoxvillian, born here, raised here, went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| public school here, went to University of Tennessee, University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Law School. I've run a non-profit agency, a United Way agency in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| I've served for 15 years as an attorney in this town. In those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| 15 years, I've practiced in the Knox County General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| I, too, have served as special judge in the Knox County General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| Court, dating back to as early as 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| And I have served Commissioner Leuthold in all of those courts, criminal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| and civil courts. As was alluded earlier, the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| have to agree to hearings. Some folks sit as special judges sometime and may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| have never had a hearing. I've actually had to conduct hearings, civil side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| and on the criminal side, when the parties have allowed me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| I have also served as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| a special hearing officer for the Civil Service Merit Board of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| As a special hearing officer for the Board of Professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| Responsibility of the State of Tennessee for the legal community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| I also have served and currently serve as a hearing officer for the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| of Medical Examiners. Why is that important? I think that differentiates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| me from all the other candidates. Sitting in those particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| capacities, I've had to make rulings of law, findings of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| fact, receive evidence, make decisions and render| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| judgments. I've actually had to sit in a judicial capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| on those hearing panels. I did that for the Board of Professional Responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| for six years. I currently do that for the Board of Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Examiners, where we sit down and evaluate all the evidence that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| before. So besides just sitting as a special judge, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| operated and performed in a quasi-judicial capacity in those functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| Additionally, being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Knox County Jurisdiction judge, one must be able to interface with not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| attorneys, but also with the public, also with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| those individuals who are witnesses and those who are victims, those individuals who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| are defendants. And to be able to do that, you must have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| to manage those folk who are coming from different backgrounds. My experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| as vice mayor in the city of Knoxville, I've had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| chair city council meetings. I've had to chair public workshops where I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| to manage the interpersonal reactions between individuals. I've had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| manage a docket in that sense also. I've had to be able to efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| effectively with respect and to move forward professionally through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| those types of issues. That is a talent and a skill that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| needed at the General Assistance Corps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| thing that I did not put in my resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| to you, and it's been pointed out to me, that maybe I should point it out to you. I've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| been vetted by the Tennessee Judicial Selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| Commission. The Tennessee Judicial Selection Commission is a statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| commission that evaluates attorneys for recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| to the governor of the state of Tennessee to go and be a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| In 2004, I went through that process, which was a very extensive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| of application, of public interviews, of private interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| and I was recommended to the governor of the state of Tennessee along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| three other individuals out of a lot of attorneys to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| be considered for a judicial position on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| Tennessee Court of Appeals. I'm not sure if anyone else here has done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| but that's one of the things, Commissioner Smith, that would separate me from other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| I've actually been vetted, my background checked, my credentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| checked, my writing skills checked, my ability and my demeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| checked, and I was recommended by a panel from across the state of Tennessee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| has consumers, attorneys, and judges to say, yes, he's qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Why do I want to serve? I want to serve because this is my town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| This is my community. I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| I have a history of serving and think that I can make a difference in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| Knotts County General Sessions Court. Thank you, and I'll be glad to entertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| any questions, and I thank each of the commissioners who have taken time out to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| to me in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| I'm asking this question, and a couple of them I haven't asked questions to because I've asked it to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| privately and they've given me the answers, so I haven't had a chance to talk with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Brown, but this goes to your vision for Sessions Court, Mr. Brown, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| again, a year from now, if you were to appear before us and we could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| a Judge Brown, what have you done to improve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| Sessions Court in Knox County? What are some of the things that you feel you could come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| and say to us? You know, that's a difficult question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| because I'm sure that if I am blessed to be chosen in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| position, when I come back in a year, you're going to ask me, did I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| What I can say is that the first thing I would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| is, as I've listened to some of the concerns with regards to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| you would want to do evening court, how do we manage dockets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| collection of fees, first place you start is you start with the parties that are involved, and by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| that I mean I would not walk in the door and say to the other four General Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| judges, here I am, Mark Brown, I've got a way to solve it, and let's follow my lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| I need to talk to those individuals and find out what they have in mind, what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| think about the plan. I would also need to talk to the DA and the public defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| My hope is that when I came back to you, I would be able to say, yes, we now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| have a more efficient process. Yes, we have a process that is respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| of all parties with regards to not only time, but the expenditure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| resources and the collection of resources. I would hope to be able to come back to you and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| we have made progress on that report that you mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| Yeah. Mr. Brown, one thing, and I've watched you for a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| of years on city council. Long before I was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| county commissioner, I was a community activist. And one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| thing that I have seen about you is that you are an extraordinarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| fair person with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| When I've spoken before city council, you have been very fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| and very open. And what I'm wondering is, are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| going to bring that same fairness into the courtroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Because I think there's nothing more, nothing greater you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| ask than let a judge be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Yes, I would. And I don't do that at city council because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| I think it's, I don't do it for effect. I do it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| it's a part of Mark Brown. My father, who passed several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| was a minister, eighth grade education, and a chef in his town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| My mother, who is here with me today, is a retired social service worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| In my family, one of the things that we were taught growing up is that your word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| be your bond, be a man of your word, treat everybody fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| It's a part of who Mark Brown is. So just because I would be a senior's judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| I would not change from that. I think that is of the utmost importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| from our judiciary, that you treat people the same, no matter if they're from the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| side, the east side, the north side, or the west side. Whether they're male| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| or female, whether they're Democrat or Republican, whether they're black or white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| They all are citizens of Knox County to be treated respectfully. If they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| there as individuals being prosecuted, I would enforce the law and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| sure that the law is enforced fairly. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| Commissioner Anders. Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| the boards that you served on, the professional responsibility and the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| examiner's board, are the rules of evidence the same there as they are in criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| court? In some instances, the board of medical examiners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| deals with the Administrative Procedures Act. Just as the general sessions court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| the rules of evidence apply there except in a couple of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| The criminal procedure rules, some of those apply in general sessions court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| and some of them don't. But you do try to get that evidence in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| You do have issues of evidence being presented in the right manner and to be evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| by the hearing panel so you can evaluate the weight, sufficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| and credibility of that evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| Commissioner Briggs. Yes, Vice Mayor Brown. I was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| again at your resume here with judicial experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| and you've served, I guess, as a special judge that we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| about just a moment ago. But you mentioned here also that you've served in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| criminal division courts, the sessions courts. Yes, I have, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| the civil division. When they, this is just a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| information question also, when they decide to pick a special judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| or ask a special judge to sit in these courts, how do they decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| that particular day whether you go to the civil courts or criminal courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| I think how that decision is made is based on where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| the vacancy occurs. Where that particular general sessions judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| is assigned on that day or that week. They're assigned on a weekly basis. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| the general sessions judge who is absent that day for whatever reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| is sitting in misdemeanor court, then that's where you would go serve if you have the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| and are agreeing to do that. If they're missing from the civil docket and you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| you're willing to do that, then you would go to the civil court. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| You're welcome. Commissioner Smith. Yes, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| Vice Mayor. Appreciate your service in the community. I think highly of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| too. Thank you, sir. On a month's basis, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| much time do you personally spend as an attorney? How much time do you spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| in this judge area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| As an attorney or over in general sessions court? General sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| It varies. There are times when I'm in general sessions court four or five times a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| week, and then there are some weeks I'm not there at all. It would be hard for me to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| a timeline on it. My cases with regards to those that go in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| general sessions court varies. Sometimes I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| caseload of where out of my whole hundred percent of cases, whether they're civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| or criminal, I might have only 20, 10, 20, 30 percent of them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| are criminal and have started over in the general sessions court. I've had occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| in the past when I guess the late 90s, early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| 2000s where I think I was there about every day handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| a case. So I'm there quite often. If I was to average it right now, I'd say at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| two times a week, maybe three. As I said, some weeks you don't see me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| then some weeks they'll see me every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| Do you have another question, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4738)|
| 1:19:12| John Owens. No, Mary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Evers-Golan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| I'll let him go for me. He did such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| Good afternoon, everyone. Mr. Commissioner Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| and the rest of the commissioners, I do appreciate you taking your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| to hear me ask you to appoint me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| as the general sessions court judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| I've been listening to everyone and of course it's hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| to be the lead off and it's I think maybe even harder to be the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| And I'm very humbled by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| being part of this candidacy and I do appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| this opportunity. As a judge, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| believe that there's four components that are most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| and that's either in general sessions or any judge position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| That's to listen, learn, interpret and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| decisive. And you'll see that my credentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| as listed in my resume that I have given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| to everyone would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| fulfill all of those requirements. Listening, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| well, I guess my listening career began when I was born. My parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| I was born in Knoxville, Tennessee and I grew up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| South Knoxville and then upon getting married I moved to West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| And throughout my career in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| law school and in undergraduate school, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| listened to get me through school. I was a bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| a server and a waitress. And I worked my way through school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| never taking a penny from anyone for anything. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| became very independent in that nature and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| I guess decisive also because when you survive on your own and you have to make all your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| decisions, you learn very quickly. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| I went to a university in Memphis and then it was called Memphis State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| I graduated magna cum laude. I didn't have any sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| and that may make me very efficient as a judge too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| because I think one of the reasons that there perhaps is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| some inefficiency in the system is judges aren't prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I would be prepared for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| From then I worked several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| jobs as you can see in my resume and as far as my legal career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| I began working for Stokes and Fansler law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| I was presented to the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| in 1992 by Chancellor Fansler. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| stood beside me and introduced me as being a good candidate for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| bar. Since then I worked there for some time and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| I became a prosecutor. I was a prosecutor for juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| I did that for five and a half years, doing anywhere from 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| to 50 cases a day, organizing them, prosecuting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| and getting them finished. I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| I worked with Judge Cary Garrett. He was a wonderful mentor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| and I was very sorry to lose him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| I took over the ERISA department and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| organized it. That's the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| department. That was relinquished by the DA's office in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| 1993 and I was given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| task of revamping that and putting that together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| having a staff. So I led that staff. I learned from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| I learned from everyone, from anything and everything I do in life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| and that's something else a judge needs to do is learn. A judge does not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| everything. A judge needs to learn from everyone and everything they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| I spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| five and a half years juvenile court prosecuting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| after that I decided to go into private practice. That was ten and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| ago. And I went with a firm of Slovis, Rutherford and Weinstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| I became of counsel with them. And that means basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| I am my own boss. I work within my own calendar, my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| system and I organize myself and I make sure everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| is done for me by me. However, I do share cases with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| firm. We all do. And we all work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| and it has been very productive and I have loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| working there. I do have to say that I miss Norbert Slovis. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| recently passed away. And that has really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| motivated me to make a decision for a change. I have thought about becoming a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| judge for many years. And my grandmother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| before she passed away, and I was in my last year of law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| she said, well, you know, you're going to be a judge someday. And I said, well, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| We'll see. But she said that because of my nature. My nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| is to be balanced, listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| and make decisions. Also, as I indicated, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| another requirement, I believe, for a proper judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| And that is to be able to interpret. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| far, all the candidates before me have not mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| And I look at that as being probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| the main element for a judge. You have to be able to interpret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| the legislative intent, the language of the law. You have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| able to impose the law. I believe I can do that. The reason being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| is because I, of course, have been on both sides of the bench as a prosecutor and a defendant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| I have had to interpret the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| in every aspect you can imagine. Additionally, in law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| I took every class available for legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| interpretation. And since then, I've taken many other CLE classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| because I believe, as a lawyer, it was very important to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| what the law meant and said. And I will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| to impose that knowledge that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| acquired. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| have also been a leader in the community. As you can see on my resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| I have been on many boards. I have served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| as president of some. I am the immediate past president of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| a very large non-profit volunteer organization called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| Hadassah. It's called the Knoxville Chapter of Hadassah, the local chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| here. We have 500 members approximately. And nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| or I should say internationally, there are 500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| Like I said, it is the largest organization in the world of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| I was president for two years. I was elected to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| I led my board. My board taught me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| many things. I have used that in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| And I have just recently been elected, as of last weekend, to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| region board for Hadassah. Many of you may have heard of Hadassah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| It's been on every national news program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| ever. 48 hours, 60 minutes, a day show, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| You name it, it's been on every news program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| And it is an organization designed to bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| the peace in the Middle East primarily, but to give medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| attention to anyone and everyone who needs it. Primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| in the Middle East, but however, Hadassah has built numerous clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| throughout the United States and promotes numerous workshops on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| medical care and interpersonal actions with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| people and how not to discriminate and how to get along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| and communicate with others. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| have spent a lot of time in General Sessions. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| been the primary attorney for a company called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| Ridgedale Townhouses. Their landlord-tenant, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| Hammond, I know you asked that question about landlord-tenant law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| I believe that I'm very well disciplined in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Additionally, I've done many other cases in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| General Sessions Civil. I've also done many cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| in General Sessions Criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| It sounded like it was behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| Thank you. Please give me this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| I will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| as I think a judge should do, and that is be respectful of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5268)|

| 1:39:18| justice system to resolve many of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| not just to limit her focus on the court itself but to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| the issues overall. She has sat as a special judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| for many of the Sessions court judges in their absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| To think about that, it takes a great deal of respect for and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| trust in someone to allow them to sit for a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| in their time of absence. Glenna has consistently earned that respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| and trust to not only be asked to represent them once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| but to be asked many times to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| I'm asking you to consider her qualifications, her experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| and to vote to appoint her as General Sessions judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| on Monday. Thank you. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6002)|

| 1:41:14| And let me say also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| that I know every one of these lawyers. I know them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| And I cannot tell you that they're not all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| qualified to be judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| to be a Sessions Court judge. They're all qualified lawyers, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| as far as I know, I make the assumption that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| they don't have any outstanding complaints on them by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| the Board of the Judiciary, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| that they don't owe back taxes or anything that would be an embarrassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| I know all these people. They're fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| It was very difficult for me to make a decision to come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| today because I have a great deal of admiration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| and respect for each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| But I think you need to take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| and consider the fit. Who is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| to be the best fit for this job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| This is a high-paced, high-volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| stressful, impact job, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| somebody that has this job has to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| and they have to do it quickly and they have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| it correctly. You can't spend an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| or three days going to a legal document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| or going and doing research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| on these matters. You have to have it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| then, right there. In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| you have to be independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| You need to not have blinders on, be pro-prosecution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| pro-defense, pro-poor, pro-rich, or any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| characteristics. Lady Justice is blind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| for a reason. And you have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| able to see all facets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| of the justice system. Many of the things that you talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| about today are systemic all over the justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| It's just not the Sessions judge. Everybody needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| be involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| The person that I'm going to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| who I am supporting, is Patricia Hall Long. She's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| there every day. She's been in that court every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| for the last 16 years. Many of these lawyers I practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| raised. Except for Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| Reagan. Now, he and I kind of raised ourselves up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| We've been around. And Randy's a very good friend of mine. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| he's an excellent lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| But you have to give some great thought about one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| experience in making sure it's the right fit for Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| Some of these lawyers would be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| judges in circuit, or chancery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| or criminal court. But it's the Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| is a different animal. And if they don't like the job when they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| down there, or they're stressed, and they can't deal with all these different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| things that go on at one time, they're not going to like the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| The public's not going to like them. Neither are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| law enforcement personnel, or witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| and victims that come before the court. And I've seen judges like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| that. I've also seen judges that are too political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| You need to make judicial decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| not political decisions. And you've got to be good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| You've got to be a generalist, and you do have to roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| with the flow. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| of all these people, Patricia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| fits the bill. And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| the public deserves the most qualified person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| to sit on the bench,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| who is the right fit for the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| who is there for the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| reasons, who can see the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| and administer justice. There's a lot more than sitting in the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| when you do all that, and you come to that conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| then the one thing that hasn't been talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| today is diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| And when you get to that point, then I think that diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| is a plus. But I think that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| look through this and give a lot of thought to it, you'll find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| this is the best candidate for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| And I'm not saying others can't do the job. I respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| them and I like them. And some of them I didn't even know had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| applied. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| Billy Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6386)|
| 1:46:40| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, my name is Billy Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| I practice at the firm of Stokes, Williams, Sharp, and Davies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| We're down on Volunteer Landing near Roost Chris. I'm sure a lot of y'all eat at Roost Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| regularly. It's not too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| But I've got a long background with most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| candidates here. I know all of them a little bit. I know several of them very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| And that goes back to something I heard Senator Baker say once, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| I was a young lawyer one time, but I got over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| I think that's what's happened to me. I got over being a young lawyer. Randy Reagan and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| go back to right out of law school, practicing law as young lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| around town here. I don't know Ms. Long very well, but I know her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| dad from being quite an esteemed lawyer here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| I've done work for John Owings from time to time when he was a county law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| I know him well, like him a lot. We have Dale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| Holly. I've had some cases that I've had to work out with him. I don't do much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| criminal practice, so I haven't had much of that. Ms. Overton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| I don't know her very well, but some partners of mine speak very, very highly of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| And Mary Evers, you heard her talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| she started out clerking for us. And I don't know who else I've left out, if anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| I know everybody in some way. But with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| one thing, Commissioner Norman, I heard you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| mention to either one or two of the candidates about politics, and I heard one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| candidates mention it. My partner was Darryl Fancer, and he's now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| a Chancellory Court Chancellor. He was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| Democrat. He is a Democrat. And you know what? Partisan politics means so little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| in the practice of law or standing in front of a court. It's just a meaningless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| designation. And I'm a former Republican chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| for Knox County, and I think that any chairman of any party in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| any county will tell you that the adjective former is just a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| That's the best thing you can possibly be as a former chairman when it comes to that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| But partisan politics has little or nothing to do with the practice of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| or with the appointment of a judge or the service of a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| And I'm here to talk to you about Chad Tindall, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| fear any kind of reprisal from any of these other lawyers. If Chad's not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| appointee and somebody else gets appointed, not a single one of them is going to hold it against me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| if I appear before them in court. I know that. But I appear very little in sessions of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| That's not another reason. Chad and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| have got a lot in common, except I'm quite a few years older than him, and neither| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| of us knew the other and rode a motorcycle until we showed up together somewhere one time. He was on a motorcycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| and I was too. And over the years we started taking trips together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| And when you travel with somebody and you share rooms with somebody far away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| from home, that sort of thing, you get to know them pretty well. And you can have a lot of talks late at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| that sort of thing. And I've always been impressed with Chad's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| sense of fairness and sense of fair play. And when you meet a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| sometimes we travel with some folks that you all may not be too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| thrilled to see us with, but sometimes we travel with folks that are rich and famous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| It's just the way it is in the motorcycle world. But Chad treats everybody with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| respect and he's open to everybody. And I've got to know a little bit about his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| practice. Well, I've got to know a whole lot about his practice, and I refer a lot of cases to him. It's stuff that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| I don't do. I refer to him and his firm because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| are very good at what they do. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| Sessions Court has changed a whole lot since I started practicing. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| basically a civil lawyer. I do very little criminal work, some, but very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| And over the last couple of years, the General Assembly saw fit to raise the jurisdictional limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| in Sessions Court civil side to $25,000. It used to just be $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| Now it's $25,000. There's a whole lot of cases that can be tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| and resolved when that $15,000 was added on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| And I'd like somebody that understands that, that understands what a car wreck is about, understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| what comparative fault is, understands about contract law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| liquidated damages, those sorts of things. It's not all criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| There's a whole lot of people that come to Sessions Court and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| the civil side, that's where the rubber meets the road in the legal system. And with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| I want to just tell you that I think the world of Chad Tindall, I think he's a fair guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| I think all these other candidates, all of them would be fair. But I think Chad does have the appropriate temperament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| the experience and the background to make a great Sessions judge. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, while he's there, I'd like to. Mark Brown is the one I left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| And Mark Brown and I have broken bread and chicken wings together on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| And that's who I was looking for. Mr. Chairman, can I take just 30 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| Billy, while you're there, Billy, you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| you're a former chairman. Chad Tindall is a former chairman. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| I'm just appalled at this letter that we got today. It just flies all over me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| It's very disrespectful for you, Mr. Tindall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| or what happened here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| to call yourself a former GOP chairman and the person passes these letters out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| then leaves and helps the other party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| on elections. All it does is bring down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| Republican Party. And I'm just appalled that they did this to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| And it doesn't surprise me, but every time they do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| they lose political clout, in my mind. That's for another forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| Like I said, I don't think partisan politics has a doggone thing to do with Sessions. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| We need to move on. I just want to apologize for you for that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6720)|

| 1:52:16| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, my name is Wilson Ritchie. I'm an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| here in Knoxville, Tennessee. I've been practicing for 43 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| here. I live at 9105 Bolton Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| I've known Chad Tindall since he was about six years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| Chad's mother has worked for me for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| in excess of 34 years. I've known Chad because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| he came to work in our firm and he worked as a clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| during his high school years and then through college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| He was a hardworking, industrious young man who was always honest, always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| did the right thing. He went to the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| and then went on to Memphis Law School. While he was in Memphis, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| worked for us in the summer months. He always did an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| I think that he would make a truly outstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| General Sessions judge. He has the temperament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| He's fair-minded. He is the type of young man that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| will represent you well, represent the community well. He does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| not only from his legal practice, but he also does that from his community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| involvement. He's been involved in many things, as he said, Habitat for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| Humanity, most recently the Franklin Graham crusade. He's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| so many things for the community that most people don't see. I urge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| you to consider Mr. Tindall for this General Sessions judgeship. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Thank you. I don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| other names. Is there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| person that would like to come to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| Well, seeing none, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| We adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| We will be selecting the judge at 2 o'clock Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| Commissioner Shelf. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| This is the first one of these I've been through. It's been very educational. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| eight extremely well-qualified candidates. My recollection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| of these situations in the past, I just want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| a question out. Has there been anyone aware of a poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| or recommendation or a rating from the Knox County Bar Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| in this regard? I haven't seen one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| They have been done in the past. I have seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| And I don't know that they've done it for this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| I've not seen it done on this one. Mr. Chairman, when we make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| selection on Monday, will that person be sworn in immediately or will there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| be another swearing-in ceremony? I know in the past we've actually sworn them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| that day right after the vote. Do you know if that will be the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| I think we're the ones that set it up and I think it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| Would that be the very first item? Very first on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080918judges?start=6910)|
