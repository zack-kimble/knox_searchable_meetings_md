| 0:02:33| as well as be able to give this board your point of view and the facts that you would like to have them to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| Once you have done that, we will turn it over to the body where they will ask questions and or deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| Okay? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Okay. At this time, I'll call Wolfie May. Captain May, if you'd please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| Captain Allen Wolfie May, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| February 6, 2014, I conducted an underage beer sting at Mr. Zip 5515 Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| Purchased a six-pack of Bud Light Platinum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=188)|
| 0:03:18| Mr. Haney, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| Mr. Haney, you heard the charges made before you. Do you deny or affirm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| We affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| At this time, if you would like to present anything to this board of your point of view, this is your opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| The clerk or the store manager actually was working, Ms. Sarah Ellis, simply did not follow company policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=221)|
| 0:03:51| Our company policy clearly states that we do not accept any under 21 IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| We don't even look at them to see if that person has actually had a birthday since they received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| If we receive an under 21 driver's license, our policy says we're to immediately hand that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| See, she simply did not follow company policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| She has been through the Knoxville beer class task, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| She's also been through the TIPS training program that either myself or my counterpart, Jody Towns, teaches for the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| We are both certified to teach the TIPS program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| She has been trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| She simply made an error in judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| She's paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| Anything else you'd like to state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| I don't know what else to say, except we're sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| What was the finding on the first offense on May 23rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| What was the penalty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| They were fined $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| What was that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| May of last year, 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Well, we need a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Mr. Chairman, in view of the second offense, in accordance with our ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| I move that they be fined $1,000 or suspended for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| Mr. Henry, you said that your manager there is the one that made the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| Is she still the manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| The court has seen fit to treat her leniently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| They, I believe, are going to dismiss the charges, provided that she does not have any issues for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=352)|
| 0:06:01| And we felt like if the court is willing to give her a second chance, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| This is not the same clerk that was the first violator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| No, this is her first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Yes, I'd just like to hear from the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| Ma'am, would you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| I need your name and address for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| My name is Sarah Elizabeth Ellis, and I live at 2204 Adair Drive, Apartment 11, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| Okay, just give us a little description of what happened and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| It was a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| I had worked 13 hours on a 14-hour shift, and I think I had about seven or eight people in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| And the lady came to the counter, and she had a six-pack of Bud Light Platinum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| And I looked at the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| I had it in my hand, but I misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| I just misread it, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Thirteen hours on a 14-hour shift might have something to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| We're actually not allowed to do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| We have a motion for a $1,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Sir, are your employees, are these employees minimum wage employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Slightly above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| As manager, she does make a little more than the average employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Sir, you have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| A $20,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| You'll pay the clerk within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=465)|

| 0:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Do you choose the suspension or the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| We will pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=473)|

| 0:08:39| 3130 Circle Oak Drive, Paul Sixpack Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| Mr. Naylor, you have an opportunity to affirm or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=532)|

| 0:08:58| and then we'll turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| I'm the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| I took the ID, took it in the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| looked at it, misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| We checked many, many IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| I've caught quite a few, turned down people that their birthday is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| We just try to do good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| I made a mistake, and that's kind of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Don't blame anybody but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| So I just misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| Also, we've all done the top-shelf class and keep current with those unemployees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=573)|

| 0:09:50| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=590)|

| 0:10:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=600)|

| 0:10:08| So how long have you had this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Since June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Since June of last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Well, the previous owner had two strikes against him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| And when he came up here with his changeover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| I made the comment that day that since you'd had two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| then I was not going to be very lenient with the first time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| So even though this is a first time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| I'm going to recommend a $1,000 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=636)|
| 0:10:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| Motion fails without a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Is there a new motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| I mean, I'm almost there, Commissioner Brown, with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| I just think there's something else coming where I'm seeing ownership go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Hopefully that's not what's happening here, that we're not just turning over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| and this is a fresh start with a brand-new ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| I'm hopeful of that, and I'm sure that's what other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| may be a little worried about, going a little heavier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| So I'm going to make a motion that we go $500 fine or 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Sir, is this, I believe you did buy it from a gentleman last year that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| and his wife had split or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| She sold it to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I don't know the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| I bought it from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| I don't know their situation, other than they weren't getting along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| And also, if I may, right before I bought it, I think there was, I don't know what you call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| a sting or whatever, and they did get a letter of accommodation because they passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| and they got a little pat on the back saying, good job from, I don't know if it was Wolfie or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| But we do want to do good business, and like I say, it's just my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| It was $494.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| I took the driver's license in the office, looked at it, and I just read it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| It's honestly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| We catch a lot of people if somebody isn't, not necessarily qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| but if we think they're drunk or anything, we've turned down people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| We've turned down sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Making a dollar on a six-pack isn't what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| We want to be there a long time and do good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| You said you took it inside to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Does your register read the card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| It does some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| We have a software that's called Comcache, and some of them it does and some of them it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| And I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| We have the newest version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| It's called Comcache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| And we've tried our own personal IDs, and it doesn't, it isn't 100% full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| I wish it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| We have these that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| We get these from the top shelf people where you lay it on top of your, where you put it over your driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=795)|
| 0:13:26| and can see the dates better, and we all have these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| But like I say, it was my mistake, nobody to blame but me, and I don't want it to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=809)|
| 0:13:39| I guess I got outvoted this time, but if this happens again, it may be more than 1,000 on the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Sir, you have a choice between a 30-day suspension or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Okay, you pay to the clerk's office within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| BP Food Mart, 3203 Maryville Pike, NICU Incorporated owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=844)|
| 0:14:18| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I'm Rashid Hirani, 3203 BP Food Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| 3203 Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Yes, that's Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| Mr. Hirani, I'll be calling the sheriff, the charging officer forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| He will give the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| You will have an opportunity to affirm or deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| at which time you'll have an opportunity to give this board your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| At this time, Captain May, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| On February 6, 2014, conducted an underage beer sting at the BP 3203 Old Maryville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=893)|
| 0:15:02| and bought a six-pack Bud Light lime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| and this gentleman is the owner that I purchased my underage purchase from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=905)|
| 0:15:14| Mr. Hirani, do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| I affirm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| At this time, it's your opportunity to give your side of the story to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| and I'll turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| This is the first time it's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I checked the ID, but it says 21-something, but I was suddenly phone came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| I was distracted, and, you know, it's my mistake, you know, the first time it's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=932)|
| 0:15:40| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Motion for a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| I don't want to necessarily direct it to this gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| but this is the first time since I've been on this beer board that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| the actual all of the people that came in were actually the people offending, the offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| You know, normally it's someone nebulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| So I'm sitting here trying to think whether that's a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| or do we have managers selling to underage if it's a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| I don't know right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| You know, we have managers and owners making these sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| They're standing up and coming before us, which I'm sure is not an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| However, this may be a disturbing trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| So I would hope that you not come before us again because this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| I'll say that over the last five years I've seen this body has rightfully gone a lot more heavy-handed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| with our punishments because we're committed to only having age-appropriate people consume alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| And that's just not only the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| It's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| There really aren't any excuses, you know, misreading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| So just more of an acknowledgment that we're getting the offenders in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1026)|
| 0:17:14| So we'll see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| How long have you had this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| And you've had a beer license the whole three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| And this is your first time getting, because we can only go back a couple of years on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| This is your first time getting caught?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| No, this is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Does your register read the cards, or are you depending on doing this all by eyesight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| No, we have the system, the Ruby system, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| Sometimes if you put the wrong key, so it's messed up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| It's my mistake, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| How many different kinds of these machines are there, Wolfie, the readers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| There's quite a few different companies that produce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| Some read well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Some don't read as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| It has a lot to do with the amount of money that you pay to get the readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| Well, maybe we need to start inspecting the readers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| and set some kind of guidelines that it has to pass before they can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| Just throwing that out for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| All right, we've got a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1121)|

| 0:18:45| Mr. Anani, you have a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Which do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| We've got to pay that within seven days to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1134)|

| 0:22:51| I'll be calling up the charging officer, and then you'll have an opportunity to reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1371)|

| 0:23:00| On February 6, 2014, conducted an underage beer sting at the Cargo, 8212 Chapman Highway, purchased two 25-ounce cans of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1380)|
| 0:23:14| Ms. Cannon, do you deny or affirm the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Would you like to tell your side of the story to the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| And I'll turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I've been manager there for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| We've gone through numerous stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| We offer a $50 bonus if you pass or you're fired immediately if you fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| Hence, our employee no longer works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| We also have he had entered in the correct birthday, and I guess just human fallible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| He, as human beings, were fallible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| I watched him on film, and he thinks, oh, I did something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Instead of, for some reason, not saying, this person's not old enough, he thought he had done something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and he entered a birthday a year that made it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| And he's been through the TIPS class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| I teach the TIPS class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| And I'm constantly, we remind, we talk about it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| We work really hard not to sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| We talk about, I'm constantly reminding them through either schedule notes or pass-on notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| I've since posted some notes, posted things to remind them, reminders to remind them that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1459)|
| 0:24:29| to make sure that, you know, we're not selling to someone under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| And also we work hard to watch for people who may be impaired in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| And also, excuse me, I'd always kind of put emphasis on checking the expiration date as the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1477)|
| 0:24:47| And so that was probably my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Now I'm putting the emphasis on the red box with the under 21 and making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| And they have copies of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| These are two different licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| One is underage and one is not so that they can have an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| And that's just what we've done since to prevent this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1502)|
| 0:25:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Make a motion to assess $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| We'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| We've got to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| So we have a first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I do appreciate your incentive program, the $50 gift or firing, which is not an incentive, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| It's a decent on the firing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| But I do appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| We stressed that at the beginning of it when I trained them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| It's stressed very heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| We've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1546)|

| 0:25:50| You said you've been there eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Have you had a violation in those eight years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I was going to make a comment that the chairman made a moment ago about the incentive that you've offered here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| Those of you that are here today applying for a license, you might want to consider this because it seems to have worked for her for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1565)|
| 0:26:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1579)|

| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Sir, you have a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Which do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| I accept $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| You have to pay it within seven days of the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Well, if we just real quick before we move on to the application stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| this represents we've got several people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| You've got five that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| So, in a month's time, how many people will you check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| and they don't have a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Give us an idea how many people that you – is it 50, 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| I mean, how many people do you all check a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Because Lost County is spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| I can drive 100 miles and check 25 to 35 places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| This particular night I checked 19 and cited six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| So, due to having to write all the citations out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| I filled up my allotted time with my underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| Several of the people, some of the people this morning, this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| have said something about they didn't check the date right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| But one of the offendants said something about a red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| Now, the license ID that the cadet is carrying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| what's the correct title for the person that's making the purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| We call them undercover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| The undercover person that is making the purchase, is there a red line, a red box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| or what is on the driver's license that identifies them being underage without checking anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| Every person from age 16 to age 20, on the side of their picture there's a red line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| and inside that it says under the age of 21 until June 4, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| They don't even have to look at the issue date or the expiration date or the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| It automatically tells them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| It's Tennessee law that all of their driver's licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and there's intermediate, regular license when they turn 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| but everything will have a red line beside their picture, and it's bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| I mean, it's probably a quarter-inch strip of red with the under 21 until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| So there's no way that you can not know that that person handed you a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| It tells you if they're either over 21 or under 21 simply by reading the red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| So I guess where Commissioner Brown and I are going to sit on this is he was a little bit harsher today than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| I guess it's because we had all the offendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| The person that would stand in front of us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| I just miscalculated really has done two things wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| They're colorblind also then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I've attended the tips class that all of the servers and the people that sell go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| They spend about 30 minutes talking about the red stripe with a birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| So if you've been through the tips class, they've talked about the red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I did not want to flavor the conversations that we had today with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| because we were midway through the list whenever one of the employers said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1931)|
| 0:32:19| if it has a red mark on it, they deny it out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| For instance, if you turn 21 on June 4th this year, on a red stripe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| it'll say under 21 until June 4th, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| If you go get your driver's license the day before they expire, which a lot of people do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| that red stripe will still be on there if you're under 21, if you're just one day from 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| But it'll say under 21 until June 4th, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| So my advice to people that are selling alcoholic beverage would be to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| if it has a red mark on it, deny it out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| And if the purchaser wants to say, I am 21, that would be the time then to check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Well, if you got your driver's license before your 21st birthday, it's going to have a red stripe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| but it's going to say when you turn 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Most people, when their licenses start to expire, they'll get them a week early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Or if they wait until the day of and they get caught at a traffic stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| they're going to be cited for no driver's license because they've expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| So most people get them at turn 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Right before they turn 21, they're going to get the driver's license that still has the red stripe on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| I think you answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| You can keep your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| So it doesn't expire when they turn 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| So if they get it at 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| they could potentially be walking around for a couple of years with that red stripe driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| But it will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| But it will say, I turned 21 a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| That license will expire on their 21st birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| So that license does expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| What I was trying to explain was if they go the week before, they'll get another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| It's still going to have a red stripe on it, but it's going to say when they turn 21, which is the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2078)|

| 0:36:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Move to approve pending surrender of license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2202)|

| 0:36:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2206)|

| 0:36:48| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| We also have to have a registration for a tax ID number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| I have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| You have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| You'll have to turn that into the clerk's office before they'll issue your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| And surrender the other license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2221)|

| 0:37:05| I'm going to go ahead and state the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| This is an on-off premise beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| This carries with it a lot more liability than just an off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| You understand what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| And you understand what you're liable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| You're going to get checked a lot harder versus just having an off or an on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2245)|

| 0:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2255)|

| 0:38:04| the same ones that you heard that were asked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| You will have to answer these to the beer boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| and let them know states where they understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| When I'm through, I will turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2293)|

| 0:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Do you have a partner or interest in this business, a corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Who will be operating this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I will be managing the stores, but I have a manager in place and they will be running it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2350)|

| 0:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2358)|

| 0:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| I've got a few questions, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Looking back at the history of this address, in July of 2005, I guess Mr. Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| Lewis Wright, and in October of 2008, your corporation took the business over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| In January of 2009, which, mind you, is three months later, committed the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| In May of 2013, another first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I guess the time had lapsed before you could count them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| In that same month, your father, I believe, Liberty Markets Incorporated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| That is not my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| So no family relation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| And the same corporation that owned it back in 2008 up to 2013 is repurchasing the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| releasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Yes, Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| I still own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| I've owned it ever since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| And I bought it from Juan Sanders in 2008 on October 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| And I've ever since owned the real estate and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I just decided to lease it out last year because I have other stores in other areas, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| other counties and the city limits in Maryville and Lenoir City and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| So I just wanted to take some time off and I leased it out to Liberty Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| That is Abdullah Kanjani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| And he's no cousin or, you know, no kin to me, no family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| I decided to lease it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| It was a two-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| And the reputation just went down, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| And I had a lot of complaints and calls, you know, from these stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| And the customers kept calling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I gave him a couple of warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| It didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| And I just bought it back, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I guess what I want to emphasize to you, that May of 2013, that first offense follows you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| It may be a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| But I think in our eyes it may or may not follow you on the enforcement that we put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Ms. Hunt, would you excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| She's about to leave and I want to tell her about her package over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| Can you hang out just a minute, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Hang just two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| We have a motion and a second, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2503)|

| 0:42:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| That was my fault, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2527)|

| 0:42:59| but he's mentioned where he said he's got other stores in other areas and decided to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2579)|

| 0:43:08| And he's trying to be a community member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| He's helped with some of the non-profits in the community and doing that willingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| But as Commissioner Andrews has said, if something happens from here on out, it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| probably the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| If you see somebody wanting Bud Light, I'd be Leary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| Well, ever since the first offense in 2009, you know, incentive program that we give out $200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| to whoever passes the beer sting, and, you know, we haven't had any problem since 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| We wish you good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Any other business before the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| This meeting is adjourned just for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Are we having the public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| It's coming at 445, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Yes, the assistant band director is coming at 445 because all the kids, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| are going to be in practice after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| So, unfortunately, they can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Okay, let's reconvene at 150 for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2644)|
| 0:44:15| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| I've seen her recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I wonder why she did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| That's why she sends you that to make sure you're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Please don't fire me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2663)|

| 0:45:26| I'll just give you one more chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| The consideration of trouble and wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2727)|

| 0:45:32| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Please rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| It's all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| We have and hour for the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| An honorary resolution will be at 445, so I'm going to go ahead and call roll for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Hello, Mr. Presley. You'll have your name and address. You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| My name is Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| My first statement is I learned something from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| He said if a man can't find something to fight for, he's not fit to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| I'm here to fight for the school system. I'm here to fight for these teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| It's sad that you all don't support Dr. McIntyre and his plans and Hazlum's plan to evaluate teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2765)|
| 0:46:14| How can you have a young teacher evaluate a teacher been in the system as long as they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| That's a joke. You need to get somebody in there that got the profession, that knows what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| and that really care about the kids and then they care about the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| And then how are you going to have youth county and city officials get your kids going to private schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| but then you want to make decisions on what public schools do with this 50 percent of the county's money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| If your kid's so good to go to Webb, leave him at Webb, but don't make no decisions as to what we do at West Hills Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| Leave him over there. Let him continue to go to Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Let him continue to look good, picking him up and dropping him off every morning at a nice facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| But they don't want to bring him here to speak up for us. That's no excuse for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| And then Dr. McIntyre, he wants to support this system evaluating the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| This 2 percent that raised you gave these teachers, that 2 percent don't even pay the gas bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| Them 180 days that they're trying to extend, that's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| If the kids can't have some teachers, if you don't let the teachers teach them in that 180 days, then get some new teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| You go out there and teach your kids, but then you want to make decisions for these teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| These teachers are busting their butt to make sure these kids got the materials and the things they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| and they're spending it out of their own pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| They're asking you all to give them no extra money, which you all should volunteer to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| And Mayor Burchett, he's about the only good guy up there because he was out there when we had them snow days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| riding in the trucks at 4 o'clock in the morning, helping push out that salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Where were you guys, sleeping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| You need to get up there and show up to these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| And that lady, Lynn Fugate, who you all had on this so-called retreat, that was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| She won't even return phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| And I heard this from one of the state reps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| I'm going to call them to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| And that Canfield, if you're not going to show up at these schools, do like he do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| Just use your power and don't do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| But the best state official we got seems to be Burchett and Steve Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| I called Steve Hill 930 one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| That man called me back, and we talked for over an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| That Lynn Fugate lady, she's supposed to be a school board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| She needs to get out of that chair and get her butt over to these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| and eat some of that nasty lunch you all are feeding our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| It ain't going to hurt her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| But, no, she's too good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| She want to eat with you guys and go back behind the curtains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| and make all these good decisions for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Let the kids know that you care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| And as far as Sam McKenzie, I refereed football with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| Hell, he was making bad calls in them days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| He still making bad calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Because he made so bad, I threw a flag on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| He told me, we refereed Fulton and Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| And he came up and told me, pick that flag up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| You don't throw no penalty flag against Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| And I threw another one on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| You know, if you're going to do your job, do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Get your butt from up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Him and Daniel Brown, I don't trust neither one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| We're trying to get to NOVA, not to build a hospital in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| And what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| They lie to us and tell us they're not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| And what happened to NOVA getting ready to dig the ground up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| They probably gave you all a shovel with gold on it just for your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| The city already told them they could dig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| But, again, let the teachers teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| I've talked to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| I've been going to Kroger's and Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| And I've been asking people, are you a teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| She said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Please mention that we need materials to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Please mention that these principals are putting pressure on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Please mention that a teacher with two years' experience can't evaluate a teacher with 25 years' experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=2991)|
| 0:50:00| And you all supporting that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Okay, Mr. Presley, we've got a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| If you can wrap it up, 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Well, to wrap it up here, let the teachers teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Let's have a good community and get y'all butts from up there and show up at these schools sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| That's all I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Can Sam have his flags?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| Mine's a lot cleaner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| Thank you, Mr. Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| A little levity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Mr. Presley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Mr. Presley, you do realize that we're not, this commission is not the one dictating the evaluation of these teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3037)|
| 0:50:50| That's the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Yeah, and from what I heard from some state officials, they say, this is what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| He said, we're not going to meddle in the school board business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| We're going to let the school board do their business, and the school board is not going to meddle in our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| So you all don't want to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| No, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| The state law prohibits us from doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| But I guarantee you, if we could, we'd be right in the middle of it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Let me tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Well, how come you make that give them 53% of the county's money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| If you're giving them money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Mr. Brown, can you continue this conversation with me later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you, Mr. Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Give me your five minutes, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| Ms. Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| It's a tough act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| I don't have any flags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Name and address for your record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Carolyn Greenwood, 3224 Boomerang Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| I'm here today to tell you about some concerns that residents have in Carnes and to ask for advice and for assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Carnes is one of the fastest-growing areas in Knox County, and it's poised to continue to grow for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| Conveniently located between Knoxville and Oak Ridge, Carnes is bound to continue to grow and change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| yet so far it has still managed to keep its small-town vibe, as one resident said, and it's still got a lot of natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| It's a really beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| If you don't go up there, you ought to take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| But over the last couple of weeks, something has happened that causes us a lot of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| and has got us wondering about what lies in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| A very large billboard, and I've got handouts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Is there somebody to help me with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| I don't think I have enough for everybody, but it's probably close if we just do the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3150)|
| 0:52:40| The picture is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| It doesn't do it justice as much as if you were standing there and seeing it over this tiny building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| But there's a very large billboard capable of carrying two ads at about a 90-degree angle to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| It was constructed right in the heart of Carnes just in the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| It's at an intersection known by everybody as the Carnes Red Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| It's right at the heart of our community, and it's called that because that's where the first traffic signal went in in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| The sign dwarfs the small building below it where a florist business just opened up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| and it's a clear case of visual blight due to the oversized sign not fitting in with the scale of the rest of the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| The concern of the community has been reflected in a Facebook group that I started a couple of years ago called I Love Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| And I started it because I sensed a bit of an inferiority complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| and some trauma on the part of the community that was being torn apart by a new school that was being built in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3209)|
| 0:53:37| It was sucking away some of our best teachers and resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| and the school and community of Carnes were being criticized as being inferior to Farragut and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| It has so much to offer, though, that I started that as kind of a rallying cry for Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| When faced with a common threat like this billboard, they have rallied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| There were about 200 members on the group for about the last couple of years since I started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| And then recently, this year and the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| it started growing as the Butler Farm and the Carnes Connector and some of these other issues came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| And we've got almost 500 members now from 200 just less than a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| So I know that people are interested and concerned, and they're shocked by how quickly changes can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| and are especially distressed when they didn't know it was going to happen until it was too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| So I'm here to ask you what we can do to grow in a positive way that would benefit business and residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| and rather than a haphazard and ugly way that benefits nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| The Northwest County Sector Plan that I handed out just a page of to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| There's a lot of other good stuff in there, but I just didn't want to make a lot of copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| But it lays out a wonderful plan for Carnes over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| It identifies a Carnes overlay district that includes a vision of a pedestrian-friendly area at the Carnes red light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| architectural design guidelines, uniform sign criteria, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| Who is supposed to bring these plans to fruition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| This plan is really old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| That sector plan is overdue for being renewed, and I think they're supposed to work on it this year again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| But that's been around for a long time, and we're not seeing progress in those directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| I know it's a long-term plan, but still we ought to be moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| And if we don't move quickly, we're going to have billboards and all these other things that we can't control ruining our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| We participated in the planning process for that sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| but it seems there's no guidance or follow-up on making the plan a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| We're not planners, but we know what's right and what's wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| and this billboard seems to be a sign of something going wrong in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Please help us to help Carnes live up to its great potential as outlined in our sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| Help us get design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Tell us what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| We're not the planners, but we know they're out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| and we need to somehow get them engaged to help our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| I happen to see Mark Donaldson sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| Mark, you want to come on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| I hate to put you on the spot, but can you, because this is not my area, particular area of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3359)|
| 0:56:11| and I know about sector plan changes and updates and the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| can you just kind of inform us as to where this community is along this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| and the next steps that need to be taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Because it occurs to me that you would be the one with the knowledge about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| We've established in our work program for this fiscal year the start of sector plan updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| for the northwest city sector and the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| Concurrently, we are wrapping up central city and east city sector plan updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| Those will be coming forward within a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| This year we're starting with the background studies, documenting data changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| census data changes over the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| The most recent update to the northwest county sector plan was done several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| with the Pellissippi Parkway corridor land use plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| So we have done area-specific updates to the general northwest county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| within the last several years, but we are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| starting the process to do a general update of the entire sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| And when is the time for public input into that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| Once we complete the background studies, we will go out to the public with a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| and some general meetings on the front end of the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| And then once we collect information from the surveys and from public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| we will make recommendations and have another wave of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| So over the next 10 to 12 months, there will be two series of public input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| And how do you notify the public about those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| We work with the groups that we know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| We do some general advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| but we're most effective working through the groups that we know that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| The West County Association of Homeowners Associations is a good starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3504)|
| 0:58:35| I'm sorry, pull the microphone down there, Carolyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| I'm sorry, it's just we're not getting to the real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| We did all that last time, and we'll do it again, even though we're discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| But we want to know when those things actually start to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| How do we get design guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| How do we make this vision happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| We can do plans and we can do plans and we can do plans, but that's not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| We don't need plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| We need some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| So, Mark, if I'm understanding this correctly, the last time that this was done was how many years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3536)|
| 0:59:06| I believe it's been 10 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Okay, so it's time to redo them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| There will be opportunities for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| and then after the design plans and guidelines are in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| they go to MPC for adoption and then to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Okay, so there's going to be two opportunities for public input coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| and then after the plan is done, it goes before MPC and then to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| And then it would be put into place, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Well, keep in mind that a plan is basically a series of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| Our sector plan updates include a component on future land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| so we adopt a future land use map that guides future zoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3588)|
| 0:59:56| We also have a section on public facilities that are required in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| so we will have lists of parks, sidewalks, greenways, libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| all of the public facilities that should be there to accommodate the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| and projected populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| And then quite often we will have a series of recommendations on various tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| to implement the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Okay, so what I'm hearing you say, and please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| but what I'm hearing you say is that there will be action taken over the next fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| in regards to updating the sector plan and getting those guidelines put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| but that you may not see any results until actual development starts to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| based on the updated sector plan and guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| With regard to zoning, certainly the future land use plan provides a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| and guidance for any individual request to change the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| With regard to tools to implement various recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| that takes the initiative of this body, the County Commission, to pass ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| to codify those recommendations into the zoning ordinance or into the code of ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| or into the building codes and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| Adopting the plan does not adopt the ordinances that implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| Okay, but those come from MPC to County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| They can come from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| We do periodically bring forward ordinance recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| and we have probably limited success in getting those adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| Carolyn, does that answer some of your questions as to timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| Yeah, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I mean, there's no reason why they can't be acting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| You know, things are happening all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| and I would like to know if there's any way we can have some control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| over where the billboards go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| I know that there was a ban that has been allowed to lapse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| but even just in terms of placement, you know, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| But I'm also wondering about the Carnes Overlay District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| Are we an overlay district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Do we have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| What does it take to become one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| I don't think we should have to wait for it to again be enacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| or maybe to be taken away in this next go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| We've got a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| There is no Carnes Overlay District at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Within the county's zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| there's the Technology Corridor Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| which does not extend as far away from Pellissippi Parkway as Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| It does include some of the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| and there's historic zoning overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Those are the two overlay districts that have been created to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| The city's zoning ordinance, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| is a little more robust in terms of the overlays that have been enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| ranging from infill housing to the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| But a suggestion in the plan does not create an overlay zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| That has to be a very specific process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| and it's generally very strong on the planning side to get people to buy in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| to the concepts that are being codified in the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| So it's not something that happens automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| with the approval of a sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Well, I hear and understand Carolyn's frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| Is there any recommendations that you would have at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| Well, certainly to participate in the sector plan update process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| and to be as specific as possible about the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| that are incorporated into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| And the more momentum you can build through the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| the more likely it is to get implementation codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| I didn't think you'd get any further than that, so I guess I'm satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| But I would like to see some progress made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| There are things that UT sometimes does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| I wonder if we would benefit from being part of a study that graduate students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| or something could participate in to come up with a vision or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| I don't know if the commission can get involved in that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| and I guess I need to talk to Brad since you're our representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| But I know they do that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| I think there's a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| They tell us something about smart communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| and there's a deadline for Friday or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| So I think we may have missed this go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| But maybe it takes something like that to get a clearer vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| We don't know how to be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| We don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| We're not planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| We look to them, and it's obvious that we're going to have to find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| to get more specific before they do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| Well, I think that you probably have more knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| than you're giving yourself credit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| and that you're specific about where you want billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| and where you don't want billboards, and that's as good a place to start as any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Is that something that we can approach the commission about, or who's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| That would be up to the law director, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| I mean, you all let that lapse, and I guess that was a conscious decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Well, I can't comment on what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| But as far as the planning process, what the sector plan does is create a broad vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| and you're trying to get down to the implementation level of it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| And that is where private developers come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| and that sector plan holds them to a certain standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| And you're right now pointing out a standard that evidently you have some concerns about, which is billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| Then you, at that level, you can talk to your representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| who will then work with the planning commission or this body to try to enact issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| that you want addressed through ordinances or so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| If that's not specifically what it is you're trying to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| well, it will go to the planning commission first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| or they come here and they send it to the planning commission for a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| then it comes back to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| But talking about the existing sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| it is a guidance for MPC to use when they're looking at rezoning requests and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| I've seen how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| I'm not all optimistic about that either because it just got changed so simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| But I'm wondering, and I don't want to take a lot more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I know that we need to get finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| But I'm wondering about it sounds like a chicken and an egg problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| because we want to establish guidelines before business comes in so they know what they're going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| But you're saying you can't get specific until somebody wants to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| I'm saying MPC gets specific when people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| You can get specific with your plans and approach your representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| Then the process can start there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| and you can work through county commission in cooperation with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| and develop a process just like they did with the issues related to beer boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| and the electronic signage and all that stuff in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| That started off with your community going to your representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| then working with the planning commission and coming up with some more stringent, specific rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| That's different than the sector plan, which is a broad guideline which MPC uses to zone or rezone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| That helps some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| I do appreciate you listening and appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Nobody else has signed up for public forum, so we'll move right into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| The primary resolution we're going to put off until 445 for forum, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4069)|
| 1:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4081)|

| 1:08:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| And for the devotionals, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Actually, we got mixed up this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| And I'm doing devotional and he's doing the pledge to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| So I have to say I gave a great deal of thought to this month's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| You know, I figured leading you all in a series of sun salutation yoga poses was probably not the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| So I'm just going to share with all of you what's in my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| And I did write it down and edit it for time, which I'm sure that you're appreciative of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| but I know you'll give me the consideration of a couple more minutes in the standard prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| I would say, Sam, you bring a fresh perspective to every issue that comes before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| We can go around the table and talk something to death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| and then you always seem to come at it from a direction that none of the rest of us even noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| This is a gift, and I love you, and I love you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| Tony, you have such a capacity for love and compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| and I admire your commitment to your faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| and your commitment to filling out pages and pages of notes during discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| I love you, and I love having you sit next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Jeff, I admire your tremendous heart and your commitment to your family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| and to those who share your political views, even though they usually differ from mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| And I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Rick, you're one of the hardest-working people I have ever met in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| and yet you still found time to square off against me over a cup of coffee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| or come down and teach my Brownie Scouts about bees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Bud, I admire your commitment to protecting the county and its employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| and your commitment to keeping us in line and occasionally for making fools of ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Larry, although you and I have had a rough spot recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| I'll never forget that you always come to visit me in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| you always check on me when I'm not feeling well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| and you always find time to celebrate our birthdays together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| And I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Brad, I really admire how much you've grown during your time on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| It's been very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| I find you to be thoughtful and reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| and you also have the best giggle I've ever heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| And I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Women of the clerk's office, you hang in there with us during long meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| and you read interminable consent agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| yet every time I look over there at you all, you're smiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| And you also keep me company in the downstairs bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| And I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Dave, you are the epitome of a gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| You're gentle and you're kind and you're considerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| to every person you come into contact with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Mike Brown, you have got such a quirky sense of humor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| that even when I should be really, really mad at you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| I just can't sustain it for very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| I love to look over and see you chuckling, and it always makes me laugh too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| And I love you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Mike Hammond, I admire your grasp of and your interest in all sorts of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| that are beyond whatever we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| in addition to the things we are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| And you always make yourself available to me to answer any question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| from parenting to county finance to basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| And I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Ed, what I admire most about you is your willingness to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| and the fact that you never, ever raise your voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| or show any agitation during heated debates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| You're a role model for me in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| And I have never, ever heard you utter an unkind word about anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| And I think you're about the only person that I've ever met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| that I can say that about, and I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| And Jolie, Jill, David, and John, as well as Daniel and Drew who are upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| without you our meetings would be a train wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| You make sure we have and have access to all the information we need to do good work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| and you're always good-natured about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| regardless of what we drop in your laps in the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| I'm also grateful for the nourishment prepared for the women inmates downstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| and those who deliver it up to us, and I want to express my love for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| Also, for the media who are here every month keeping us on our toes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| and making certain that what we do here is accurately reported to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| Our mayor, our department heads, and employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| it is because of you that our government works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| and I appreciate the time you spend here with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| and the dedication you bring to your jobs, and I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| And for the members of the public who watch from home or work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| or who are able to come be here with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| I appreciate your commitment to being informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4396)|

| 1:13:28| And although it isn't always apparent by my words and my actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| every time I look into the eyes of each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| I see a manifestation of the divine sacred, and I am blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4417)|

| 1:13:55| Commissioner Norman with the pledge of the flag, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Okay. Would you rise and salute our flag, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4447)|

| 1:15:09| and I want to meet with them before we have a discussion or vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4509)|

| 1:16:09| and we didn't have any comments there, but Mr. Brown wasn't here and Mr. Hammond wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| So I just wanted to put that back on just in case they might have something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4577)|

| 1:16:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| We're going to sign it a number and add that to the agenda on a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| So it's a permanent stormwater easement for what subdivision is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| Westland, Rofield at Westland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4605)|

| 1:17:07| Just a question on what we just discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Can we add that without a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| We're about to vote on it now, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| You can assign one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| We'll have to assign one to it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| Jill will take care of that piece administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| If you'll add something to it, and you'll have to do it based upon whatever Mr. Vanderveet has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4645)|
| 1:17:35| Do we have a copy of anything, Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| We have the paperwork in-house, and Mr. Roberts has reviewed it, and it's in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| I can e-mail it to everybody, but I'm not sure what it's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| It's not going to bring you a whole lot of value while you're down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Stormwater to subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| I just want to be proper, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4672)|

| 1:18:00| Now, whether you have clarity to vote on it and accept it or not is up to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| I can't comment on proceeding from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| I guess I'll just ask, what are the hazards of bringing this up next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| Is there a contract that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| The property has been sold, and because there is a change in ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4696)|
| 1:18:23| the recording of this hadn't taken place because it was going to record to the prior owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| and it's going to, in this case, record to the name of the buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| So it's pretty standard stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| It just came in at the 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| We normally are pretty resistant to adding these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| but in this case it was going to be pretty much a showstopper for the transaction on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| We had discussed it with Commissioner Anders that the mechanics of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| from the stormwater standpoint, are fully in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| Ordinarily we would prefer that it go through the normal committee process and normal examination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| but in this case we hate it to be an impediment to the sale of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=4737)|

| 1:29:40| and tell the commission what Regal has already put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5380)|

| 1:29:52| Regal Cinemas has been planning for some time to implement a pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| to connect our campus and halls with the Halls Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| to give our 400-some-odd corporate employees access to the Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| and all the points that it then connects to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| such as the Halls Community Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| and a shopping center in another direction in several neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| And we've been studying this for some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| and working with various county departments to study the feasibility and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| And we're appreciative of the commission's approval of an opportunity to connect to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5428)|
| 1:30:36| and take advantage of that amenity for our corporate employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5439)|

| 1:30:43| and others and Daniel Sanders for working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| And I appreciate the investment because it's well over $100,000 what Regal is basically donating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| I know your employees will use a lot of it, but we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Mr. Hatfield, I'd like to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Anything you'd like to say, Ted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5457)|

| 1:31:02| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| I think this is a win-win for everybody, for the county, for the Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| for the merchants in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| and for probably some of those 400 and some odd employees of ours that need a little bit more exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5471)|

| 1:32:12| regarding the transfer of the properties and easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| and approving the sale by Knott's County, Tennessee, to Rufus H. Smith, Jr. & Company, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5535)|

| 1:32:32| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| I really want to take an opportunity here just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| I know that we always give kudos to the directors of the offices, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| Hugh and Dwight and Bud Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| But the folks that worked really hard on this were Tom Salter and Charlie Sturkey and Carrie Smitherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| It was a deal that was off the table, and then we got everybody back together and brought it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| And I appreciate the hard work they've done in the last month to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| What, in essence, this does is we found a piece of property and we're swapping some of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| and then we're selling some of our forks of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| And with this land deal, we'll be able to build two convenience centers for the price of one virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| And so I do appreciate the work that the employees did on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| So, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5601)|

| 1:33:31| and a half or so ago I was asking why we could not get some work done at the Carter Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| And I was told that I should visit the Carnes Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| And I came back with a report that said, yes, there are two convenience centers needed in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5620)|
| 1:33:47| and Carter's number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| The plan that is in place before us fixes both convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| helps a lot of people both in private and public to get Knox County on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5639)|

| 1:34:49| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| Yes, I'm just going to reiterate that I think this is a solution in need of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5693)|
| 1:35:00| We've got our urban growth boundary that clearly delineates areas that are annexable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5700)|
| 1:35:11| I guess that's the proper word for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| And that what we've seen in the past, where this may have been coming from, is far in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5714)|
| 1:35:23| We've not seen it recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| Don't see a need for it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| If this is a response to what's going on in the other communities, I'm going to remind everyone again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| and we'll take the opportunity again in the future when it presents itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| that as a home rural county, we like to decide for ourselves, not have Nashville tell us how to conduct our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5739)|
| 1:35:49| So, you know, there are two sides to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| So I see people going back and forth on whatever side of that best supports their particular position at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5752)|
| 1:36:01| So that's something that I would like for all of us to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Commissioner, let me remind you one more time, that is not what we're here to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| All we're saying to vote on today is if you're going to be annexed, that you have the right to vote yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| or no if you want to be annexed, pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| Do you want to address the commission, Mr. Andrew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| I am D.H. Andy Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| I live at 712 Summit Lake Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| I come before you today specifically to address the resolution you're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| I have one question, one reminder, one invitation, and one conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5804)|
| 1:36:53| First, with regard to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| how can any legislator elected to represent the citizens fail or refuse to support the citizens' right to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5816)|
| 1:37:06| when threatened with forced annexation into a city by which they do not consent to be governed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5826)|
| 1:37:15| Now, as for a reminder, I remind you that before you took your office as commissioners of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5835)|
| 1:37:23| you took an oath to the effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| I do solemnly swear that I will support, obey, and defend the Constitution of the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, and the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5853)|
| 1:37:41| I invite your attention to that charter, specifically the preamble, which reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5861)|
| 1:37:49| We, the people of Knox County, Tennessee, in order to establish a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| and to enlarge the powers of our county government, to enlarge the powers of our county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5874)|
| 1:38:08| In conclusion, folks, what has ever done more to diminish the powers of our county government than abusive annexation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5888)|
| 1:38:22| Folks, it is not what I think or not what others throw out in terms of red herrings and obfuscation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5902)|
| 1:38:32| Recognize, commissioners, your oath of office demands support for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5912)|
| 1:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Thank you, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| You know, I just want to remind everyone that I, as a citizen of Knoxville, as a citizen of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| and every one of my constituents are 100% fully vested in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| We're citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| We pay every bit, the sales tax and the property tax, that our counterparts in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5940)|
| 1:39:09| So, you know, again, I'm not going to support this resolution because I think what it's saying is we don't want to do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| We don't want to read that charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| We want the state to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| We did what we were supposed to do as county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| We created a process through MPC as county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| That's what we did at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| But this is saying Nashville solved our problems for us to certain people's satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| So, again, I guess I'll just, I need to keep reiterating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| I'm every bit as much of a citizen of Knox County as someone in Carnes, Carter, Powell, wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| So, you know, this doesn't diminish if they annex 200,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5991)|
| 1:39:58| You know, those 200,000 people are still members of Knox County, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| So, I guess I just, I think that gets lost in this conversation sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| And I just, as a representative that has 100% of his, in this case, he is a constituent boarded by the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6009)|
| 1:40:19| I just want to make that point whenever I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6024)|

| 1:42:45| No one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| All right, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Discussion regarding the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| About a month ago, our rules committee met for about two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| Ms. Jill from the law department has gone through the big thick rules booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| And between her and her assistants, Mr. Armstrong and David Buick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6188)|
| 1:43:18| there was a lot of minor verbiage changes and so forth that needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| So we pretty much had to go through it page by page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| That we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| We got down to the point of we're going to need at least one more meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| of discussing whether that we want to have the committees on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6213)|
| 1:43:42| or on a term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| So if you have any comments to that in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| you want to get to the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| And I would suggest that the committee on committees, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| look at that and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| we need to have these committees, you know, for the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| or do we want to do them annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| And also can you serve as chair of more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| Since we cut down to 11, you know, we were running out of chairs pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| So those are some of the things that we need to finalize yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| before we bring this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| So if you have any comments on those things, regarding those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| get them to the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| And if it's agreeable with the rules committee, I'd like to meet, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6269)|
| 1:44:37| one o'clock before the workshop next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| That will give us an hour and try to finish up some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| Is that agreeable with the rest of the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| that we will meet then at one o'clock on March the whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| If you have any suggestions, post them on the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| instead of getting them to the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| One o'clock on the next work session, whatever the work session is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| Any other discussion involving rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Discussion regarding compensation for public works employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| during inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Mr. Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| And I brought this up in light of our recent inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| And Dwight is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| And I'm going to ask Dwight to step down to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| And this was in no way intended to imply that there's something wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| or that there's anything, you know, illegal about the way we're compensating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Now, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| My concern is that these are some of our lowest paid workers in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| They come in on days that everyone else gets to be at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| And they're doing some of the most dangerous work out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| as evidenced by pictures we've seen in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| So my concern is that they, not that we aren't following the labor laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6363)|
| 1:46:10| as we are, but I would like to see a change in policy where they get time and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6370)|
| 1:46:21| on days that they have to come in and work during inclement weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| and do this dangerous work when everyone else gets to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| We're not talking about a huge sum of money here because these are so few workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| and because they are, in fact, some of the lowest paid workers in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| So that was my concern and why I wanted to bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| And I would love to hear other people's perspectives on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| and give Dwight an opportunity to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| And I know we're in budget discussions right now, if this would be a good place to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6408)|
| 1:46:55| see if we can fold that in, if it's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| So it's just those are my thoughts and my feelings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| and I'm interested to hear, you know, the perspective of everyone else as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| Go ahead, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Commissioner Broyles had brought this to my attention last week and had inquired about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| And if I can, if I can give you just a thumbnail explanation about how we handle these things now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| then after that I think it's a policy matter that's best left to the commission and the mayor to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| We do pay overtime to highway department employees when they're called in after hours for severe weather response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| Most of the time, obviously, that's in the winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| but every now and then when we get severe storms in summer months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| and we have a lot of trees down across the road and things like that, they'll actually work then, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| It really only gets complicated in a week when we, for instance, have a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| I used last week as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| It's just a useful one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| You have President's Day on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| The employees will be off on President's Day, off on Monday like all the other county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| They come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| They work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| And then Saturday morning it snows, and we bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| The Fair Labor Standards Act provides that overtime is paid over and above 40 hours worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| In a case like that, a situation like the week with President's Day, they've been paid for 40 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| but they've only worked 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| So those first eight hours on Saturday are paid at straight time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| and then as soon as they cross that 40-hour threshold Saturday afternoon, then time and a half kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| We've had employees question the fairness of it on and off over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| but the reality is that that is the standard that's outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| and we rely on a publication from CTAS that gives us guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| as well as conversations with Mark Jones and Colonel Julian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| So I hope that's a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| Commissioner Broyles had asked me if it was possible to, I don't want to use the word supersede,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| but if you viewed that Fair Labor Standards Act as a minimum standard, could the commission adopt something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| And the short answer to that is I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| We've never contemplated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| But we only pay overtime after 40 hours worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| So in cases where you have a holiday and it's not 40 hours worked but 40 hours paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| you still have to get across that 40 hours worked threshold in order for time and a half to kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| I hope that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| Dwight, thank you for the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| I was going to ask you for that first, but I wanted to, and I was not here at the workshop last week to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| but I guess maybe this is a better time to do it today, is to congratulate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| and your crews, your road crews, for the excellent job they did during this past snowstorm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6586)|
| 1:49:55| And over the last four or five years that I've been up here, I've noticed that it just keeps getting better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| I mean, whether it's trees down across the road, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| I've never seen response like we're getting in my lifetime that we have in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| And I just want you to know that I appreciate it, and I'm sure that everybody in my district appreciates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| And I'd always be remiss if I didn't mention your Director of Highway Maintenance is Mr. Brian Hubbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| and much of the credit for innovations in route planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| and the delivery of equipment and materials to the districts throughout the county are ideas that Brian has brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| He's been in the job about three years now, and he just continues to raise the bar every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| I guess my question is a little on my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Maybe I see Chris out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| And we are really not talking about a lot of money, like I said, in terms of on the per hour basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| But I guess one of the things I think Commissioner Burroughs was getting to, you know, they're kind of like first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6661)|
| 1:51:09| They're going in the opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| When folks are running home to get their bread and eggs to hunker down, our folks are going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| So in terms of county employees, when the county employees are off, they're just off work, you all get compensated for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6677)|
| 1:51:25| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| To me, that would be a time to get time and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| And I think if you look to the law department and the fair labor standards, I think we can go above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| I think they kind of have a minimum set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| I mean, over the past five years I've been on there, we've probably closed the county offices ten days maybe in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6700)|
| 1:51:49| I'm probably giving a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| So we're not talking about a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| We're talking about a handful of people getting half more than they would normally get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| But that to me is a ñ and, again, it's nothing for us to decide, something for the mayor's office to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| But, you know, the mayor's been out there on those trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| It's been well documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| You know, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| It's moving in the opposite direction to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| They could, should be compensated at a higher level than someone like us sitting at home weathering the storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6732)|
| 1:52:22| when they're out there trying to make things a little safer for us as county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| So that's just something I would encourage them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| I want to reiterate what Commissioner Brown was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Commissioner Brown, it's gotten a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| So, Dwight, I'd like ten gallons of brine, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| I was going to ask, Chris, did you have anything you wanted to add to this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| Sam had mentioned my name, so I decided to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| No, if the mayor and HR and engineering decide to do anything, I mean, we can look at it as far as a budget impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| and that wouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| And I want to make clear what I'm asking for for time and a half is not just that strict overtime, but for the 40-hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| you know, however hours it is that they put in, not just their regular work hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| in addition to any overtime that particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6794)|
| 1:53:22| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| Discussion regarding the status of the Sheriff Department's salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| Chris, we need you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6809)|
| 1:53:38| Sorry, Chris, I should have kept you down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| Are there any updates on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| I think I talked to Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| Dr. Lu, who does our survey, is doing the Sheriff's Department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| And I think he told us maybe April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| Is that what he told us, Colonel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| Around April is when he expects to be done with the Sheriff's Department salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6841)|
| 1:54:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| The next item was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| Discussion regarding the Tazewell Pike development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| We have a bunch of people here from this area who are concerned about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| and I'd like to recognize them while they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| They've been to a lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| There's been a lot of online discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| I'd like for them to stand and just thank them for coming out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| when they didn't necessarily, you know, need or have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| They still wanted to come out and hear the discussion and hear the conversation, which I really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6886)|
| 1:54:56| I've worked extensively with Dwight VandeVate and with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6896)|
| 1:55:03| and with John King and with Mark Donaldson, an MPC, on this issue over the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6903)|
| 1:55:10| We had discussed it a little bit last week about the problem that the commission had changed somehow the zoning designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6910)|
| 1:55:20| but had not voted to update the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| So with Mark Donaldson's help, we went back to the first year that zoning was ever done in Knox County, which was 1941,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6924)|
| 1:55:34| which, ironically, is also the year my mother was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| That was the first year that there were ever zoning designations within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| At that time, apartments were permitted in both R.A. and R.B. zonings and were always permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6942)|
| 1:55:53| And there were updates made, I believe, in 1958, or maybe it was 1954,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6953)|
| 1:56:03| but apartments were permitted in both R.A. and R.B. zonings at that time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| And up until 1967, which, ironically, is the year of my birth, is when apartments have not been permitted in R.A. zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6969)|
| 1:56:20| So it was a little bit of an urban myth that we had about changing the designations but not the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| Actually, apartments were always permitted in both R.A. and R.B. zoning from 1941 to 1967, at times varying conditions attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6986)|
| 1:56:37| And I'm looking at my tutor out there to make sure he's going to wave his hand at me if I get something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| In 1988, MPC sent a recommendation to the commission to change some zoning areas on the county maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7002)|
| 1:56:48| to reflect those changes made in zoning designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| Commissioner Horner, at that meeting, made the motion to table the recommendation, and it was so voted by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7013)|
| 1:57:00| And this is why there are still so many R.B. zones mixed in with R.A. zones in these residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| and why this community is faced with this issue and this challenge today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| Now, we've done extensive research on the rules of both commission and MPC to see if there would be an ability to untable that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7031)|
| 1:57:22| after all these years, after 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| And Mary Lee would probably roll over in her grave if we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| But it turns out that MPC rules state that two members of MPC can untable a motion and then have it acted upon at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7048)|
| 1:57:40| Commission rules are silent on the issue of tabling or untabling of motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7060)|
| 1:57:47| but our rules do specify that in that case we fall back to Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| According to Robert's Rules of Order, once a motion or an item is tabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| unless it is untabled and acted upon at that meeting or the next meeting, regularly scheduled meeting of that body, it is considered dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7077)|
| 1:58:08| So there's no way to go back and revive anything from 1988 and try to address it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| So then we decided that we would try to do a resolution today on today's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7093)|
| 1:58:24| asking for a moratorium on the issuance of building permits within a certain area, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7104)|
| 1:58:34| parcels exceeding five acres within 100 feet right away of Tazewell Pike between such and such and such and such intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7114)|
| 1:58:43| We spent all weekend researching that with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| We thought we had to go there for a while and then found out today at the last minute that that wouldn't be a possibility either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| And I'm going to let Bud explain to you why we weren't able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7133)|
| 1:59:01| Generally when you end up making a resolution that in fact ends up mimicking a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7141)|
| 1:59:12| or limits development or limits land use as if it were a zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| then you have to treat it as a zoning ordinance, meaning you have to have your public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| you have to have your or generally there's generally two public hearings that occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| So because this particular issue would in fact impact land use and development as if it were in fact a zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7168)|
| 1:59:41| then we can't handle it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| You can eventually come up with a resolution to re-advise if you ask for advice from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| and have it come back as it did in 1988 and start that process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| But that's kind of what we're limited to legally at this point, unfortunately, for our visitors from Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7196)|
| 2:00:04| We do have one more remedy that we're going to try as a community later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| Also, I believe that legally once a developer has complied with all the requirements of the county in terms of planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7209)|
| 2:00:19| and approval, the county is required to issue that building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| Now, this developer has had their plans kicked back once for an insufficiency in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| They remedied that and resubmitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| Their final hurdle is the BZA hearing on Wednesday in which they're asking for a variance to reduce the number of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7232)|
| 2:00:41| So as long as that goes through, they can then be they can apply for and be issued their building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7241)|
| 2:00:51| So that is just kind of in a nutshell what this community has endured over the last couple of weeks in trying to deal with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7251)|
| 2:00:58| I have to tell you that I have never in my time on commission or before working with neighborhood groups and community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7258)|
| 2:01:06| seen a group of so many and such large homeowners associations come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7266)|
| 2:01:16| and tackle an issue like this that is so potentially volatile and frustrating in such a cooperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7276)|
| 2:01:24| and collaborative, straightforward, business-like manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| It's been impressive to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| And I'm grateful that I represent these folks because they're really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| So that is where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| That brings up the larger discussion of we still have RB zoning mixed in with RA zoning within subdivisions where it doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7303)|
| 2:01:51| and other areas where it doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| Mark Donaldson and I have spoken and come up with a couple of different ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7314)|
| 2:02:01| When I get back from the NACO legislative conference, he and I are going to sit down with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| and see what needs to be done to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| We talked last week about a strategic plan of going over the maps with a fine-tooth comb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| and I think we may have come up with a way that we can avoid that and do this in a much more clean, neat, straightforward way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7337)|
| 2:02:27| So that's what we're looking to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| This neighborhood will continue to monitor the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| We're going to be at the BZA hearing on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| And like I said, we've got one more Hail Mary that I'm going to attempt tomorrow on my own, and we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7356)|
| 2:02:44| But I just wanted to let you all know how hard they have worked for their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| and recognize just the really impressive nature of how they've come together to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7370)|
| 2:02:57| It really has been quite remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| And to also give you background on this issue and let you know, we do have an overarching issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7380)|
| 2:03:06| regardless of this development, that we need to take action on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| And I think we need to move as quickly as possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| So I look forward to bringing that forward to you at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| Does anybody have any questions after my brief history-slash-geography lesson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| Yeah, Amy, that was a very exhaustive review of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| So what's going to happen, you know, for the folks that live out there, this will be referred to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| and they're essentially the ones that are going to have to make the decision whether this goes forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| But at some point, we'll have to take an action to reconcile these zoning differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| But that really doesn't apply to, I mean, that's a general problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| It's too late for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| Definitely it's too late for this community in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| but it will prevent this from happening to other communities in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7439)|
| 2:04:06| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| The next item that's added is discussion regarding the Arena Use Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7450)|
| 2:04:17| Mr. Chairman, just very briefly, once a year we meet with the University of Tennessee Athletic Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| and they talk about Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| Since Knox County put money into the arena and as the city put in money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| they update us as to what is going on with the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| And they reported to us that they will have had over one million people go through the arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| through various and sundry events over the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| It's a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| And we asked if they could give us some type of economic impact as to the average ticket price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| or if you've got a million people and it's $30, it's $30 million, it's probably going to be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| It shows that Thompson Bowling is a regional facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| People come from all over to go to events there, everything from concerts to tractor pulls to basketball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| But I guess the other thing, too, is we talked about the amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| The university doesn't like it, but it's a 4.5 percent tax that goes to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| And the other thing they reported to us is infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| They're wanting to improve the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| They're wanting to improve dressing rooms, adjust the ramps leading up to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| The facility was built, what, in the early 80s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| And so there's a lot of need for infrastructure improvements, and they're going to be working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| And you're talking about a multimillion-dollar campaign just to improve the infrastructure in the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| Commissioner Smith, anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| I also want to update the restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| There's no hot water throughout that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| But we had a winning basketball season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| We've been up to two million by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Discussion regarding the school board retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| I just wanted to bring that up just because Mr. Hammond and Ms. Brown weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| After the retreat, Mr. Brown and I had a sunshine meeting that was surprisingly well attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7558)|
| 2:06:06| and so had some discussion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| And so that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| I just wanted to throw it back out there in case somebody else wanted to have any comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| Who set the agenda for the retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| It was a discussion that Ms. Fugate and I had together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| It was both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| Well, you know, I was a little bit under the weather that weekend, and I had a funeral and missed part of it and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7589)|
| 2:06:38| But a lot of what I saw when I was there was not stuff I didn't feel like that was beneficial for us to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7598)|
| 2:06:53| Not that Chris's work is not beneficial, but I would assume when we go for a retreat like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7613)|
| 2:07:01| that we would look more at current problems and what are some of the suggested solutions to take care of some of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7621)|
| 2:07:12| And I know that, as I started to tell Mr. Presley a while ago, we can't tell the school board how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| but working together, you know, there's a lot of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| You can't go along with blinders on and run a show without some help, particularly one with 57,000 or whatever students in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7643)|
| 2:07:37| We say it takes a village to raise a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| Well, it takes everybody in this county to be able to have some input into the education system in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7661)|
| 2:07:52| And my concern is that most folks have sat back and let things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7672)|
| 2:08:00| We're being dictated from federal right on down to take the race to the top money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| You've got to do this and do that that you don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| And, quite frankly, it's being pushed down to the point where we're dumbing down teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7689)|
| 2:08:17| The gentleman had a sign back there a while ago that said let the teachers teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| They can do it if they're given the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| I've seen it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| But when you have to spend your time teaching to a test or worrying about an evaluation coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7707)|
| 2:08:36| and the issue that was brought up with the young man that was here last month, Mark Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| I don't know if that situation has been corrected yet or is he still in limbo over his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7721)|
| 2:08:50| But to me, if a teacher has accelerated students who are averaging 98 to 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7730)|
| 2:09:01| there ain't a whole lot of room for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| They've got to be doing something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| Maybe that's the person we need to be looking toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| How do they do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| Maybe they need to be giving lessons to some of these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| These are some of the things I think we need to be talking about, you know, when we get together like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| If they don't like it, then I'm sorry, but the buck stops here with the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7759)|
| 2:09:27| We are responsible for the taxpayers in Knox County for how this money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7767)|
| 2:09:34| Now, every department is asked to turn in a budget, and every department is asked to live within that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7774)|
| 2:09:44| There are years, and this is going to be one of them coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| where that I'm sure the mayor is going to say, hey, look, you know, we heard today sales taxes are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7786)|
| 2:09:54| You're going to have to cut back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| But our departments do it year after year, but they still get the jobs done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| That's what I can't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| We pour money, pour more money, pour more money in across the street, and we're not getting the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7805)|
| 2:10:11| And that's very concerning to me, and it should be to every citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| I want the citizens of Knox County to start looking at what's going on across the street and getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7815)|
| 2:10:23| And don't come to Mike Brown or Brad Anderson and say, can't you do something about the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| You know, we approved their budget, but we can't tell them how to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| You elected those folks over there to administer a state-run education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| If you've got a problem with the way they're spending the money, then you need to be talking to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7841)|
| 2:10:47| That's the ones that are responsible for spending the money the way they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| and putting the programs in effect the way they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| So that's the type of things that I think we should be talking about when we have a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7855)|
| 2:11:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| You know, maybe we, I don't think, got the message out to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7865)|
| 2:11:12| but I know I asked during the course of the joint retreat, during my reporting of the joint committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7872)|
| 2:11:21| what items do we want to talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| I didn't get any back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| So I'll encourage people, if you have things, get them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| I know Brad sat at the chair seat and asked as well, what would you like to talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7889)|
| 2:11:36| You know, something's got to fill the vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| So there were several things that came up during our dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| and as it came up as this is a controversial item, we said, hey, let's talk about that at the joint retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| And then our chair got with the chair of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| So if there are things that need to come up, hopefully that's not our last dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| Hopefully this will this time become an annual event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| I think it was a good event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| Maybe it didn't get everything everyone would like, but I think that's what dialogues need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| It needs to be kind of continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| So hopefully we can get to some of the items that Commissioner Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| and some of the other commissioners may want to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| So as they come up, please get with the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| I don't know when my second piece is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| I don't know whether we're going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| We have our last meeting this March, the last facilitated meeting in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| I think the committee during general conversations, and you all can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Commissioner Breaux, Wright, and Hammond, I think generally like what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| and would like to continue to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| So if there's things that you want us to bring up in these joint meetings, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7966)|
| 2:12:53| We'll bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| We'll bring them up just like we got in the conversation about, I forgot the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| and I know a couple times it was over the survey way back when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| the survey that we talked about retreat before last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| I was fighting for the survey, and I had to say, hey, I wasn't in favor of it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| but I'm fighting for it because commission said we wanted these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| And that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| We will take the items that commission wants to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| and discuss them with all the enthusiasm that we can muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| But, again, you've got to give them to us, and I encourage everyone to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8004)|
| 2:13:32| Lastly, I guess I'll say that one thing that gets lost in all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| and several of us went to the state of the school's address, is we're doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8018)|
| 2:13:46| We're doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Our ACT scores aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| Put that one marker out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| But, overall, I mean, we got all As this time in value added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| which is that improvement piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| If anyone on this board should be upset, it's, you know, our achievement gaps need work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| And the superintendent and I talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| That's, you know, African-American, Hispanic, that needs work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| And we all realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| We're getting better but not quite as quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| So, you know, there are issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| There are issues that are near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| But I think, overall, when I look at it from a dollar value added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8059)|
| 2:14:26| we didn't give them much more last year, but we got some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| And I have to say, you know, at the end of the day, I'm in favor of evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| I'm just in favor of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| They can be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| They may not be the best evaluators and evaluation processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| It's never going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| Never going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| They can change this one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| People have issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Let's keep tweaking it, getting it better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| But I think teachers, principals, superintendents, everyone, commissioners need to be evaluated, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8089)|
| 2:14:58| So I guess I'll end with I think our schools are moving in a positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8098)|
| 2:15:07| Still a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| But for the bucks that we're putting in there, and we can look at the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| and you don't want to compare it to other counties, okay, it's kind of hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| But if you compare them to other counties, the bucks we're putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| the bucks those other counties are putting in, the numbers don't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| A lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| A lot of improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| A lot of morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| A lot more engagement needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| But that's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| So I guess I will say that and be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| Yeah, I just want to make a statement about where we were a few years ago to compare that to where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8141)|
| 2:15:49| And a couple of years ago, and I'm speaking a lot of this at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| because those are the things that we have the most statistics about, we were giving examinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| and we thought that 90 percent of our students were at a competency level that was sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| Well, we got an F in the evaluation by Chamber of Commerce and Businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| because those are the customers of the students that were graduating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| It's the businesses and the universities and the higher education people that have to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| We finally said that this is unacceptable, so we came up with tougher standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| And now we found out that our students, rather than 90 percent of them being competent, only 26 percent are competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8187)|
| 2:16:35| In other words, three out of four that were coming out of our school systems in Tennessee weren't ready to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| They weren't ready to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| Now, in the real world, we have nurses that can't, if we let that go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| we have nurses that can't figure out the right dosages to get patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| and we have people that can't read the manuals well enough to get jobs down at Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| So a few years ago, we changed the standards, and we thought everything was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8217)|
| 2:17:02| We were really lying to the public about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| We've changed it now to where the standards are much tougher, and we're going to continue to make them tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| Now, part of that process has involved a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| We've come up with a different curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| We've come up with different ways of testing students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| And we also felt that, or not we, but at the national level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| they felt that for us to get some of the money to try to improve things, we were going to evaluate teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| One thing that I will grant you from talking to a lot of teachers is that we may not have refined the best way to evaluate teachers the way we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8247)|
| 2:17:37| And I think when you bring in a new process, you have to continue to reevaluate that to see if it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| It does look like we've stressed teachers too much, and that's why we need to listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| We need to sit down and see how we can do it with the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| But what we cannot back off of is the fact that we're bringing on new curriculums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| The curriculums are more vigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| We've got students now that don't have to take remedial courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| either when they go to some of the colleges like South College, and there's several of those around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| and they don't have to be taking remedial courses when they're going to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| And what we need to do is to get them through these courses, get their advanced certificates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8292)|
| 2:18:19| without running up another year or two of debts, just getting them to the place they should be when they're coming out of our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| So I think we need to look at things that we aren't doing well, which may be the teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| And I think that that's being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| But let's not get away from the fact that we demanded and we asked the school system to become more rigorous, to demand more of the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8313)|
| 2:18:44| Actually, the students have responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| We've gone from 47th in the nation up to somewhere in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| I think it's in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| We're up to 31 percentile from someplace in the 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| We've jumped up into the 30s on math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| We still have a long way to go just to be average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| But we can't say, well, let's go back to where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| We can't take this, excuse the expression, the 1960s hippie approach where everyone gets a trophy, everyone gets an A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8344)|
| 2:19:15| because that just doesn't hack it when they get out there in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| They're not ready for college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| They're not ready for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| And that's what's led to the point where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| But we are making progress, but we can't retreat back to where we were a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8365)|
| 2:19:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| I'd just like to say a couple of things as regards to that, the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8376)|
| 2:19:42| And I guess, first of all, the evaluation system, it's very controversial, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8382)|
| 2:19:49| And the view of the teachers is that it's grossly unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| And I think that we, you know, you can talk about tweaking it or you can talk about how you want to adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| For those people that are in the classroom and are actually experiencing it, it's not even close, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8403)|
| 2:20:11| It's not even close to being fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| That's the danger, I think, for us as we hear about the state of the school's address or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8413)|
| 2:20:21| Those things are always laudatory and tend towards the positive, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| And there are positive things that are going on in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| Teachers are not afraid of higher standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| That's a non-issue to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| The issue is the destruction of morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| That's the issue, the lack of autonomy in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| These are issues that are destroying the classroom and destroying teachers' motivations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8447)|
| 2:20:55| You can't allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| We can't allow that to continue and not acknowledge the fact that it is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8457)|
| 2:21:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| I don't want to put Superintendent Russ on the spot, but my question is, this evaluation is a statewide evaluation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8469)|
| 2:21:20| And maybe it's just me, but I tend to look at other cities' papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| I've not heard the outcry in other communities than what I've heard in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8483)|
| 2:21:31| In fact, I talked with one of our state delegations and they actually said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| why is Knox County going so hog wild over this evaluation process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8496)|
| 2:21:51| So I guess I'll ask the superintendent, in your discussions with other superintendents, is this an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8511)|
| 2:22:02| Is this something that is as big as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| You can give a simple yes or no, and I'll repeat it back into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| I don't want to necessarily bring you up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| Is this as big an issue as other major county municipalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Yes, I'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| The reason I'm sorry to interrupt like this, but while the superintendent is coming up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8542)|
| 2:22:29| I guess that's a question that I've had all along, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8549)|
| 2:22:33| and it's really addressing Commissioner Norman's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| What are we doing here different than what's being done throughout the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| I don't want to go one way or the other with this or make it a leading question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| but just what are we doing that's different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| What could our school board do that's different than what the state guidelines are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8574)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| I think the evaluation system is in its third year across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8583)|
| 2:23:10| There are certain requirements that are statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| Every teacher has to be evaluated every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| At least 50 percent of that evaluation has to be based on student outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| and you have to use an approved model, a model that's approved by the State Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8601)|
| 2:23:29| We use the TEAM model, which is used by most school systems across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| And, you know, I think as you move through implementation of a major change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| like a new evaluation system, and you couple that with higher standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| including full implementation of common core state standards, which took effect this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| you couple that with other policy changes around tenure and collective bargaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| and other major shifts in education policy, it makes for a good bit of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8636)|
| 2:24:04| And I think that is challenging here in the Knox County schools, and I think it's challenging across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8644)|
| 2:24:12| I think what's important is that we continue to try to listen to our educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8652)|
| 2:24:19| and to make sure that we are responsive to making sure that they are supported in the great work that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8659)|
| 2:24:28| And, by the way, they're doing great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8668)|
| 2:24:31| The results that we're seeing in terms of student learning and success are remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| We, as Commissioner McKenzie said, for the first time ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| the Knox County schools scored straight A's on our state report card this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8681)|
| 2:24:47| For the first time ever, to my knowledge, we scored level five in terms of value-added growth as a district overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8687)|
| 2:24:57| and value-added five, which is the highest level that's attainable for literacy, for numeracy, and combined literacy and numeracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8697)|
| 2:25:05| We've seen consistent increases in our TCAP scores across all subject areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8705)|
| 2:25:12| So our teachers are doing a great job of educating our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| I think there's been a lot of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| There's been a lot of instructional shifts that we've asked them to make in order to get to being able to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8717)|
| 2:25:25| with these new, more rigorous standards that go further in depth, and I think that's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8725)|
| 2:25:29| And I think the work is for us to continue to make sure our teachers have the tools and resources that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| that they feel supported and are supported in the instructional work that they're doing for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| And that will allow us to make the great progress that we're making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| the strong academic progress that we're making, sustainable over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| The question that was brought I thought was appropriate and was really addressed in the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8754)|
| 2:26:02| Why Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| And so Knox County is a --it's definitely a locale where there's an extraordinary amount of resistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8764)|
| 2:26:14| and objection to the processes that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| And I thought Mr. Bigum addressed that in one respect, and that was kind of my ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8779)|
| 2:26:27| this may just be my perception, but he said that his county, this rural southeastern county in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8787)|
| 2:26:37| used basically the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| Teachers don't tend to object there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| Well, then what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| Well, it's not in ---- and this is kind of my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| It's not necessarily what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| It's how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| And I think the perception by most of our teachers, the perception is that this is definitely a punitive system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8813)|
| 2:27:06| that does not have an emphasis on bettering instruction, which I think that's what Mr. Bigum emphasized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8826)|
| 2:27:17| Our role is to take evaluation, have teachers come in, and we're going to use it to make them better teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| The perception in Knox County is that we're going to get you and we're going to decrease ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8845)|
| 2:27:34| well, we're going to manipulate your score between one and five, and that's going to affect how you are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8854)|
| 2:27:44| And it's ---- I've had this discussion with Dr. McIntyre many times about incentive pay and this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8864)|
| 2:27:54| It's maddening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| It is frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| It's fundamentally unsound and unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| And teachers have antennas a mile wide for unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8882)|
| 2:28:09| Mr. Chairman, I would ---- Commissioner Roman, I would respectfully disagree with your characterization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8889)|
| 2:28:16| We seek to make our teacher evaluation system not punitive but developmental, that we focus on reflection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8896)|
| 2:28:24| on instructional practice, and we focus on continuous improvement, doing the work that we do for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8904)|
| 2:28:30| Look, we've put in place as a state, and I think it's the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| extremely rigorous, deep academic standards for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| And if they're going to meet those standards, and by the way, they need to meet those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| If we're going to be competitive as a state, as a community, as a country, our kids need to meet those high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| And if they're going to meet those standards, we need to provide the level and depth of instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| that we're working to create and provide in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| That's what the evaluation system's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| It's not about getting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| It's not about catching people doing the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| It's about helping our instructors meet the very rigorous expectations that we've put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| And our educators are doing a great job, and we need to continue to provide them with the level of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| that they need to do that and make it a developmental system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| And by the way, we are required by the state of Tennessee to provide a differential pay plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8955)|
| 2:29:22| So we are required to provide some measure of strategic compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| And the design can differ from district to district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| But we're required by the state of Tennessee to differentiate pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8976)|
| 2:29:39| In 1963, which is 50 years ago, my sister started teaching in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8979)|
| 2:29:49| Only $300 a year was the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| I've heard enough stories over the last 50 years, and I know my sister's not going to lie to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=8994)|
| 2:30:00| And over the last five years, I've accumulated a briefcase full of stories from others whom I trust mostly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9000)|
| 2:30:08| of instance, that have happened and are still happening as far as punitive measures when they're not liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9008)|
| 2:30:22| Dr. McIntyre just said 50% of their score is the outcome judged on the outcome of their students' work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9022)|
| 2:30:34| If you've ever stood in front of a class year after year after year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9034)|
| 2:30:41| how many times did you have the same caliber of students year after year after year after year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9041)|
| 2:30:51| So if you've got a caliber of students this year that are mentally, you know, let's say in the top third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9051)|
| 2:31:00| and they show, you know, you can really lie into them, get with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9060)|
| 2:31:06| But then next year, you get a class with kids that's in the bottom third IQ-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9066)|
| 2:31:18| How are you supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| You're still teaching the same grade and the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| You cannot do both of those classes the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9085)|
| 2:31:30| You can't paint both barns with the same paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| You've got two different mules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| You're going to have to teach one how to plow one way and one how to plow the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| It just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| They have to have the latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| And they all went to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| These teachers have degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| They can read the manuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| You give them the stuff that they need to impart to the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9112)|
| 2:31:58| and I guarantee you they'll find a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| But as far as not being punished by virtue of speaking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| and why was Knox County the only one in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| I say this, we're only the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| because the teachers in Knox County are just fed up to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| and it's time that the pot boils over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| That's why that they're speaking up and have been speaking up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| and I hope they will continue to speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| because we need to impart that information to the people that are voting on school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9149)|
| 2:32:36| who are ultimately responsible for what goes on in those classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9156)|
| 2:32:44| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| You know, we hear a lot about the teachers being in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| and I can understand a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9169)|
| 2:32:50| I mean, change is really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| But, you know, there's the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| maybe things are being implied that we're worse here than somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| And what's been the rate through, not through other reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| but what's been the rate through the teacher evaluations that people have lost their job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| In other words, if your denominator is the number of students in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9189)|
| 2:33:15| what's been the numerator for the number that had been dismissed over teaching evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| not over something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| I believe the number last year was just over a dozen out of about 4,000 teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| that we moved for revocation of tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| I don't have time to do the math here real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| but how does that compare to the rest of the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| I didn't know if we had any idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9223)|
| 2:33:44| But, again, our emphasis is on providing our teachers with the support that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9224)|
| 2:33:51| to continue to get better at their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| That's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| It's about what happens is you have someone come into your classroom and observe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9233)|
| 2:34:00| and they script the class, really take notes on what the teacher is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| what the students are saying, what activities are happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| and then they go through and look at the instructional instrument that we use for evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| and they provide evidence of how our teachers are doing against those research-based practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9255)|
| 2:34:22| which are known to help students to learn effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9262)|
| 2:34:27| And then at the end of that, there's a conversation that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| There's a post-conference where the observer and the teacher sit down together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9271)|
| 2:34:37| and talk through what they saw, what evidence they saw of effective instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9277)|
| 2:34:42| and an area for reinforcement, so where are you doing really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9282)|
| 2:34:46| and something we saw that was great, and an area for refinement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| a place where you can continue to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| I have to say, I think those 10,000-some-odd conversations that we had last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9292)|
| 2:34:59| about great instruction and what we've seen in our classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| it's a big part of some of the improvement that we've seen in student learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| that we're seeing both here in the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| and then also across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| So I really feel like that reflection upon practice is an important part of the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9312)|
| 2:35:19| It's an important part of continuous improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| and it's an important part of how we make sure our kids meet these really rigorous standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| that we put in place so they can be successful for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| Just by the way, that's 0.03% would be Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9329)|
| 2:35:38| He's a scientist, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| Even if he can't referee right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| I have a calculator on my phone, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9345)|
| 2:35:49| I just want to say, in relation to all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| there's not a teacher I've talked to who is afraid of higher standards for children or for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| There's not a teacher I've talked to who opposes evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| I think there are kinks in our evaluation system that definitely need to be addressed, and quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9363)|
| 2:36:12| I think some of them maybe we can address here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| Some of them are going to have to go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| And my own feeling about how this instrument is being used is to say that it's being used to support teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9379)|
| 2:36:28| and to help them grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| I see that side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| I truly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| But when whether or not your strategic payment is based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9392)|
| 2:36:39| then, in fact, there is a side of it that is either punitive or rewarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9399)|
| 2:36:45| So I see it in both ways, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| It's not just a way to make teachers better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| It's also a way to either reward them or not reward them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| And I've told you this flat out before, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| You've heard this out of my mouth before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| I think strategic compensation sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| And if the state requires it, the state requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| But that's why I would like to see different people in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| and the legislature than those we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| So I think one of the biggest issues is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9435)|
| 2:37:22| and this is what I thought about when that wonderful man from the little county came and talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9442)|
| 2:37:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| That's a tiny little county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| He can be in every state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| As a superintendent, he could be in every school every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| We are so much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| And he has time to develop a professional or personal relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| with probably just about every teacher in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| We are so much bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9471)|
| 2:37:54| That's just not possible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| So I think that a lot of the unrest is due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9476)|
| 2:38:04| and agitation is due to just simply the size of the structure of what we're working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9484)|
| 2:38:10| than what we see in the smaller counties across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| So that's my own perspective on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| But I don't know any teacher who is afraid of higher standards for their students or themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9497)|
| 2:38:28| or who are concerned about evaluations except for areas where they definitely, I think we all agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9508)|
| 2:38:38| need to be tweaked in terms of if a teacher is getting evaluated on the performance of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9518)|
| 2:38:43| that they have never taught, that's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| especially when that teacher's compensation is tied to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| I see that as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| So those are the specifics that I think we need to focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| and I think we do need to focus on those specific issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| rather than just encouraging agitation and encouraging the pot to boil over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9541)|
| 2:39:09| We need to be working cooperatively and collaboratively towards solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9549)|
| 2:39:14| that benefit our students and our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| And you're about to giggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9558)|
| 2:39:19| I can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| Say something funny, Vic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| I would say, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| I think that's an important point in terms of working collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| And I think this has been a healthy and productive conversation that we're having in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| about the support for our teachers in doing the great work they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9578)|
| 2:39:39| We've put in place a teacher work group around professional support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| It's now transitioned into a teacher advisory committee for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| the structure that I'm going to keep in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| The recommendations that they made I took in whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| and put together an 11-point action plan that I presented to the Board of Education last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9592)|
| 2:40:02| That has been very well received by our teachers in terms of some of the specific things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| that they asked for around evaluation and around assessment we're now doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9607)|
| 2:40:12| And I think continuing that conversation will be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| I would also say to others who have some broader questions about what we've been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9616)|
| 2:40:22| some of the specifics of the outcomes that we're seeing in our future direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| we did have this State of the Schools event, and it included an address by me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| but it was a broader event that included students' presentations and student performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9630)|
| 2:40:37| And Jamie Woodson from Tennessee SCORE came and spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| I'd encourage you, I know a couple of you are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| but I would encourage those of you who weren't there to take a look at that online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| It's on our website at knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| You can watch the video or read the text of the remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| I think that we worked very hard to give a great summary of where we have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9653)|
| 2:40:58| what kind of outcomes we're seeing, what are some of the challenges that we face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| and how do we work through those and what's our strategic direction for the future of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| So I would really encourage you to take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| because I think it will give you a great insight into the direction that we're moving in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| and how we continue to sustain the great academic progress that we're seeing in the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| All right. There's no more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| And we had a discussion about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| Nobody said rubric. That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| Numeracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| If there's no other items, come before Dr. Rott or Attorney Rott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9691)|
| 2:41:37| Assistant Deputy Law Director, we have some things on our calendar upcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9697)|
| 2:41:45| The Rules Committee is meeting before the next work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| The Joint Education Committee is meeting the 6th at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9711)|
| 2:41:59| I'm just sending an e-mail to ask for that date to be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| I know there's a couple of folks, including myself, that can't make that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9724)|
| 2:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| But we will be having a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9729)|
| 2:42:10| And whatever the date is going to be, to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9730)|
| 2:42:13| And then Commissioner Schaust and Commissioner Broyles and I have been involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140224?start=9733)|
