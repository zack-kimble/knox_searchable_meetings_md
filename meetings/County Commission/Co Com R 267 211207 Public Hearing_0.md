| 0:01:08| Today's public hearing is concerning the appointment of a General Sessions judge to fill the seat held by the Honorable Judge Jeffrey P. Emory, who is retiring at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=68)|
| 0:01:20| We have four applicants who have expressed interest in this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| They are Judson Kyle Davis, Sarah Winningham Keith, Rockford D. King, and Carrie S. O'Rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=86)|
| 0:01:36| We will begin today's public hearing with candidate interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| Each candidate will be given up to five minutes to address commission, and commissioners will have the opportunity to ask questions during each interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=101)|
| 0:01:50| We will then move the public hearing into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| If anyone from the public wishes to address the commission concerning this appointment, then the floor will, of course, be open for commissioners to discuss or ask further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=114)|
| 0:02:04| At the conclusion of this public hearing, we will move into special session to select the appointee to fill this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:14| I do want to recognize the Honorable Judge Tony Stansbury, who is here today to make himself available for the commissioners in case they have any questions concerning the nature of the position itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=134)|
| 0:02:27| Your Honor, thank you for making yourself available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Thank you for having me. I don't really have any prepared remarks. I didn't want to make myself available in case anybody had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| I can give you some stats from 2019, including 2019-2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| We had 104,000 cases filed. We disposed of 98,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| Revenue generated between all five sessions judges, and part of that fiscal year for civil side is $7.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=169)|
| 0:03:01| There's a question about, do we have a need for a colleague to be appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| The answer is yes, I would think. We do need the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| I can't give you an accurate figure on how backed up we are, but we are backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| I heard one of the criminal court judges the other day say that they were on track, despite COVID, to do 100 jury trials this year, which is remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=196)|
| 0:03:27| But we're going to have to do the same to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Mr. Jett, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge, for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| As we begin to hear from candidates and consider appointing a colleague, could you help us better understand what characteristics that you feel are most important to serve in this role as one of your colleagues and someone to fill Judge Emery's seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=220)|
| 0:04:03| Temperament, character, integrity, honesty, I think those are all very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| Knowledge of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| You can have some civil experience and some criminal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| They're all civil or all criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Four of the five current sessions judges are former assistant DAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| Judge Emery came out of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| I've been asked on the campaign trail why we don't have a designated civil specialist, a civil trial specialist, just to hear civil cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=270)|
| 0:04:39| And that was my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| I said four out of five of us are criminal, have criminal prosecution background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| And Jeff, we all just decided when I came on board so many years ago that we would rotate through the different courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| So all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| Any further questions for Judge Stansbury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you very much, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| We will move now to candidate interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| And I will do these in the order that they were given to us by the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| And we'll begin with Judge Kyle Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Sir, if you will state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| And you have up to five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| And commissioners may have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| My name is Judson Kyle Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| Street address is 602 South Carter School Road, Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| Commissioners, the people of Knox County deserve to have the most qualified professionals serving them in every area of government, including our justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=340)|
| 0:05:51| That's why I'm campaigning for this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| And that's the reason I'm standing before you today asking for you to appoint me to serve our community as General Sessions' judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| I have the depth and breadth of experience required to manage and adjudicate Sessions' cases immediately upon appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=359)|
| 0:06:07| I have served Knox County as an assistant district attorney for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| Before that, I worked in private practice for several years representing Knox County in both criminal and civil matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| As you're aware, our General Sessions' courts handle criminal and civil cases, with the judges hearing all types of cases from felony, misdemeanor, DUI, housing issues, contract cases, and traffic matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=378)|
| 0:06:34| As an attorney, I have experience in all of these areas, and that experience, along with my work ethic, my respectful demeanor to all who come before the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| combine to offer Knox County as the most qualified person for General Sessions' judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Because of my experience in all aspects of General Sessions' cases, I'll be able to effectively and efficiently serve the people of Knox County as General Sessions' judge from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=407)|
| 0:06:59| So, I'd like to thank all of you for the time you've invested in this process to ensure that our court system continues to function in an efficient and professional manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| and I humbly ask for your vote to appoint me as General Sessions' judge to allow me to continue to serve this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=427)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Are there any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| I was going to ask some questions, but our Honorable Judge that got up there was asked the questions what he thought a judge should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| So, that took up most of my answers that I would be asking you, that you could piggyback on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| So, I'm going to ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| This has to do with public, and I'm just going to ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Since it is a public judgeship and you're dealing with the public, do you participate in voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| You vote in all elections as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| Every election since I've been able to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| I was registered and participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| As you heard from the judge, I knew how many cases it normally comes between that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| Do you have a plan so far how you're going to litigate that many cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Well, Commissioner, it's not just the volume of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| In Sessions' court, it's the pace at which these cases come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| It's just . . . it's so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| It's so quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Everybody's talking to everybody, and I feel like what Judge Stansberry said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| your demeanor, your calm demeanor, your patience with people, that's going to be very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| And having been in that courtroom, dealing with it at that pace, I believe my experience is going to be suited to fill this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=513)|
| 0:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Any other questions, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Mr. Davis, you've worked with Judge Emery, obviously in a different role for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| What are some things that you have seen Judge Emery, how he's run his court, that you feel like you could build upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=540)|
| 0:09:09| and how would you approach this position in a different manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| Well, I think he embodies all the personal qualities that were put before us by Judge Stansberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| Probably every single one of them, I think he fits the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| But I think, you know, seeing the way he treats people, no matter what they're facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| I think is something that I would inspire to build upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| And I think that's important because, you know, in the criminal courts, you get the victims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| you get the witnesses, and you get the defendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| And they're all there for a reason, and they all . . . usually it's somebody else's fault, it's the defendant's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=589)|
| 0:09:59| So those people are not there at . . . they don't want to be there, the victims and the witnesses generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| And so I think treating them fairly is, you know, hearing out everything they have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| is something that's very important to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| But also, giving these defendants their day in court is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| And the same thing goes for the civil side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| I think that's important because we have to carry forward this idea of justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| And in order for it to work properly, those defendants also have to be given, you know, their due in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| And so I think that's important, and that's where I will strive to build on what he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:47| Any further questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=647)|

| 0:11:12| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner, and the rest of the members of the commission for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=672)|

| 0:11:38| I believe that I am running for the position not because of being a Democrat or being a Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| because our courts handle cases for everyone, every race, gender, socioeconomic background, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| I have worked for Democrats, I've worked for Republicans, and my day-to-day business hasn't been affected by that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| because my charge, regardless of who has been my supervisor or boss, has been go forth and do justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| And that is my creed and my motto and what I intend to take to the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| We don't look when we're taking these cases at whether this bill was signed by Phil Bredesen or Bill Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| We have to look at what the circumstances of the case are, what are the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| and how does the law apply to these facts and circumstances, and what does justice demand on each individual case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| I grew up in Scott County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| I went to Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville for undergrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| Upon completion of my undergraduate degree, I came to Knoxville to attend the University of Tennessee College of Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| Subsequent to my graduation, I went to the 10th District, which is down in southeast Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| I didn't know anybody there, had no family connections there, but wanted to find a job and go out on my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| and be in a situation where it was a bit uncomfortable and I didn't know people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| And it was a great experience to do that for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| I handled multiple counties in that prosecution, and we had a morning docket, an afternoon docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| Sometimes we broke for dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I'm used to working long hours and intend to continue that as my role as the general sessions judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| When I came to Knox County after one year of working down in Cleveland, I came back and started working in the DUI sessions unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| I've also worked grand jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| I've worked in general felony sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| I headed up the Vehicular Fatality Investigation Review Board, where we reviewed every vehicular fatality in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| a multi-agency review to determine whether they were appropriate for prosecution or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| In addition to that, I've served on a number of multi-agency committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| including the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and the CIPIT team, which is the Child Protective Investigative Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| In those roles, I have had divergent roles with the people on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| It's sometimes with DCS. It's sometimes with medical staff. It's sometimes law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| And we have all these collateral things that can be included with the decisions that we make on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| that will affect family court, juvenile court, civil court, sessions court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| So I had the experience to see how decisions for prosecution or not for prosecution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| or for decisions in sessions court, how they will affect, a ripple effect on these people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| After concluding serving in DUI sessions, I went to the Career Gain Unit and did that caseload for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=878)|
| 0:14:46| That included cases from thefts and property crimes all the way up to murders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| Subsequent to that, I spent three years in the Child Abuse Unit, including being the team leader for a period of time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| Those cases are difficult. It involves making very hard decisions about whether to prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| I've been in the trenches of making hard decisions where we have situations where I believe a person is guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| but I understand that the law in this situation demands that we cannot ethically go forward with a prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| I've had cases where I have seen someone that I was very sympathetic for them as a defendant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| but believe they had done someone wrong and the law demanded that we pursue prosecution on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| Sometimes people have been very angry with the decisions that we've made on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| These have been Class A felonies or situations where someone had a family member who was dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| I've had to look them in the eye and make the decision of whether to prosecute or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| So I've been in the trenches to make decisions where it mattered and when it was tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| In addition to that, I've worked with law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| I've been the on-call attorney for special units, which pretty much put me on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for questions they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| That was snap decisions on whether they had probable cause to arrest, whether they had probable cause for search warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| I have reviewed hundreds, possibly up to 1,000 search warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| That is something that would be done as a general sessions judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| There are after-hour things that judges do in addition to handling a docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| They also have those things where they have to determine whether this particular document protects the citizens' Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:41| And also looking at this and saying, yes, that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| This needs to be executed in order to protect the community from someone who's committed a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| I apologize, we don't have a timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| If you could take about 30 or 40 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| I'll probably done hundreds and possibly thousands of preliminary hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| I'm ready to go into sessions and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| which means I'm managing dockets in sessions and criminal court simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| I'm here running, applying for this position and plan to campaign for the position because I believe that every case matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1030)|
| 0:17:20| Every person who comes into the courtroom, it doesn't matter how monolithic we look at statistics, the case that matters the most to them is their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1040)|
| 0:17:30| And we have to look at each of them individually and respect their time and handle the docket efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| We need to respect the facts of the case and the circumstances where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| So we handle the cases accurately and we need to look at the law and how it applies to these facts and these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| So we handle the cases justly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| And that is what I will strive and maintain to do each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I'm ready to go to work and continue working hard for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you, Ms. Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Commissioners, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Again, it's public office. Have you been voting and have you voted in your elections like you should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Let me get on the microphone. Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I think that our democracy is too important to not vote in races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| I vote in each election that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| I registered to vote as soon as I could after I turned 18 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| I think local politics, they say it's true, all politics are local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| And I think that getting involved, especially on the local level, it affects people day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| People just pay attention to the big national races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| But what happens in here affects more people and the citizens on their day to day lives than what happens in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| at the White House or the halls of Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Something you said kind of troubled me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| You said, did you know what justice is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| How do you know what justice is if you haven't heard any of the evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| What I mean is we have to see what justice is under the circumstances of each case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| And I hope I maintain that when I say each case is individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| We can't look at them monolithically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| We have to look at what the facts are and apply the law to those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| I am never making a decision on an investigation file that I've reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| I would never make a decision on a case that comes in front of me in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| without hearing from the litigants and reviewing what evidence is in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| What justice is, is applying the law to the facts as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| I just misunderstood you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1184)|

| 0:19:53| What separates you from the other three candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| What a lucky problem to have when we have outstanding applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| and I think that's a testament to the bar that we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| I'm not running against individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I'm running for an office because I believe that I would be good at this particular position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| Again, I've had the experience to have to review investigative files on very troubling situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| vehicular fatalities, child rapes, murder, child exploitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| and there are cases that I've determined are appropriate for prosecution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| and cases I've determined are not appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| and I've had to make those hard decisions and tell law enforcement when they disagreed with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| tell victims when they disagreed with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| go to defense attorneys and tell them that they can't have what they've asked for and what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| I've had to be in the trenches and make those hard decisions where the stakes were incredibly high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| Again, I've been on call and taken calls at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| I've taken calls at 3 a.m. and tried to answer questions to the best of my ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| with the facts that were coming into me on what is the appropriate next step of action to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| Again, I have worked with a number of multidisciplinary agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| I have some exposure with civil law, with HMVO process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| I handled all of those for a period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| which is a civil procedure that was designating individuals as habitual motor vehicle offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| So it went through the entire civil law process of summons and hearings or summary judgments and orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| and additionally working when I was doing crash reconstruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| with a number of civil law firms in their crash lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| Additionally, I have had experience working in criminal prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| There are cases which can become either civil contract disputes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| or something like a commercial or construction fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| and there are very specific statutes which determine whether it's a civil or a criminal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| So I've worked with civil attorneys and worked with victims to determine whether that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| which path is the most appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| I think the fact that I've worked in such a diverse type of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| I've never just been general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| I've never just been specialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I've been a continuous student of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| particularly when we look at things like child abuse or DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| There's a tremendous amount of litigation that is involved in those types of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| and so in addition to statutory changes that occur very regularly, pretty much every legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| you also have a huge volume of case law that comes through where the courts are interpreting those statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| So I've constantly had to stay abreast of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Statute of limitations for different events could be different based on the month that it occurred in a particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| So the fact that I've had to stay abreast of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and consistently study the law to make sure that we are making the proper decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| on each and every one of those very nuanced situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| and switch gears from doing this type of law to that type of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| means it is something where I am very adept and nimble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| in taking new facts in and being able to work and process through that information appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you, Commissioner Jaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Seeing none, thank you, Ms. Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And I just want to say to all the applicants, I do apologize that we don't have a timer in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| Commissioners, just because of the importance of the position we're appointing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| I am letting the time run all the way out, the five minutes all the way out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| and then letting the candidate know that they have about another minute to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Our next applicant is Rockford D. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| Mr. King, if you will set your name and address, you have up to five minutes to address the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and then commissioners may have questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you, sir. Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| My name is Rockford King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Most everyone that knows me refers to me as Rocky, Rocky King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| I live in the Bluegrass area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| It's at 9137 Hells Abbey Lane off of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| I'm an attorney at Edgerton McAfee Law Firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| Been there for about 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Prior to that, worked with a couple firms out of law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Back in the days when we had Valley Bank and Park Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| some of those things that don't exist any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| I've been in civil law 99.9% of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| Some years ago when some of the criminal matters got backed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| and there was a request for attorneys in Knoxville to step forward and help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| I was one of the folks that did my best in that arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| But in all honesty, I've been in civil court my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| I've probably been in every county in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| I've practiced in all federal courts in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I've practiced before the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| But, you know, some of the things that's always been so important to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| when I first started, when I was at Valley Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| I started off doing what was referred to then, for lack of a better way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| collection work, which meant I was in every general sessions court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| from Nashville to Mountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Got to meet every judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| And back in those days, not everyone had to be a lawyer to be a sessions judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| And of course, I met many attorneys throughout the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| many of which are friends, some of which are in this room today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| And one of the things that was most important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| as I was learning my craft was understanding the importance that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| for the most part, there's three things in that courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| There's the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Then there's the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| And then, of course, you've got this thing called the law, the justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| That's the stuff that we go to school and we go through the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| And we are tested, and then we're sent out in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| And then it's through practice, watching others, learning the craft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| developing one's own style that you allow yourself to progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| and you determine how you can best serve those three entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| There's always, if you go to trial, there is a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| And for the most part, there is a loser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| And you have to be able to handle that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| You will have attorneys who can be cordial or non-cordial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| You have to learn how to deal with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| And then, obviously, you have to learn what is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| we've talked about demeanor and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Well, the demeanor of the judge plays a huge role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| I remember many times seeing judges treat attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| in a way that I would not have wanted to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| I've seen judges who have treated plaintiffs and defendants and witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| in ways that I would not want to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| But after 30-some years of practicing, I've been, I teach other lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| I do a lot of continuing legal education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| For years, because I come out of the Johnny Majors era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| I did some work with the Major League Baseball Players Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| the NFL Players Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Some of those things worked with a lot of really interesting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Through my practice, which has been primarily defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| for about 25 years, the last 10 years have been much different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| but have been president of a lot of national organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| the Tennessee Defense Lawyers Association, and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| But, you know, in the last 5-10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| friends at the Knoxville Bar Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Marsha Watson, our executive director, who I can't say enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| she's a wonderful person and a gifted leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| But they have a program where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| and it's not necessarily indigent people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| but it's people that have claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| They've got a problem, and for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| they can't find a law firm or a lawyer to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| And I have gotten involved in those matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Had a trial scheduled in Judge Stansberry's office two days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| but we got it worked out that morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| and have gotten very active again in our General Sessions Courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| not only in Knox County, but the surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| working with people who, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| this is their one and only experience with the judicial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| So many people, you know, are in the General Sessions Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| but for whatever reason, they're not in our circuit courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| or chancery courts or juvenile courts or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| So, I've had a wonderful experience in the practice of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| I would like to have the opportunity to continue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| for the first time in a judicial position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| It's one where my respect, not only for the lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| but all participants who come in that courtroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| will be given, I do believe that I possess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| at least an average knowledge of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| I continue all of my continuing legal education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| and I continue to help other lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| with their continuing legal education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Mr. King, about 30 or 40 more seconds. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| And I'd just like to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I have voted for my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| One of the things, you know, growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| I'm a coal miner's son from West Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Dad was in the Second War, and Mom and Dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| made a strong impression upon the importance of voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| something that I've done my best to pass on to my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| And I think that I appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| I don't thank it. I do appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Are there any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Mr. King, given, you mentioned several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| and clearly by the documentation you presented us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| your background has been mostly on the civil side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| How do you believe that your experience there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| will translate, given the large caseload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| of the criminal side necessary for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| My brother was a prosecuting attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| for over 25 years before he went on the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| in the criminal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| And I've been around the system a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| although I have not, as I openly admit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I have not stepped foot in a Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| criminal courtroom in over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| And, you know, it goes back to some of the basic education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| When I was in law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| and when Judge Stansbury and I were in law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| we had criminal law, crim pro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| we had Professor Gobert and Professor Cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| and it was the stuff that sticks with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| There are certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| I'm not necessarily equating it to riding a bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| because as some of the other applicants have mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| the law is always changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| thanks to our folks in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| sometimes for the better, sometimes not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| but it is changing and evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| And it requires, one, to do some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| And that's the type of work I'm willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| And it's the type of work I'd never been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| in the NFL Players Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| That required work on my part to learn how to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| with any of the associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| You just have to kind of get down and dirty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and you've got to decide if you're willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| And if I wasn't, I would not be standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| But that is a very good fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| I'll be the first to admit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| I have not practiced in criminal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| that much in my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I'm glad you answered my question first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| which I normally ask there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| You were saying that you've been a lawyer in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| Now you're going to be on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| You're going to be on the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| And you've got to hear both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| and stuff like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| But you said you practice it as a craft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| to learn your craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| And I think a judgeship, or a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| or something like that, is more than just a craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| It's got to be something more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| But you mentioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| as your lawyer, part of it is a craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| So, but the judge cannot be a crafty type job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| and it must be something that's very malleable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| for the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I wondered why you used the term craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Because that's what I've been doing professionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| for over 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| It's been that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| and it's been that professional experience that I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| And I've never been in the official judgeship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| You know, we've had mock trial things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| and we have different educational things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| that we have had in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| This will be our fifth year this coming January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| where we have two day trials for attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| who've been practicing 10 years or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And I'm a judge in those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| And that's where you leave the craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| The craft being the knowledge you develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| the experience, knowing what the rules of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| and law and civil procedure are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| And then you have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Mr. King, the two previous candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| said that they're seeking the election of this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Are you also seeking the election of this office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| They're wanting to be elected to this seat in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Are you also seeking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I honestly have not made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I haven't gotten to that point yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| But it is something I'm considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| But I honestly don't have a yes or no answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| From the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Our next applicant is Carrie S. O'Rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Welcome, Ms. O'Rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| If you'll state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| You have up to five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| And the commissioners may have questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| And thanks to all of you all for giving me the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| to speak with you. I'm honored to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| And a little bit intimidated by my predecessors, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| It's Carrie O'Rear, 3555 Colchester Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| It's Knoxville 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| I'm a South Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| And have been almost continuously since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| Grew up out in West Knoxville and Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| before it was the Farragut that we see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Which is beautiful, but very different than it was in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| My reasons are a little bit different than everyone else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| I was trying to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I found out that there was this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| and tried to look and see who might be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| that wasn't running to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| that there was an opportunity for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| to have that resource available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| if they decided that they wanted to pick someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| who hadn't made the determination to actually seek election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| At this point, that's not something that I'm ready to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| I've been involved distantly in civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| and criminal sessions that were together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| I've seen that pace and busyness, and I loved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| It was something I did early in my practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| when I worked for Legal Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| I worked on a domestic violence docket every Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| that was in Sessions Court in the circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| And civil and criminal cases were heard together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| on those matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| So I did have the opportunity to work hand in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| with the prosecutors, the public defenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| private attorneys, and the judges on those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| I didn't represent my clients who were the victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| in the criminal part necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| but I collaborated and helped advocate for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| make sure that they were protected in their civil rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| I've spent time in the civil sessions court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| more distantly, but the other concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| that I had about that court was knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| that with COVID and all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| with COVID and all of the delays that we've all experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| in having access to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| that it was important for the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| and for this community to have someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| who was willing to step into the role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| if there wasn't another candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| And I frankly couldn't find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| I didn't even know who the other candidates were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| until after the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| I didn't see any scuttlebutt about that in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| I'm not necessarily very connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| in the political community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| And I frankly wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| that this was something that this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| was protected from, was an unwanted absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| in that very important role of managing these dockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| that are already struggling with some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| that we've had of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| As far as my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| it's also very heavily civil, not criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| I'm intrigued by criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| I have criminal law friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| I love to hear about legal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| that they encounter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| but I haven't had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| to serve in that role in that type of a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| I do think just hearing from our two prosecutors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| that are here today that it's obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| that Knox County has some very strong players| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| in that part of our bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| just like most of Knoxville's bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| And I think one of the nice things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| and hope that one of the nice things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| for our sessions judges in that capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| is that they're able to rely on the strength of that bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| to help facilitate what would be a struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| at the beginning to get up and running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| with the way that court functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| having never participated in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| I don't have any doubt that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Mark Stevens, who was our public defender for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| I saw how he operated his office and his people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| how Blount County does it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| and it's astounding what our public resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| are able to accomplish with the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| that's available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| So I would rely heavily on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| in trying to transition into an area of practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| that I don't have my own personal experience with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I do have a lot of experience in civil practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| in most matters that are heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| not only in circuit court but also in sessions court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| landlord-tenant issues on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| consumer protection on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| personal injury, property damage, contract disputes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| all of those things on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| from the plaintiff and the defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| which I really think is what my strength is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| is that I actually do feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I have the ability to be a neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| which is what our judges are supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| I don't know any of the other three applicants personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| I'm sure they would do an amazing job at that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| but I know that recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| I've gone through mediation training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| and that was the other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| that sort of prompted my interest in taking this chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| and making this opportunity a possibility for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| is that I really gravitate toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| trying to help people find a safe place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| to get to the end of their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| And I think that's a really important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| of what we're trying to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| is that we're trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| that there is a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Mediation is unique in that you don't cast judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| but as a judge, you do have the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| particularly in sessions court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| to help folks who wouldn't otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| have the resources and tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| to get to the end of their process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| whether it's as a victim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| as a civil litigant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| and even as a defendant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| who doesn't have enough experience as a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| and enough familiarity with our bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| having been a part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| for too many years to admit publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| You know, those are tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| that I think I bring to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| that are more intangible than tangible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| as far as something that you can put on a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| So again, I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| I hope that I am considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| and that I at least am close to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| in the same boat as these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| who have already spoken to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| but appreciate your time here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Thank you, Ms. O'Rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Do you vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| I do vote, and I actually had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| of knowing that question was coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| so I've got an extra answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I vote. I have voted since I was a kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| 18, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| but I've also helped other people sign up to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| regardless of what their political affiliation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| or mine is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I think it's important to get out the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| that maybe didn't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| that was something that could be important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Would you run for the office if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| You know, I've thought a lot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| The gentleman that I work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| was very supportive of me taking this chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| and I talked to him about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| that it would be my thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| that if I was lucky enough to be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| that I would want to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| to come back if he would have me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| He said he would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| but he encouraged me to keep an open mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| and I think that the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| that I would consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| would be that if the feedback I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| from the local bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| and from the people who were in my courtroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| supported that I was someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| who they would appreciate having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| continue to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| that would be something I would get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| some feedback and response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| before I would make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| but if I felt like my presence there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| was going to be a benefit to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I would ultimately consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| But I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| It's not something, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| that I've planned on or even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| you know, thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| other than if it were at the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| or thought of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you, Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Ms. O'Rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| you had several years of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| working with Legal Aid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| which represents those who either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| aren't able to or in other circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| need representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Is there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| What of your experience there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| would help you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| have better judgment as a judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| What experience can you draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| that would put you on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| of the bench?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| It's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| It actually is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| the most important thing for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| and it set my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| I guess my mentality about things early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| because having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| every Thursday experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| and the support that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| not necessarily voluntarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| some of whom were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Actually, all of whom were income eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| but they also were all facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| life-essential issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| It was housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| You know, people who are being evicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| from public housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| if they lose that housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| they don't have anywhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| So knowing the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| I guess having had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| to have that very short window of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| for these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| it can be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Anybody that's in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| can be having a life-changing experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| It may be fleeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| It may be life-changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| And I think having that experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| really early and really green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I just, like Mr. King talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| I didn't know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| as Keith talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| I didn't know a soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| They threw me in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| but having that experience with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| as a new attorney trying to help people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| who otherwise wouldn't have an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| really instilled in me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| an appreciation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| what an impact a judge can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| for not only the litigants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| the people who are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| and the victims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| and the defendants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| but also young lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| and our next batch of judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| and our next batch of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| who may be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| the next batch of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| who may not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| So it really helped me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| kind of keep an eye on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| the diversity of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| that we have in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| and not all of us are lucky enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| be able to make it day to day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| and everything that happens there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| has the possibility of having an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| that can be monumental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| and I think I'd be very aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| I just had a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| I'm looking through your resume beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| and the last two jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| have you been litigating in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Well, my cases are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| 75% litigation-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| but with COVID, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| I haven't, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| I mean, I haven't been in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| the way that I was prior to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| When was the last time you practiced in court then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| I went to court in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I mean, I was here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| to drop off paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| If you mean actually like before a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| and advocating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| Probably two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| in Sessions Court in another county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| and I have a hearing scheduled next week, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Were you active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| I'm just reading through the resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| the portions down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| have that you were litigating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| and in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| I don't see any parts that were in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| That's what kind of led me to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| And I, my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| the clarification there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| is kind of hard to capture in words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| The firm that I worked for before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| my current firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| was a healthcare liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| my part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| work there was healthcare liability-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| so all of those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| essentially were litigation-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| because they all arose from lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| for professional liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| And your role was to argue them in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| And what I do in addition to the litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| is I actually am more involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| in working with our clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| to help avoid litigation if possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| and that's where I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I kind of gravitate toward trying to resolve things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| and trying to help people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| avoid the process if they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| but I'm there to advocate for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| if they have to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| So a lot of my clients do end up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| I have pending lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| if this appointment doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| but a lot of what I do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| is really focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| a little bit of counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| in advance of making a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| about whether litigation is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| And I believe everybody's stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| what do you think your percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| is civil to criminal that you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Mine's like Mr. King's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Mostly civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| As far as actually litigating in criminal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| I don't directly represent clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| in criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| I have had companion cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| that have a criminal component to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| that I have to be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| and participate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| but I haven't litigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| on behalf of a criminal defendant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Understood. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Any other questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you very much, Ms. O'Rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I appreciate everyone's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| and good luck with your decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Is there a clarifying question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| for Judge Sandsbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| if I could ask him, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Certainly, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Your Honor, could I please ask you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Commissioner Ward has a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| In your experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| what percentage of the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| on an average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| between all the Sessions Court judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| are you guys seeing civil cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| versus criminal cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| or is it 80% civil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| And people that come into contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| with the court system overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| 80% of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| that come into contact with any court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| will be in civil or criminal sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Understood. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I appreciate your clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I had one more. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| No, you're fine. Go ahead, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Ms. Keith, if you're available, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| I think I heard from all the other candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| but I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| if you had experience in civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| I heard a lot of criminal stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| but have you had experience in civil court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| My civil experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| is significantly more limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| than my criminal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| I have done some LLC paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| for a family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I've additionally done, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| some quasi-civil things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| HMVO petitions when I was handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| the entire docket of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| as a family law prosecutor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| That was the adjudication of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| determining that they were habitual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| motor vehicle offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| and that was an entirely civil process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| that we did through the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| and through criminal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| but as a civil process through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211207-public-hearing?start=3038)|
