| 0:08:21| And it's because of the rhetoric rhetoric we've heard about the COVID-19 vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| I understand that the COVID-19 vaccine is a political issue, but it did not stay contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| to the COVID-19 vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| That spread throughout the community and now we've eroded the trust between our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| our parents, and our medical professionals, our doctors and our nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| And so now kids aren't getting their basic immunizations because of politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| And I know nobody on this commission wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| And so with what you're considering this evening, a resolution that has no practical value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=539)|
| 0:09:08| a resolution that will not do anything except make a political statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| I would encourage you to just discard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| It is practically worthless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| It is politically poisonous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| And quite frankly, it could kill kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| I am a U.S. Army veteran that deployed to Afghanistan three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| And I can tell you that I was mandated to get way more vaccines than I even knew existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| I don't know if you've been vaccinated for smallpox lately, but that's not a walk in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| I'm pretty sure most of you have not been vaccinated for anthrax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| But that's a five jab, very painful experience that I had to go through and was mandated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| because it prevented a catastrophe for our troops when they got abroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| So let's, in this rhetoric, let's put the future in perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| and figure out where we want to go and stop playing politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Having said that, I'd also like to just point out what happened in Flint, Michigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=620)|
| 0:10:29| with their water system was not a product of inadequate supplies or bad resources or bad infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=629)|
| 0:10:38| That was a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Let's take a look at Flint, Michigan and realize we don't want Halls and Powell to become that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=641)|
| 0:10:50| Flint happened because people moved too politically fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Halls and Powell could degrade quickly because this commission doesn't move with enough speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| So please address that issue before it becomes a real world problem. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=660)|

| 0:12:50| This is around $221,000 of new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=770)|

| 0:13:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Just for the record, it may be $221,000 for new roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| but these roads are built by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| All infrastructure is built by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| It does not cost the taxpayer one penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Yes, we may have to repay in 20 to 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| but the average home would probably pay $400 a year in taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| so that will more than cover the time that paving has to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| But the public needs to understand that when a subdivision is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| the taxpayer is not doing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Not one penny of tax money goes to infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| It's all paid before by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=841)|

| 0:18:36| we've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| I'm fortunate enough to be on the Fire and Rescue Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| which I understand a lot of things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| But first let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| This is not to blame anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| We are in a COVID situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| It's not the hospital's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| It's not AMR's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| It's not the medical doctor's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| It's just where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| We have people going to the emergency rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| that is backing things up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| and it's hurting the response times for the AMR group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| It's hurting in our hospitals because we're overworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| We're losing nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Every day I was at the doctor today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| and my doctor had five nurses out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Can you imagine five nurses out in a doctor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| what the backup was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Again, it's not anybody's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| It's just something that we've got to work through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| and I think that we're working through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Josh, I appreciate the Zoom call that you and I had the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| with Mr. Cohen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Just a little history that you gave to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| Pre-COVID pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| the drop-off time was around 30 minutes at a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Thirty minutes, you know, you can drop them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| In 2022, there was 36,000 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| that averaged almost 56 minutes to five hours a day per drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| In 2019, there's only 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| That's 36,000 extra hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| that they're standing there waiting to drop off a patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| And Josh will tell you here in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| they're not required to wait 30 minutes, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Josh can confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| These hours cost AMR over 17,000 unit hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| and these 17,000 unit hours is approximately 1.2 million in payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| Is that correct, Josh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| May I call you Josh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Since 2020, in response to the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| AMR's investments and expenditures in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| through our COVID-19 recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| has been over $5,100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| that they have spent to try to alleviate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| some of the problems that we're having at the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| And COVID is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| We weren't here for the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| nobody's here for the Spanish flu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| so we don't know how that went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| but we know we don't want to go through another one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Josh has said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| they have internally funded COVID-19 recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| and action plan to sustain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| and to launch a stabilized, current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| and foreseeable challenge that affects the performance times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| Some of the things that they've already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Josh, staffing and training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| you did $2.6 million in wage increases for the first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| That was in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| And that's come without a rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| $1.6 million in stipends and shift incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| to support and sustain the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| We're already getting close to that $5.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| $600,000 in recruitment and retention bonuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| for new EMTs and paramedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| So that's a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| just for retentions and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| This is one that I really like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| and I've been, fortunately, to one or two of the graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| $300,000 in training and certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| of nearly 50 new EMTs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| through the Earn While You Learn program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Explain that real quickly for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| what the Earn While You Learn program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Our Earn While You Learn program was launched, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| several years ago, kind of pre-pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| to essentially hire employees or folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| that are interested in getting into EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| And we basically put them through school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| and pay them hours worked while they're in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| hence the name Earn While You Learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| in exchange for an agreement to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| to work for us for a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| And I think in the last 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| we've put about 50 people through that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| And it does work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| but when they're leaving on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| for all the other reasons of COVID and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| it's hard to, you know, we're kind of spinning our tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| and not making a lot of traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| But it's an investment that we certainly believe is prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| and wise to make on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Well, anything you can do to help alleviate that is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Infrastructure Innovation and Systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| you tell us what the quick response vehicle, or the QRV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| I know what it is, but I don't know if anybody out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| if you hear the QRV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| this is a quick response vehicle that AMR has set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Yeah, and this board actually approved that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| I think, several months ago to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| But essentially, the quick response vehicle is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| we have two to three paramedics every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| and it's like a Tahoe-type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| I think it's a Ford F-150, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| that they actually, you know, go to the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| and try to eliminate whether or not have an ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| an ALS ambulance go to that scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| or if a BLS ambulance is appropriate for that patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Every 911 caller still gets an ALS assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| meaning a paramedic must be on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| But that quick response vehicle is able to be kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| quite literally that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| quickly responding in communities and areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| where we can't get an ambulance too quick enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Most importantly, or most likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| is they're delayed in transfer of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| at an offloading facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| And that was a $150,000 investment by AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| ET3 telemedicine, which I chose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| last week I chose telemedicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| instead of sitting in a hospital for 24 to 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| Tell us about your ET3 telemedicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Yeah, that and our nurse navigation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| is really geared at getting the right care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| to the right patient at the right time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| and not having those patients go to an emergency department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| or somewhere where that's going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| clog up the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| What's really neat about the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| especially with the nurse navigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| is we're working very hard to get contracts set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| with federal qualified health care clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| for patients who may or may not have Tennessee Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| or things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| We can take them to that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| where they can be seen by a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Not only do they get seen for their low-acuity illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| but we also make sure they work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| and get them set up for a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| that will help them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Those are only for low-acuity calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| priority 3-type calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| where we actually offer them a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| At the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| if the patient dialing 911 still requests an ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| they still will get an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| But we do offer them another layer of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| which is a nurse and a teledoc visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| That program, we even contract with Lyft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| That program can even take that patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| to their primary care doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| stop by the pharmacy on their way home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| pick up the medicine, and bring them back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Again, the initial rationale behind that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| is to not have patients dialing 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| for symptoms that can be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| or handled via other routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| That's the premise behind nurse navigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| ET3, and telemedicine all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I believe this was a pilot program here in Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Was this the pilot program started in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Now, nurse navigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| we've done in several other communities, ET3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| AMR was awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| That's a CMS grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| We were awarded to help kind of fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| And AMR as a whole across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| were awarded 67, I think, of the 200 or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| that were approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Yeah, I know we all have got phone calls or emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| And I know I got one from Commissioner Oster's constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| that was concerned about a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| from to ENT to E911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| and it was not a high-level emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| so it was like 10, 11 hours or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| And my suggestion to people that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| and if you're listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| try telemedicine, try urgent care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| and if you at all possible can get yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| get that person in a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| get that person in a car and take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Take them to the urgent care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| or to the emergency room or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| because if someone's having a heart attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| or somebody's in a car wreck or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| their priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| If you fall, call the, if there's a fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| call the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| They'll come out and help you get back up and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| So we've just got to be, we've got to start watching it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| and I think the telemedicine is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| Discharge lounges at UT Medical Center and Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| this was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| And you guys are staffing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| So far it's cost you $92,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| AMR, $92,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| The $92,000 is our surge units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| not necessarily the discharge lounges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Just in payroll along this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| which the surge units are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| if we have an ambulance at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| or five ambulances at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| according to if they're a low-acuity type patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| that we cannot put them in a bed or in a wheelchair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| or in the lobby if it's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| we'll have one ambulance watch all five of the ambulance's patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| there in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| That way we can get four ambulances back in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| That's a pretty common practice across our industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| and our medical directors have approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| and we have that offload policy approved with the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| But we're staffing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Those are our employees, AMR's employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| that are staffing those surge units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| which is obviously incurring a payroll cost for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| but that's one more unit that's not out on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| running 911 calls when we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| And explain your staffed surge support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| It's $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Yeah, the discharge lounge, we basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| patients, a lot of times the ER backup is due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| because there's nowhere for the patient to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| The rooms aren't available on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| so we encourage the facilities to take those patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| they know they're going to leave sometime that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| place them in a discharge lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| That way you clear up the bed upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| it can get the patient from the ER upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| and then we staff the discharge lounge that we're soon going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| eventually we'll be taking those patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| that need to go on ambulance home to their nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| assisted living, or wherever they may be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| So that does help free up the system a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| because it keeps the throughput kind of moving a little faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| We do staff that, again, at our expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| just to try to solve the problem of the ER overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| Just a few numbers on your nurse navigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Your initial setup was $158,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| $50,000 additional investment in equipment and the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| so that's $208,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| And then since March of this year you spent $12,000 a month staffing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| You and I also talked about transportation of the forensic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| the cost of that, and you had a couple of suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Madam Chair, I would like to suggest that we have a workshop on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| because there's some great ideas out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| I was just told from one that Commissioner Fraser has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| that she can expound on here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| There's areas out there, I think, that none of us are experts in medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| but we've got people out there that can give us suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| If we have a good, I'm not talking an hour workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| I'm talking about a three-, four-hour workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| that we need to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Joshua, give me your idea, a couple of your ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| and Commissioner Fraser, what her idea was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| on transporting bodies to the forensic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| One of the challenges, again, back to the dated contract in 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| when this contract was signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| as part of the agreement the ambulance provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| was in charge of transporting decedent transports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| decedent patients, at the request of the forensic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| That cost us a substantial amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| not only in equipment and supplies, but also in payroll to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| Initially we were probably doing two or three a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| As I understand, I wasn't here in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| but I was told we were doing two or three of those decedent transports a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| There are days now we do as many as 15 in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| I know in conversations I've had with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| there is interest, I think, in the new RFP cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| of that being removed or another way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| In the meantime, I would certainly encourage us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| to take an opportunity to look and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| what ways are there that we can offload that to a different department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I know we've got several ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| I'm certainly not going to steal anyone's thunder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| but I think that's a conversation that could and should be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| to keep our ambulances available for actual patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| that need them immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| And each transport has to have a body bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| It can be only used one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Which is, what, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| They're $100 plus usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| You can just expound on this a little bit as much as you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Then we'll go to Kevin and Mr. Vanderbeek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| Me and Knox County, we have five hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| and we have a lot of patients that come from surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| and I would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| If I lived in Monroe County or Pinterest or Scott or even Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| I would be on my way to UT or Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Give us a process that when an ambulance from out of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| comes into the hospital, give us a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Is there a standard there that the hospital uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| I'm not real sure on the hospital exact protocol on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| and I think that's a question that will be best maybe answered by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| However, we have seen and do often see, especially if we're surging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| as I mentioned earlier, we can only surge our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| So the patients that we're taking control of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| or taking care of while they're at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| those are only the patients that AMR actually brings to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| If another ambulance provider in another county brings a patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| we cannot surge those because that's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Oftentimes we see, and again, depending on the type of situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| it's not uncommon for us to see those outlying or surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| kind of go essentially skip ahead of us in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| mainly because we're over here watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| we're helping kind of solve the problem by surging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| I think some of that is, I think the rationale behind some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| is because they may only have one or two ambulances in their county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| They may not have a hospital in their county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Again, I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| I think it's appropriate that they be coming to these facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| which we have wonderful care here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| But it does kind of put us at a little bit of a disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| when it comes to offloading our patients and getting ready for the next call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| if surrounding agencies are kind of getting treated with preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| and the ER bed's availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Now, I will say, we do not typically have a problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| For those high-acuity patients, those that are really, really sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| having an active heart attack, a bad trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| there's beds available for those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| They go straight back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Those aren't the ones that we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| It's kind of the in-between, those that kind of fall between the cracks, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Those fairly sick but not sick enough to need to go into ER bed right immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| those are the ones that seem that we're having trouble with waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Some cannot sit in a wheelchair because they're bed-bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| but they don't necessarily need to be in the ER at that moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| so we oftentimes find ourselves sitting with those patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| holding them a little bit longer than we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Like I said, shared with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| our average in the month of November was about 57 minutes total at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| with each patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| I've seen them as long as five hours and as short as eight or nine minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| depending on the acuity of the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| Josh, anything else you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Mr. Parton, do you want to follow up on that or is it any of those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| especially the one about surrounding counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Like I say, if I lived in a surrounding county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| I would be coming to the best hospital I could come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I also can't speak for hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| The conversations I do have with them, they go through a triage just like we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| You go into the ER, they determine your sickness level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| and then that's how they determine who goes when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| But outside of that, I can't speak to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| Mr. Vanderveet, you can approach too there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| I know you guys had, you gentlemen, had a meeting this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| or over the weekend about the level zeroes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| and looking at forgiving some of the penalties or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| Could you give us an update on that and where we stand in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| The reason I made the motion to, since no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| whether through this discussion I'd like to have your opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| do we need to send it back to have the resolution clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| or do we just go ahead and try to make a motion or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| I'd rather have it clarified to make sure that we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| I guess I'd leave that to the discretion of the Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| Amendment 10, that is before you, waives penalties under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| I'm going to do this from memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| but I believe it's the time response penalties under Section 704 of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| What's been discussed is additionally extending the waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| to the level zero penalties covered under Section 705.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| I think that with 704 already on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| we would be comfortable with an amendment to the resolution simply incorporating 705,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| but, again, I'd leave that to the discretion of the Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| as to whether or not he considered that a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| Did you hear that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I did, and we have been going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| We don't care about the policy, whatever this board wants to do on the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| but getting the wording because we're getting a contract in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Charlie Sturkey is our contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| He's worked hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| He said, I don't know what to do now because it's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| So everything's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| He just left it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| I mean, no one talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| So we don't really know from a legal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| It's not the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| It's the fine print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| So I think we need to wait until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| Leave it as no recommendation and then clear it up for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| Dwight, I appreciate the information on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Could you go over the penalty phases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Actually, one of the great things about my job is that I get attached to really good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| that's been done by other skilled professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| In this case, Mr. Parton had worked on that tabulated data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| We were running through it in the office today for several hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| So I'll let him speak to it, but I just wanted to recognize I think this is a nuanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| and complicated process, and Kevin has done a great job, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| putting this data in really approachable terms that are easier for those of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| that don't deal with it on a daily basis to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| So if it's okay with you, though, I'd rather he walk you through the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| It is, Kevin, and I appreciate all this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| The two things that I'd like to see is that the public, AMR has spent over $6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| on trying to solve this problem, and we've got fines here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| There's no one out there except for an airline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| It'll lose billions and millions and millions of dollars and still stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| So the reason I brought all this forward is to, number one, what are the penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| and what should we forgive will we be forgiving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Because if we don't, we're not going to have an ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| I don't care who it is, priority, AMR, Lifeline, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| We've got to do something here until we can get this new contract in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| to where hopefully the good Lord willing COVID will go away somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| So thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| So if we start with the amendment itself, Josh is correct in the bottleneck at the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| So we crafted the amendment to try to take into account that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| So if a hospital is a status of yellow, it would be his ambulance would be on hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| basically from one hour to two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| They can almost bet on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| If it were to go to red, it's a two-hour delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| So what we did was attempt to craft it to where when we see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| we know there is zero chance that his ambulance has quick turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| So if three of the five hospitals are at yellow or red, we forgive the penalties to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| including these level zeros that currently occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| So penalty structure in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| So if you call 911, we basically have a time limit of 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| That's the goal is for them to be there 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| And from 17 minutes to 19 minutes, it's $250 a minute as a penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| And it progresses over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Really what we're here talking about is our level zero penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| So how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| So all of AMR's ambulances are currently tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| That's perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| But as soon as 911 gets a call, that's immediately a level zero, immediately a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| In the instance which is a majority of the time, they will also not make their time limit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| So that increases to $5,000 for each one of those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| So imagine super busy hospital, incredibly busy night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| Those can amass very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| In fact, in October, there were 237 level zeros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| That in itself is over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| They still respond to all those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| It's just a matter of that initial call, there wasn't somebody there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| so they immediately get penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| So that's where the discussion of level zeros being eliminated has come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| From a fine relief, if we look at Amendment 9, previously passed by the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| we waived $1.2 million worth of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| And that was December through April of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| From an Amendment 10 standpoint, if you go with as we have it proposed now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| we would forgive an additional $3.9 million worth of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| If you were to amend the current to eliminate level zeros in their entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| the total relief would be $4.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| That would go from June to October, and that would also move forward until January of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2550)|
| 0:42:39| That will be until the new contract is determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| We currently have, we're finishing up the RFP process to have a consulting service come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Survey the current system as it is and give us appropriate recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| from like a nationwide standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| And when three of the five hospitals are below the yellow or the red?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| The penalty phase kicks back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| It does, yes, currently it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| And Josh understands that, that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| There's still a bar there that's got to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| And it's not a freebie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| But we have to do something right now to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I want to see that we have an ambulance system for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| Mr. Schoonmaker and a couple of others that we've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| there's two things they'll tell you at the TCCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| You don't want to be an ambulance business and you don't want to be in a fire business as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| And I guarantee you we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you very much, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Director Pardon, again, I'm going to reference this document that you presented to us just prior to the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| On the chart, the first part, the December through April, the $750,500 in penalties assessed, have those been paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2638)|
| 0:44:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| And who receives those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| And then does it go into your department's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| It goes back to the general fund, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| We budget approximately $80,000 a fiscal year in penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| And then in the second, well, no fines have been assessed or collected from June through October, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2665)|
| 0:44:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| And we have performed compliance as if Amendment 10 were to pass, so that's how I have what would be the proposed penalties to assess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2678)|
| 0:44:48| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| And then is the paperwork that's in our packet, is that correct as of today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| Or is that now going to change with this part here that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| The proposed with level zero eliminated, that should be accurate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| There's the possibility, depending upon what the body does, it could obviously change, but these should be your numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| And then the 2013 contract, has that actually been provided to the commission previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| I'm sure that it has, but I'm happy to share it with the body again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| This is for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| When you're, if you've got, since we've got five hospitals in Knox County, if two of those hospitals are in the yellow and the other three are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2738)|
| 0:45:52| does your dispatch, when a call comes in, send those to the non-busy hospitals if the insurance and all that can handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2752)|
| 0:46:05| So we recommend to the patients, first of all, it's the patient's discretion, whichever hospital they want to go to, that's where we're always going to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2765)|
| 0:46:13| We do inform them at times if there's going to be extended wait because of the status of the hospital being red or yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| and then try to essentially see if there's another opportunity that may meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| But overall, it's ultimately the patient's decision, but dispatch does let us know when a hospital is on a red or yellow status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| But the patient is not responsible for any of the additional fines because they want to go to that hospital that's in a yellow or red zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| You guys cover that, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| And then I just had a quick question for financial or procurement, but maybe Dwight could answer it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| We postponed the consultant search until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| Can we just not fine anybody that would fit that bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| Oh, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| I think the process is going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| It's just the glacial pace of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| We have a review committee of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| One of the things we've done that we think is going to bring particular value is Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Parton has recruited a representative of the area hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| We think it's really important that they be at the table, and there is a representative of the Knoxville Fire Department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| So between coordinating those external schedules and coordinating internal schedules and getting proposals back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| it's just a matter of hours in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| So, no, we'll be before the body with the recommendation of the consultant in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| And Commissioner Daley, you were quoting some data and numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Is that information that can be sent to all of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Yes, I'll send it to Drew, and then Drew will report it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| The only question I really have with this stuff is you said you had 237 calls that you guys were basically late to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Level zero occurred 237 times last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| So, and I don't know ambulance speak, so help me out here so I can better understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| When there's a heart attack or a stroke, is that considered level zero as well, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| Level zero means how many ambulances we have available, so we're at level zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| So when there's a stroke, which is time-sensitive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Is there a priority list where that gets bumped up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| Oh, yeah, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Those are priority one responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| So that's the highest acuity call, a stroke, heart attack, you know, major trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| Those are all priority one responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| So if we're at level zero and then there's a priority one that comes in, a stroke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| are we just waiting until we get a free ambulance to go out there, which might be an hour or two hours even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| and that person's already stroked out and done at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| First of all, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Once a priority one call comes in, our crews try to kind of figure out any way or place to put the patient that they may be held up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| We send a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| The QRV program will go to that call and start administering care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| We still respond to the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| When we're at level zero, and I don't want to quote this data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| but I think our delayed of our priority one times are probably five or six minutes longer than if we have trucks available and are not at level zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| We're still going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| Instead of taking 10 minutes, it may take 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| My personal opinion is I get that we're under crazy circumstances, you know, in this post-COVID world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| I'm okay with seeing some of these fines waived or restructuring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| The only place I would like to see them be kept are on those priority one type calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| I still think you guys should be held to a level of standard that if it's a critical injury, like if it's a stroke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| that's the easiest example I can think of off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| that you guys should still be held to a standard to get there in an accurate amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I don't know if we're talking about not having that or having that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| but that is something that I think is important because those are such time-sensitive issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| Commissioner, word of a might, that certainly is the prerogative of this commission as the resolution comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| Let me do say, though, that remember that the ambulance provides two functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| It provides patient care and it provides transport for all of those calls, city, county, those within car and service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3034)|
| 0:50:43| those within rural metro service area, and 70% of them are in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| A fire engine is always dispatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Typically it's going to be the first responder on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| The fire engine will almost always get there before the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Most of those will have a paramedic on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Occasionally it will be tough to staff a paramedic and they'll just have an advanced EMT or somebody with EMT certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| but in most cases the fire engine will have a paramedic on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| So I don't want the commission to think that the patient is just laying there without some standard of patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| Obviously a fire engine isn't going to take you to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| but at least somebody there with skills and training and equipment is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| and is on scene to provide care while the ambulance is en route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Isn't that kind of the root of the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| The ambulance is the one that takes them to the hospital, so if they're the one late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| the paramedic is going to do all they can in the field, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| They'll give them the injections and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| but the whole goal for a stroke patient is you're on a clock as soon as the stroke happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| and that clock ticks down until your time runs out and there's permanent damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| So the whole point of this contract is for this kind of circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| where the penalty is put in place for when there's a stroke victim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| that they get there in an accurate amount of time to get them to the hospital in an accurate amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| so they can beat that window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| If we're not holding them to that standard, it's not okay in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| I get that there might be a fire truck that shows up to help out, to hold them over and hold their hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| but you've got to get them to the hospital as quickly as humanly possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| So in those types of circumstances, I still think there should be a penalty held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| because that should be the standard of care our citizens should expect from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| I don't think we should lax those situations just because they're having a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| I still think those situations are very real, and we want to take them as seriously as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| not saying that they're not, but I still think there should be a standard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| I think it would be our goal for all priority one patients commissioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| whether it's trauma, heart attack, stroke, whatever the event might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| is the fastest response and the fastest transport possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| So we don't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| It has just been very difficult under the circumstances that we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| and that they have had with multiple trucks on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| So that's why Kevin's model was predicated on three of five being at red or yellow status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| If it's less than that, then we expect AMR to have trucks available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| and we expect those trucks on the scene within the time parameters of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| I just don't think the stroke victim or their family cares if they're at red or yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| I think our citizens don't care either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| I think they want us to hold your company to a standard if you're going to do business with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| When it's these kind of situations, we should be held to a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| I get if it's a lower priority call, broken arm, stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| you're a little late, you're a little late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| but when it's a stroke and things of this similar nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| I think we should still have a penalty involved that they're not there on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| That's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Maybe not everybody shares that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| I appreciate you coming and taking the time to meet with us and try to explain some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| and I also get the fact that everybody's having hard times right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| I mean, you can name any business or industry pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| and they're struggling with employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| I didn't have the advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I don't think I'm getting the copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| I didn't have the advantage, Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| of getting the copy of those numbers you were reading that AMR has spent on trying to improve the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3266)|
| 0:54:38| Did I hear you say $2.6 million in salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3278)|
| 0:54:47| And that's over how many months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| That's an annualized wage adjustment, wage increase that we did for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| So that $2.6 million, that is annualized over the course of the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| So to be clear then, all of our first responders that work for you all collectively in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3303)|
| 0:55:12| they're making $2.6 million more than they did this time last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3312)|
| 0:55:20| We invested $2.6 million into a market adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Some employees may have got 7% or 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| Some may have gotten 30%, but the annualized cost of that is $2.6 million, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Well, thank you for helping pump that extra money into us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| And the $1.6 additional million in training, so did you double your training or triple your training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3337)|
| 0:55:51| What made that number as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| I think the $1.6 was due to stipends and bonuses and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| When we were certainly in the midst of our workforce difficult time, we offered multiple shift incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3360)|
| 0:56:09| and we still do, you know, bonuses, night and weekend shift differential, all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| And that was where that $1.6 million came from, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| So given the significant investment that you have made, have things changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| Are response times any shorter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Are there more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Have you provided more ambulances actually available to put on the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| I think it has gotten a little better the last couple months specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| largely due to some changes we made internally with shift types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| We offered various shifts that we seem to be more appealing to the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| We have a more consistent scheduling program now to make sure we're working 24-7 to fill the ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| But, you know, there are days where it's difficult to find staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| There are days when we have plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| One day recently I think we had north of 25 ambulances on the road at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| That's a great number in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| We also had a large majority of them sitting at the hospital during that time as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| because obviously that's where they're going and that's going to cause a delay to even bottleneck further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| But we have seen some improvements in staffing, again, back to the Earn While You Learn program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| That's also helping with our recruitment retention efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| So we've made substantial investments in solving the problem to the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| We feel like we've offered and tried multiple different things to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| But right now I think there's not a whole lot of things left that we can do other than what we're already doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| and continue to do to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And I do hear that, and I appreciate that you all have looked hard into trying to remedy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3475)|
| 0:58:06| So if I were to see a wage printout of what your folks here in Knox County were making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3486)|
| 0:58:16| and put it up against other first responders in Knox County, it would be equal to or better than?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3496)|
| 0:58:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| I'm not 100 percent sure what the fire departments are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| I think we're one of the highest ambulance providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| We're one of the highest paid in the area that we're aware of, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Do I understand that you're only required, I think I heard Mr. Cohn say, 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| that you are required to stay with a patient once it reaches the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| Is that a law or where did that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| 30 minutes is kind of industry standard on the amount of time it typically would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| to take a patient to an emergency department, put them in a bed, give a report to the nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| make sure all the patient's belongings are taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| clean up the ambulance and get ready for the next call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Thirty minutes is kind of the industry standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| But here lately it's been nearly double that on an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Is there any kind of a fee that the hospitals pay to the ambulance service for any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3558)|
| 0:59:28| when you have an employee sitting there for three or four hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| Director Holden, you may be able to answer this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| It's my understanding that there's a Tennessee statute that says that once an ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| enters the hospital property, that is now under the jurisdiction of the hospital, that patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3595)|
| 1:00:03| Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| That's a federal law, yes, not state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| It's federal then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Oh, okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| So based on what Commissioner Hill was saying, is there any other entity in Tennessee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3614)|
| 1:00:22| provides ambulance service that's coming in to the emergency room, dropping the gurney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3622)|
| 1:00:30| with the patient on it, doing the paperwork for 30 minutes, leaving without the gurney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| going to a central facility, picking up another gurney to be able to go on another emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| call, so you're not just sitting there, since it's now the jurisdiction of the hospital's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| responsibility once you've entered their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| I'm not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| I know the state does have a state-approved offload policy that many agencies do use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3653)|
| 1:01:02| Basically, for a certain acuity of patients, they do have an offload policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| The problem is there's not always a bed available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| So I'm not aware of any other agencies that are doing, as you just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| But if you left the gurney there with the patient on it and then just picked them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| at the end of the shift or whatever, the end of the next day, do you see where I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Because it's their responsibility to work it in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| It's patient abandonment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Not if it's the hospital's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| So essentially, because of the problem, and I think this is the best way I can explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| it, and pardon the simplicity, we could do exactly as you just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| This is all hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| I don't believe that's the best thing for the patient, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| And so we all are here to take care of the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| And at times, we could, depending on the acuity of the patient, essentially put them in a bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| a gurney, and give report to the nurse and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| The law does permit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| But it feels an awful lot like patient abandonment to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| So we try to avoid that if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| But then you go to Commissioner Ward's question where you've got a serious situation and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| got an ambulance sitting at a hospital that could be picking up that person at a reasonable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| And those are typically when we do the surge, when our patients begin to watch our own crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| members' patients so we can get our ambulances back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| That's usually when the surge units are deployed in that scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| Thank you, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Thank you, Amar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| You all have been a longstanding, really great community partner providing an essential service to our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| and I want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| It's a sad and challenging time for all emergency service agencies as well as health care personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| I live with one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| So I kind of understand that you all are kind of stuck with trying to look at penalties versus patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3793)|
| 1:03:21| Being in the business of patient care as a former health care administrator, it's very tough, especially now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| And one thing that I keep hearing over and over again, and I know I said this to many of you that I've had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| conversations with, it's time for the hospitals to come to the table and do their part to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3815)|
| 1:03:43| What this body may not know is AMR did try to take a harder stance with some of our hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3823)|
| 1:03:51| and that just didn't go very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| We received a lot of phone calls because they are our contracted service provider for ambulance services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| and so it does tend to fall back on us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| However, I think our community hospitals could do a little better about coming to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| and actually having this very difficult discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| As Commissioner Daley suggested, I can't take any credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| It really came from a conversation at the Fire and Rescue Task Force committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| just sticking around and talking to some of those folks who are current emergency agency partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| that maybe going forward just a simple request that I had was that we look at carving out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| some of the components of what AMR does, and that is deceased transports as well as mental health transports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| and maybe we have other agencies that we currently work with that can take on that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3886)|
| 1:04:54| So that's something that we're going to look at, putting in the forthcoming RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| and hopefully that will alleviate some of those transports and free up some of the ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| That's really all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| To Commissioner Ward's point, all emergency service agencies must retain some measure of performance standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3909)|
| 1:05:19| and I think that's what he's saying is that we still want to retain a measure of performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| and I think we can find a compromise and come to the table and that we can make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| that we are providing adequate services to our citizens as well as keeping your doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3930)|
| 1:05:41| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Is there any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3951)|

| 1:06:31| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Just for clarification, the Mayor is saying that he wants to discontinue it of June 30 of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| and in the previous resolution you want to extend it until January of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| Yes, sir, and if I could, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| if the body approves the prior resolution, then we would withdraw this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| The 803 letter, this comes out of these conversations that we've had with Mr. Sturkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| the 803 letter becomes irrelevant if Amendment 10 with the extension to January 31 of 2024 passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4022)|
| 1:07:11| So if we could actually just defer this to next week with that recommendation, we would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| If Amendment 10 with the extension does not pass, then we would ask for an affirmative vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| If some version of Amendment 10 does pass, then we would withdraw this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| I'll change my motion to say with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| Second is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4052)|

| 1:09:07| in support of workforce training efforts in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| Is there a motion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| Motion to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4154)|

| 1:09:26| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| The reason I had asked to have this pulled is, is there anyone from the chamber here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4172)|
| 1:09:43| Thank you, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| With your permission, Madam Chair, may I have him come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| I know that my concern is that we don't begin to set a precedence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4191)|
| 1:10:01| I know that not too long ago this body approved additional government funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| to help with some additional training on companies that were coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| or were already established at the recommendation of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4213)|
| 1:10:22| I know this is a very small amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| When this type of thing happens, since the recommendation is coming from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| that it proposes this to start with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Just for the record, my name is Doug Loyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Vice President of Economic Development with the Knox Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| As part of our economic development efforts, we like to say first and foremost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| we start with existing industries and expansions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| so we've got a lot of efforts to work with our existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| And so this was a recommendation coming from the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| to get these workforce training funds to support this particular expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| So to be clear, do you go to the business and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| oh, if you all need more money, we'll ask county government for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| If you need money to train more of your employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| Well, really, the way we approach any expansion, as well as a new recruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| more and more the conversation is starting with talent and talent attraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| and talent retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| And so anything we can do as a community to bring resources to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| to support companies that are looking to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| that is something that we are wanting to partner with both the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| to support these efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| So it's not like we go say, hey, we can get you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Kind of the litmus test that we've been using is, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| these are for projects that are paying above our county average annual wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| which today is roughly $57,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| And so this particular expansion that we're talking about is paying well above that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| just over $74,000 per job for advanced manufacturing positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| So that's kind of our first thing is what is the pay scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| So this is not for every project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| This is for those kind of specific high-impact projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| that are looking at expanding or locating in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| So as I understand, this is a company that's already located here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| So is the – and I hate to be so blunt about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| but I do not want this to become a habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| I don't think that it's necessarily good practice once a business is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| And I think that this body is very generous in TIFs and pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| and bending over backwards with trainings to try to get new growth and development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4378)|
| 1:13:06| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| We all get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| But I do have concerns when, after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| a business via the chamber is coming back and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| well, you know, if you will do this, we will do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| especially a business that it's established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| And I don't even know about this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| This isn't directed at this one personal business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| But, I mean, so if we say no, we're not going to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| then is the business saying, well, we're not going to pony up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| and train people for our business that clearly it benefits us to do it too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| I mean, we cannot be a bottomless pit of providing more money for more training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| for established businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| Yeah, and I go back to the this is not for every deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| This is not for every project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| This is for those that are paying well above our county average wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| and that are in a competitive situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| This is an expansion that really could have gone to other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| And we actually have a representative from the company here, John Aaron Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| who is the president and general manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| that maybe could talk a little bit about what training dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| if allocated by this body to the IDB, could do to support that expansion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| You're welcome to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| And, again, I'm not against the idea per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| but I do have real concerns about coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| And most people, their workforce, if it's your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| you take the responsibility of training your people for your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| So, yes, I'd love to hear what you have to say, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| Sir, please state your name for the record and your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| John Aaron Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Would you care to, and you know this isn't personal, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| Oh, I understand, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Tell me what that $40,000 would be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| So, for us, it allows us to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| and hire more entry-level type employees and bring them into the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| We have our own side of the training that we have to do inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| There's not a public entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Okay, I'm having a little bit of a hard time hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| So the $40,000 would help us bring in more entry-level type employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| So these are kids out of high school, out of tech schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| who maybe don't have all the training and direction they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| For us, we do a good bit of training inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Our process is so unique that we don't really have an outside partner yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| that we can go to for training, like a TCAD or a Pellissippi or a Rhone State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| But there are some competencies that we do that we can partner with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| so like CNC machining, industrial maintenance, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| So that gives us a leg up to be able to go and bring those folks in at zero experience in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| train them up with the local schools and resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| and be able to take them from an entry-level position making $20 an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| up to $30 an hour within a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| So if you look at the number of folks that it allows us to bring in quickly, you look at 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| We started the year with 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| We're at 45 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Within two or three years, we'll be at 100 at this new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| And that was the big incentive is there's a workforce here that is capable of doing the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| but sometimes requires a little bit of extra training to get to the level that we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| And that's not a level that the business feels like they can assume as part of their business expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4599)|
| 1:16:50| I mean, just the cost of doing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Sure, and we have a good bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| But what we like to do is partner with the community as well, so being able to work with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| This is a wonderful incentive that helps us kind of point back to, hey, this is why we stayed in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| So before this expansion took place, like I said, 15, 20 people already went to 45 in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| We're bringing about 33 percent, give or take about a third of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| into Knox County from outside of the state, outside of the city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| But there was also other options for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| It was either going to go to Denver, Colorado, or Cincinnati, Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| So our push to keep it here was based on resources, the folks that are here, TCAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| Pellissippi, and all the other wonderful resources we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| So you used us because we already have so many things in place that are ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| And again, it isn't about the amount of money is not much at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| but it is just about the chamber's offer to do this when it's our dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4675)|
| 1:18:05| I mean, we give the chamber a lot of money every year, a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| and I just wish things like that might be a little bit more in the future looked at with great care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4690)|
| 1:18:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| If you don't mind, I think I'll yield right now to Commissioner Lee and Commissioner Schoomaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| and then I'll finish up with that because I actually visited the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| so I wanted to be able to share some of my things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I kind of am on the same sentiment as Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| I think we're kind of the gatekeepers of the tax dollars of the taxpayers of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| and I understand there's going to provide some jobs, and that's all fair and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| My concern is your payroll is going to be substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| The $40,000, I don't see how that, what do you need the $40,000 for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| and what is the criteria of the people that are able to come and get the training at your facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| So we would aim this more at entry-level folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| So once again, kids coming out of high school, potentially coming out of a trade school already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| whether that be a TCAT system or one of the local community colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| So that's really where we would aim the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Not only that, but that's going to also kind of help us build those relationships as we reach out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| We've already worked with TCAT on a couple of students and a couple of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| but we want to go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| We want to go into the community colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| So it's not just about hiring technical labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| It's more about, hey, now we need to go after, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| maybe we need to set a kid back for an associate's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| or some sort of technical-type degree in these community college settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| So that's where we would target the use of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Yes, it's a small amount, but we're a growing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| We're making heavy investments in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Every dollar counts in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| So this would be a huge boost to our training budget this year and going into next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| And how did you come up with the $40,000 figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| How did you come up with the $40,000 figure that you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| That wasn't actually the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| That was just a recommendation from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| We've been using $500 per job as a number that we think makes good sense to support training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4825)|
| 1:20:34| So in that case, $500 per job, this project is talking, I think, 74 net new jobs every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4834)|
| 1:20:42| So that gets you to the $39,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| So the chamber came up with that figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I may have missed, what is the name of the company that you work for, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| Beehive Industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| And is Beehive Industries, is your physical location within the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| The county of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| It is in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Would you like me to yield to Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Just really quickly, I wanted to say that I forwarded to Drew a great email from Mr. Lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| that it has some great explanation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| I also wanted to just make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| The chamber is now our Economic Development Corps, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| I'm sorry, the question again, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| The chamber is now our Economic Development Corps, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| So you're in the business of recruiting businesses to stay in Knox County, grow in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| come to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| It has to do with business attraction, business retention and expansion that is in our wheelhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| So some great projects that are, not projects, but relationships that this body has agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| to in the past with CGI at $150,000, HZI $35,000, Sparks at $40,000 and then currently Beehive at $39,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4929)|
| 1:22:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Have they all met your expectations or exceeded them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| So CGI and HZI, these are recent projects, so typically when we look at a project that announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4944)|
| 1:22:34| it's usually a three to five year window for that ramp up to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| So we're still a little early on some of those, but so far everything is trending along as we would have hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Thank you guys for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| I would invite every one of my commissioners to go to Beehive Industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| It actually sits in my district, so smack dab in the middle of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| I went for a wonderful presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| I have to be honest with you, I didn't understand everything they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| It was very technical, but they're the only company right now doing the stuff that they do for mainly DOE, military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=4990)|
| 1:23:21| that kind of stuff, if I'm correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| What is really exciting is they're getting ready to open a 62,000 square foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Right off of Dutchtown Road, right in the middle of my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| which means that we're going to have more houses to be sold in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| And we were just talking about that, how we need more housing and people to be able to afford them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| And we've got a great income base coming in here from Beehive Industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| I'm really impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| I understand the 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| I understand the questions from Commissioner Lee and Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| But I think that really is a small amount compared to what we're going to be bringing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| And I think Chris can probably attest to that also, because him and I discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| But, you know, we're going to be selling houses to people moving in that's going to be at Beehive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| They're also something they're doing that I love, and everybody's heard me say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| They are spending time trying to get our high school kids who may not want to go to college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| really interested in the business that they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| and being able to start them out at a really good rate, which I think is huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| get them into also a community college, and then they're focusing on UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| So they're not just focusing on bringing people from out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| They're focusing on our own people and our own kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| That's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| So I think $40,000 is kind of a great investment for what I feel like that this business is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| Is there anything you want to speak to on that, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Just a couple things, just to clarify something for Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| This isn't the chamber bringing it and wanting to spend our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| We actually communicate frequently with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| and have meetings about potential prospects for retention or attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5119)|
| 1:25:27| And so when these conversations happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| we have a conversation about how we can help with economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| And I think on a broader scale, whether we like it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| this is where we are as a country with economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| If you want to attract and retain good-paying jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| and jobs that you want in your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| you're going to have to extend some things for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| whether it's workforce training grants, whether it's TIFs or pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| You'll see this across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| And what businesses do is what they do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| And so you heard Mr. Lawyer say that our average pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| is about $57,000 a year here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| That's not where it needs to be, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| It needs to be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| So how do you get that pay higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| You do things like this to help attract and retain jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| that are making $74,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| And so these are things that the chamber is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| I'm fortunate enough to be on the chamber board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| so we get to see some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| And we're going to look at communities similar to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| who have really done a better job with economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| than we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| And so what we've got to do is work together to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| and move forward and make our community better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| by attracting and retaining these type of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Yeah, like I say, I think everybody should take a visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| I'm sure Doug would set that up for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| and be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Mr. Jones, I appreciate you being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| answering questions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| I appreciate you, Doug, for inviting me out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| It was exciting, and I'm looking forward to the ribbon cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| and getting this started out there on Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| So thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| Is there any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| Seeing none, the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| This is item number 41, Resolution 904,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| a resolution supporting the position of the Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| of Tennessee to protect the medical freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| of those serving in the Tennessee Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| and Air National Guard and Tennessee State Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| in urging the U.S. Congress to take appropriate action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| to remove and prohibit the Biden Administration's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| COVID-19 vaccine mandate on members of the U.S. Armed Forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5289)|
| 1:28:17| Motion to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Motion to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| by Commissioner Oster, with a second by Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| I actually have someone here that is going to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| It's Captain Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| He's the one that also did our Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| So you can go ahead and start if you'll state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| and then share with the Commission what you came here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| My name is Mickey Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I'm a captain in the 230th Sustainment Brigade out of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| So I just want to thank everybody for having me here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| and having the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| I do have to say these are my own opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| and not of the DoD U.S. Army or Tennessee Army National Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| But thank you, Commissioner Oster and Hill, for sponsoring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| and also the mayor, Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| I definitely appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| along with some of the governor's team and himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| which he recently came out and signed with 20 other governors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| on this very matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| We've had to switch up the resolution a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| because of the recent lifting of the mandate in the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| for the National Defense Authorization Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| So we're very thankful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Where are we left right now as far as service members here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| in the Tennessee Army National Guard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| I currently have soldiers after July 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| that were not allowed to attend drill because of the mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| Some of these soldiers that are not legally allowed to attend drill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| because of that mandate didn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| Some of those are single moms who may have had to use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| as a portion of their grocery bill to feed their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| maybe gas money to get to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| maybe potentially part of their mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| So I look out for my fellow service members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| men and women in uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| and it's very sad to me to see that they're still in limbo right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| even after that lift in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| And I'm not here as a Republican, a Democrat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| independent, libertarian, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| I'm here as a citizen, here to protect our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| I know we get a lot of misconception that service members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| we sign the dotted line, we don't have any rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| That's absolutely misguided. That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| We get equal opportunity rights, we get reprisal rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| redress with our commanders, among many other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| protections under UCMJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| So we do have rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| We've always followed regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| In this particular case, which has been ignored a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| is Army Regulation 40-562,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| which is the Army's Medical Command Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| In that, there's a table that explains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| that if you have natural immunity or antibodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| that you do not have to take that particular vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| So while we've ignored that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| this past go-around during the pandemic, I'm unsure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| So we've ignored our own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| So I hear a lot of, we have to, you know, obey orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| But if, you know, so people don't want to reward, they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| the service members that they think disobeyed this COVID mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| But they didn't disobey it, they were just following regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| But the Army and the Tennessee Army National Guard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| had their hands tied with the Biden administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| were not allowed to have immunity or be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Majority of the medical exemptions and religious exemptions were denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| or still in limbo, less than 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| Senior Army Medical Command officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| who were not able to speak out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| because they're afraid to lose their license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| are also in agreeance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| So this is all across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| I could not tell you how many soldiers from other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| especially here in our own state, here in Knoxville and Clarksville and Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| all over, Johnson City, from Seattle all the way to New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| has called me and they've either had heart attacks after taking it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| they've coughed up blood twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| I've had my own master sergeant have a blood clot in his leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| I've had soldiers who had to wear a heart monitor after the first dose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| and they were told, if you didn't get the second one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| we're going to boot you from the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| You know, we've been everyone's shield in times of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| And I think it's definitely important that we lift these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| because we have retention issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| People are leaving right and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Also, we have recruitment issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| which the Army hasn't even met up to a little over half of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| which is very alarming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| which I think affects a little over 1,000 here in our own state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| And if you look at that, it's a state and national security issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| With Iran, China, North Korea, Russia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| they're at our doorstep and they keep poking us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| So why are we decreasing our military over this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| So sometimes on the battlefield, you get two choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| and you have to mitigate those risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| And they could be two bad choices, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| Can we still achieve the objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| but at the same time, which direction can we lose the least amount of men?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| And so I think it's the same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| So I know a lot of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| there's been some cases where soldiers have died because of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| here in the Tennessee Army National Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| And that breaks my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| But also at the same time, we do have to be logical in the way we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and do a cost-to-benefit analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| How many soldiers have been permanently injured from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| or has also died as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| So I'm all for medical freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| just for us to be able to have the freedom as Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| to choose whether we put something in our body or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| According to the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| which is VAERS but for the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| there has been several hundreds of percentage points of increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| of Bell's palsy, microcarditis, pericarditis, infertility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| hormonal issues, shortness of breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| I could go on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| Some of those thousands of percentage points just since the mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| I think it's proof in itself in that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| which I think is underreported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| So with this resolution and those line items in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| it's to work along with the governor and our county officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| which the majority of the House and the Senate has been on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| which I've talked to, and the Senate and House leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| to encourage the attorneys general to file a lawsuit against the DOD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5653)|
| 1:34:22| and Obama administration on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| And all we want in encouraging that is just to have it go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| just to see the data, see the facts, and have a debate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| 90% of these cases against the DOD now has either been won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| or there's state orders now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Case in point, you look at Doe versus Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| If you read pages 13 through 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| even the DOD attorneys cannot refute this evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| And I go on record in saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| But, again, I've never been anti-vax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| I've always taken everything that the military has given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| And I wish I would have known that when I had to get the anthrax shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| before going over to the Middle East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| I was a little antsy about taking it in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| and then I had to go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| And I took it anyways because I wanted to serve my country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| I come back, and now I have vitiligo and autoimmune issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| And there's a reason why the first round of those doses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| and those lot numbers on anthrax, when it came out, was new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| But it was supposed to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| It was new, but we trusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Now people with those first round of lot numbers for anthrax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| have something called the Gulf War Syndrome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| and they're getting 100% disability, no questions asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| You just have to give it time to see the side effects of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| So there's no data, hardly at all, on this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| and why it's being suppressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| and why people are being kicked out or booted for their whole livelihoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| I've heard of cases of soldiers committing suicide over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| myself included, 11 years in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| I've talked to majors up at Joint Force Headquarters, 19 years in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and now they can't pass their education benefits to their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| They fought in so many deployments, spilt their blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| So I'm not trying to make this into a political thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| I'm just looking at the lives of my soldiers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| my fellow servicemen and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| I care for everyone in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| We've took enough to defend everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| So think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| Whether it's natural disasters, floods in Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| tornadoes in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| whether it's fires in Gatlinburg or hurricanes in Florida or a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| we respond to those things, or even riots in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| We have to respond to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| So without us, and we decreased that force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| and with an ever-encroaching enemy across the sea, what are we left with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| We're left in a dangerous position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| So just keep that in mind, and I hope that you will pass this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| and we can stand together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| I do believe this is a bipartisan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| So I do really advocate and hope that I could have your support in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| Not only would I be very appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I think all my servicemen and women that I serve with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| would be very, very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| If anybody has any questions, I wouldn't mind taking any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| If not, I appreciate the time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Commissioner Oster, do you have anything else to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| or would you like me to come back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Just come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Commissioner Oster and Hill, I would like to be added to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| and I would suggest that you make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5844)|
| 1:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| So I would love to sign Commissioner Daley up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| Yeah, and anybody else, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| I do believe that this would certainly look strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| and be important for Knox County to send this to our governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| Our governor is in support of this with 20 other governors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| He sent a letter to Congress and to DOD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Knox County can kind of lead by example, and I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| I believe that it was important enough that Mayor Jacobs wanted to sign on to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| and I was extremely appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| So thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| I just wrote an L down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| I just wanted to say thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| I give honor to all of our military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| and I appreciate you coming out here and speaking to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| and I would also like to make a motion to join in on this too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| because I support it wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| I certainly do not want to debate vaccines, mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| or go back in time for the last two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| but I do question the necessity of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| The National Defense Authorization Act, which has been passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| and is expected to be signed into law by the Commander-in-Chief this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| removes any COVID vaccine requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| This is going to happen likely well before any vote from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| I sort of challenge this commission to think about what is our role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| This is not something that's in our purview or our roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| and responsibility as Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| This is a federal and state-level responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| It's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| Things are moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| The purpose of what you're trying to achieve has already been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| or will be done in a matter of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| and really this has a look and a feel of sort of a purely political resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5990)|
| 1:39:59| that has virtually no legal teeth or responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| in what our charter says that our goal is as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| So I think it ought to be removed or tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| I don't think it's necessary for us to take action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you for those comments, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| and I appreciate them and respect your opinion on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| Hopefully you'll respect mine on bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| I want to go ahead and make sure that everybody in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| that's watching this, this was not brought to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| and it was also not brought by me as a political stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| My family goes back to General Bragg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6048)|
| 1:40:58| My family have deep, deep, deep military ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| And so for the men and women that we expect to go out and fight for our freedoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| we're telling them that they don't have a freedom to take a vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| that we have no idea whether they are okay to take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| or whether they're not okay to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| This is not for me to debate a vaccine with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| I'm saying that they have every right as an American citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| and as an American who is fighting for our freedom to decide what goes in their body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| So I take umbrage at the fact that it's even talked about being political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| because it's far beyond that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| I don't like to hear that we have men and women having heart attacks and strokes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| and they can't do their job anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| I might not have any purview federally or statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| but I'm going to stand with the people in District 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| that could be Tennessee National Guard or fought in our military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6126)|
| 1:42:13| I'm going to stand up as their commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| And I brought this forward because I felt strong enough about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| that they need to have the respect that we can show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| And as a commissioner in Knox County, that's what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| And anyone who wants to sign on, thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| If you don't want to sign on, I completely understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| but I wanted to make sure that it was on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| that this has nothing to do with politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| This has to do with what I feel personal about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| And I appreciate Captain Shelton for coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| I appreciate the people in Jefferson County who brought this to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| that's actually been reworded with the help of Jill and Mr. Moyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| and also Governor Lee's legislative liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| because even he said that it does have teeth for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| to stand up and back Governor Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| And so that's what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| And I would just ask that you support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| If it's okay to respond, Commissioner, directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| Commissioner, I do respect your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I, too, come from a long military family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| As a son of an Air Force veteran born on an Air Force base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| and a grandson of an Army World War II reconnaissance scout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| I understand more than you or others may know what that means to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| I think my statement, to clarify my statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| I want this commission to be really careful going down this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6239)|
| 1:44:06| when it comes to what is our role as a Knox County commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| and as the legislative body of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| Policy statements, resolutions like this that are not under our role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| and responsibility opens up the door to essentially having this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| opine on virtually everything that happens on a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| or federal or international level time and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| We've gone through this a couple times over the last four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| that I've been around the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| We have to ask ourselves, what are we responsible for doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| This would be different if it was connected to some particular policy issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| that we have the legal authority to do for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| I worry that if we're starting to make a statement about what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| on a state or federal level, then we're heading down the wrong way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| and we're not focusing on efforts that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| things that we can directly affect on a local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I would just like to say thank you for your words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| and also thank you, Mr. Britt, for your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| There are a lot of opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Through COVID, this was a tough conversation for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| but I always took the stance that I supported medical choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| and that whatever choice an individual made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| it should not prevent them from doing what they love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| Now that I have a husband who is in the Air Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| I would want him to have a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| and I wouldn't want that choice to keep him from doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| that he was called to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| And so I would like to leave that to the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| In saying that, this resolution, it's basically a statement on a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| and I don't see any harm in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| So I would like to sign on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6371)|

| 1:46:21| If I could say it as eloquently as you just did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| I just want to echo what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6384)|

| 1:46:40| The existing motion on the floor is no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| That was not changed by the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6408)|

| 1:48:22| Just for the body, a lot of the changes, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| were ones that brought the current rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| into compliance with the ordinances that I sponsored last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6511)|

| 1:48:41| and they look like they are quite in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| and are ready for the new board to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| and continue their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6527)|

| 1:48:57| Seeing none, motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6541)|

| 1:49:48| Commissioner Lee, would you like to say anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| I'll save that for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6598)|

| 1:50:02| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| This is on page 10, amendments to the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| This is ordinance number 0-22-12-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| an ordinance amending the Knox County Code Appendix A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Zoning Article III by adding section 3.100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| temporary uses, which includes use standards for temporary occupants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| and recreational vehicle, camper, or other non-permanent habitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6633)|

| 1:50:59| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| Mr. Snowden, this is the Charlie Bustler resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6668)|
| 1:51:17| which I think is a good resolution, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| Give us an update on this resolution because there's nothing attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| And then what we're doing in the future about entertainment venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| Yeah, be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| This ordinance does kind of create the framework for what we hope to be able to add on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| for additional uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Commissioner Daley and I spoke about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| some of these more unique venues that we're seeing in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| like music venues and things that really are kind of like special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| that we don't really have necessarily a good application permit for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| So we want to kind of frame this ordinance into, to Commissioner Daley's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| the Charlie Bustler ordinance that does allow folks that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| trying to build their current home and live in a camper at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| You know, there's some restrictions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| There has to be so much acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| They have to maintain an adequate and up-to-date building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| So they just can't move in the camper and stay there indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| But in addition to that, we're going to continue to add to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| things like music venues and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| that are starting to become prevalent in our area that really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| when our zoning ordinance was created, weren't necessarily, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| thought about at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| So this is the first step in what we hope will be an ordinance to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| all these things that you may hear from your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| Thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Director Snowden, can you give us some examples of non-permanent habitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| Say again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| In the description on this ordinance, you classify non-permanent habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| What does that include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| Non-permanent habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| I'd want to look at it in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| The particular section I'm not exactly sure about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| but I would think non-permanent is something that doesn't have a foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| such as, you know, maybe a mobile home or things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| because those things are permitted and allowed for under different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| So that would be my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| I want to look at it a little closer, but that would be what I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| Okay, because I think originally Commissioner Busler was talking about a recreational vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6820)|
| 1:53:47| or a camper or, I guess, a tent if somebody wanted to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| But if somebody moves in a mobile home, do you still consider that as a temporary structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6831)|
| 1:53:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| Those are permitted by the state, and they do have a review done by our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| primarily a zoning review because the structure itself is permitted through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| We would not consider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| We would verify the zoning was appropriate in regard to setbacks and lot intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| Okay, but my question is if somebody's intent, I believe, of the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| was to allow somebody building a home could have a temporary housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| whether it's a recreational vehicle or a camper there, to keep an eye on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| but my concern is when you say non-permanent, could somebody roll in a mobile home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| and then that mobile home not get removed once the house is constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| No, because the zoning ordinance codifies lot intensity in regard to the size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| so we can require that structure to be removed as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| because you're allowed two structures on two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| So there would be, if they don't meet that lot intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| we can require one of those structures to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| Well, I still don't think the intent was to allow like a mobile home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| to be delivered to the property while a home is being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| But I will check with the originator of this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| And I'll be happy to discuss it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| I mean, that's something that we want to make sure that we get that done right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| and not create any unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| So just let me know, and I'll be more than happy to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Mr. Snowden, last time we visited this, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| you were concerned that there were a whole lot of gray areas and loopholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| and ways that people could essentially skirt the system of codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| and do exactly the thing that we were trying to prevent even today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| Are you comfortable at this point, given the tightening it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| and the reworking of the language that your codes department can adequately enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| Because if there's even a sliver in that door, somebody will figure it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| and it will be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Yeah, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| I think we added five or six conditions or disclaimers on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| So my codes team and I sat down and worked with planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| and we came up with what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| because we've dealt with this issue for many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| in regard to what circumstances we've come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| So we believe we've codified all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| and think that this is a good ordinance in the sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| it does allow for people a little more flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| but it does have a window that does shut eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| Commissioner Daly, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| Jim, this came from South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| It's something that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| I believe so, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I think Steve Elliott did a good job, and also planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| They found a template from South Carolina, so we had that to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| Mr. Law Director, Jim and I had this discussion with Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7032)|
| 1:57:20| In our ordinance, if it does not say that you can, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| That's Dillon's rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| If it does not say that you can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| if it says I can let her own my property, I can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| If it doesn't, it's a dirty lot, and I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| So just keep in mind that when a constituent calls you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| if it doesn't say you can, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| That's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| Is there any more discussion regarding this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| The motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Madam Clerk, we are to the zoning portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7088)|
| 1:58:21| per the request of Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| Madam Chair, could just the two commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| and I'll be glad on mine, to just kind of give this just a quick rundown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| I think we start in District 9 first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| Yes, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| Mr. Pruitt has got four acres off of West Fort Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7118)|
| 1:58:43| and it is in the growth sector plan to go to two per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| and that's what he's requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| So there will be a sector plan vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| and then there will be a second vote on approval of the two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| and it fits in the surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| That's an acre and a half lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| You don't see acre and a half lots very much anymore on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| It's down to a quarter of an acre maybe or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| But that's just update on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| And then number 47 is actually in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| The individual has 16.1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| He's just basically taking one acre so he still remains in the green belt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| and then just subdividing the one acre to two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| and that's why it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| So I guess eighth is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| I don't have any specific information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| I've not spoken with Mr. Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| I know the property generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| Its leg lane is a dead-end road off Millertown Pike that essentially goes up a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7187)|
| 1:59:53| There's not very many people that live on it or near it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| It's a three-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I've not been contacted by anyone opposing this nor by Mr. Hutchins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| so I'll make a call to planning tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| and see what the specifics that he's trying to do are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| That's all I know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| The last one on mine is the Alcoa Highway mixed-use development area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| which we've been working on, it seemed like, for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| It has been approved through planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| and we've got to do something to Alcoa Highway there to get businesses to move in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7230)|
| 2:00:36| because as much as the traffic is flowing better, it's not business-friendly at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| So this is just a way to try to get a business-friendly atmosphere back to the Alcoa Highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7242)|
| 2:00:51| And I do have an announcement after we get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| Commissioner Beeler, with your permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| may I share what I know about your agenda items number 48 and 49?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Just letting everyone know, this is 3.06 acres from rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7266)|
| 2:01:14| There's difficulties with utility expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212?start=7274)|
