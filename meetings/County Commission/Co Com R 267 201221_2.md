| 4:35:23| In this order, if they are still with us, I appreciate everybody's patience, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16523)|
| 4:35:27| begin with Nicky Ziet, then Patty King, and then Phil King, Robert Thomas, and Sarah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16527)|
| 4:35:35| So, we will first go to Ms. Nicky Ziet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16535)|
| 4:35:38| Are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16538)|
| 4:35:40| If you would, please turn your camera and microphone on and make yourself known, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16540)|
| 4:35:46| Once I see you, I see your picture, I see you connecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16546)|
| 4:35:58| Ms. Zeit, let us know when you are connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16558)|
| 4:36:04| I seem to be having some Wi-Fi issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16564)|
| 4:36:07| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16567)|
| 4:36:08| Yep, I can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16568)|
| 4:36:09| Okay, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16569)|
| 4:36:11| and your county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16571)|
| 4:36:12| and you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16572)|
| 4:36:17| My name is Nikki Zeit and I live in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16577)|
| 4:36:21| I am a physician researcher here in Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16581)|
| 4:36:24| and I've lived here since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16584)|
| 4:36:28| The opinions I'm about to give you are mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16588)|
| 4:36:31| and not those of my employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16591)|
| 4:36:37| I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16597)|
| 4:36:40| and I know it's an opening for all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16600)|
| 4:36:42| so I will try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16602)|
| 4:36:44| As a physician researcher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16604)|
| 4:36:46| this pandemic has been very scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16606)|
| 4:36:48| Initially, Knoxville did very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16608)|
| 4:36:51| following the recommendations to socially distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16611)|
| 4:36:55| and use masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16615)|
| 4:36:56| And I think we also benefited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16616)|
| 4:36:57| from a very nicely timed spring break and good weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16617)|
| 4:37:02| during the beginning of this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16622)|
| 4:37:05| When I spoke with colleagues of mine in New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16625)|
| 4:37:08| Chicago, Detroit, it was scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16628)|
| 4:37:12| And what we were hearing from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16632)|
| 4:37:13| was that their hospitals were full, people were dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16633)|
| 4:37:18| We are now at that place in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16638)|
| 4:37:21| And although earlier you had people come on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16641)|
| 4:37:24| and say that our hospitals are not a capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16644)|
| 4:37:27| that is simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16647)|
| 4:37:29| And if we don't make changes before the Christmas holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16649)|
| 4:37:32| it will absolutely be at the brink of disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16652)|
| 4:37:38| I also would like to disagree with the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16658)|
| 4:37:41| on restaurants not being a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16661)|
| 4:37:45| for spread of this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16665)|
| 4:37:48| We know that people unmasking and eating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16668)|
| 4:37:51| is a frequent cause of transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16671)|
| 4:37:54| And while I support local restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16674)|
| 4:37:57| I recommend that we do our best to continue to do takeout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16677)|
| 4:38:01| and support restaurants while distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16681)|
| 4:38:03| I also would like to comment on the great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16683)|
| 4:38:06| that was mentioned earlier from the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16686)|
| 4:38:09| We did do amazing work in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16689)|
| 4:38:11| but we did amazing work getting so many people to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16691)|
| 4:38:14| because people wore masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16694)|
| 4:38:16| and there were limited numbers of people allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16696)|
| 4:38:18| in the voting polling places at a given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16698)|
| 4:38:24| This is what we need to do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16704)|
| 4:38:27| in order to continue to do our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16707)|
| 4:38:30| to in order to control this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16710)|
| 4:38:36| We need to distance and continue to wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16716)|
| 4:38:39| and we need to allow the board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16719)|
| 4:38:42| who are experts in the medical field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16722)|
| 4:38:45| to make these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16725)|
| 4:38:48| While they are not elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16728)|
| 4:38:50| they are experts in their field and they are not arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16730)|
| 4:38:54| They have these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16734)|
| 4:38:55| because they have been appointed to these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16735)|
| 4:38:58| and we should continue to follow their recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16738)|
| 4:39:02| and allow them to make very evidence-based decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16742)|
| 4:39:07| that will help us get through this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16747)|
| 4:39:10| while we wait for the vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16750)|
| 4:39:12| Again, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16752)|
| 4:39:15| I know it's been a long night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16755)|
| 4:39:16| but please support the board of health, Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16756)|

| 4:39:45| Tonight, I'm coming to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16785)|
| 4:39:46| to talk to you about the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16786)|
| 4:39:49| to the school board to cancel indoor sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16789)|
| 4:39:52| that the board of health made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16792)|
| 4:39:54| We are all aware that we shut down schools on March 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16794)|
| 4:39:58| and never returned for the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16798)|
| 4:40:00| which meant the sports and all other activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16800)|
| 4:40:02| did not get the exposure for the scholarships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16802)|
| 4:40:05| Now the BOH is recommending to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16805)|
| 4:40:09| to shut down all sports and other indoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16809)|
| 4:40:13| This means again, that the students cannot get the exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16813)|
| 4:40:17| that they need to get a scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16817)|
| 4:40:20| As an educator, this makes me angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16820)|
| 4:40:22| because for some students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16822)|
| 4:40:24| this is the only way they get to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16824)|
| 4:40:27| We need to stop this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16827)|
| 4:40:29| Also, as you recall, the BOH sent a request to the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16829)|
| 4:40:34| to give them the power and authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16834)|
| 4:40:37| over surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16837)|
| 4:40:38| causing a negative impact in relations with other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16838)|
| 4:40:44| They're also sent a letter to the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16844)|
| 4:40:46| asking for the statewide mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16846)|
| 4:40:49| They're also reaching out to other BOHs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16849)|
| 4:40:52| asking them to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16852)|
| 4:40:54| We need to dissolve this board of their power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16854)|
| 4:40:57| and make them an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16857)|
| 4:40:59| Otherwise, they will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16859)|
| 4:41:01| to try to overreach their power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16861)|
| 4:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16863)|
| 4:41:03| Larson, I'd like to give the rest of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16863)|
| 4:41:05| to my husband, Phil, he's right after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16865)|
| 4:41:08| Okay, thank you, Ms. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16868)|
| 4:41:11| Mr. King, if you would please state your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16871)|
| 4:41:13| your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16873)|
| 4:41:14| we'll reset the clock for you at three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16874)|
| 4:41:18| Phil King, Knox County, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16878)|
| 4:41:23| Commissioners, thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16883)|
| 4:41:25| On June 17th, BOH met for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16885)|
| 4:41:28| as not just a policymaking body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16888)|
| 4:41:30| but as the only policymaking body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16890)|
| 4:41:32| for public health and safety in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16892)|
| 4:41:35| Dr. Buchanan made this statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16895)|
| 4:41:37| this was a change from the historical precedence for the BOH,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16897)|
| 4:41:41| which had always acted as an advisory role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16901)|
| 4:41:44| and not as a policymaking body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16904)|
| 4:41:46| And honestly, the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16906)|
| 4:41:48| has not been a policymaking body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16908)|
| 4:41:53| During both that meeting and the second meeting on July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16913)|
| 4:41:56| Deputy Law Director Myers Morton advised many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16916)|
| 4:41:59| and very adamantly that the BOH could do anything they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16919)|
| 4:42:03| but they better not exceed the governor's direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16923)|
| 4:42:06| or the county would lose its immunity to the lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16926)|
| 4:42:12| He also very passionately warned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16932)|
| 4:42:17| that the first order on July 1st mandating masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16937)|
| 4:42:19| was not only unconstitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16939)|
| 4:42:21| but would also bankrupt the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16941)|
| 4:42:23| He was completely ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16943)|
| 4:42:25| This was just the beginning of egregious overreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16945)|
| 4:42:27| by an unelected body with no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16947)|
| 4:42:30| In the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16950)|
| 4:42:31| the actions by the BOH has resulted in devastation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16951)|
| 4:42:36| to the economy, specifically small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16956)|
| 4:42:39| of which many are gone for good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| The breakdown of community stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16961)|
| 4:42:43| loss of jobs by thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16963)|
| 4:42:44| a record-breaking spike in mental instability and suicide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16964)|
| 4:42:47| our county thrown into legal and financial jeopardy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16967)|
| 4:42:50| and now thanks to the request sent to the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16970)|
| 4:42:52| to extend their powers to neighboring counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16972)|
| 4:42:55| resulting in a great negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16975)|
| 4:42:58| on inter-county relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16978)|
| 4:43:00| All of this was achieved by an untouchable board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16980)|
| 4:43:03| with unfettered powers against the advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16983)|
| 4:43:05| of the county law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16985)|
| 4:43:07| business owners, private citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16987)|
| 4:43:09| for all their intentions and all their orders and mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16989)|
| 4:43:12| That has negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16992)|
| 4:43:15| on so many sectors of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16995)|
| 4:43:19| None of it resulted in mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16999)|
| 4:43:21| or even a flattening of the COVID curve in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17001)|
| 4:43:24| The numbers continue to climb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17004)|
| 4:43:26| despite a recent Carnegie Mellon report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17006)|
| 4:43:29| showing that 92% of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17009)|
| 4:43:31| are following the mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17011)|
| 4:43:33| The fact is, while some have tried to convolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17013)|
| 4:43:36| and confuse both the actions of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17016)|
| 4:43:38| and the legality of dissolving it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17018)|
| 4:43:40| this is not about wearing or not wearing the mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17020)|
| 4:43:43| or being anti-mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17023)|
| 4:43:44| which it was never about a personal or political motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17024)|
| 4:43:48| This is about the forced compliance of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17028)|
| 4:43:51| against their freedoms, your freedoms, as well as mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17031)|
| 4:43:54| based on a very narrow mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17034)|
| 4:43:56| with absolutely no accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17036)|
| 4:43:58| and contrary to erroneous notions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17038)|
| 4:44:00| no checks and balances required by our constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17040)|
| 4:44:05| as a representative government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17045)|
| 4:44:06| Ladies and gentlemen, this is really very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17046)|
| 4:44:09| You took an oath as members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17049)|
| 4:44:10| of this county's legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17050)|
| 4:44:13| The oath is not predicated upon general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17053)|
| 4:44:16| or personal principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17056)|
| 4:44:17| whether or not a decision will cause community division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17057)|
| 4:44:20| or little angels and demons on your shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17060)|
| 4:44:23| Your oath was to defend our rights, freedoms, and liberties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17063)|
| 4:44:26| under the U.S. and Tennessee constitutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17066)|
| 4:44:28| For six months, our constitutional freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17068)|
| 4:44:30| have been abridged by an unelected board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17070)|
| 4:44:33| that swore no oaths, has for all good intents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17073)|
| 4:44:36| wreaked havoc on our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17076)|
| 4:44:37| and as Commissioner Daley has expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17077)|
| 4:44:40| has made criminals Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17080)|
| 4:44:43| who dare to exercise their God-given freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17083)|
| 4:44:46| Your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17086)|
| 4:44:47| If you could have a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17087)|
| 4:44:48| It's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17088)|
| 4:44:49| Do the right thing, the constitutional thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17089)|
| 4:44:51| Fulfill your oath and vote for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17091)|
| 4:44:57| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17097)|
| 4:44:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17099)|
| 4:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17099)|
| 4:45:01| Mr. Robert Thomas, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17101)|
| 4:45:03| I want to remind all of our speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17103)|
| 4:45:04| to please watch the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17104)|
| 4:45:07| I have respect for the other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17107)|
| 4:45:08| Mr. Robert Thomas, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17108)|
| 4:45:12| Please state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17112)|
| 4:45:15| My name is Robert Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17115)|
| 4:45:17| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17117)|
| 4:45:18| I'd like to thank the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17118)|
| 4:45:19| for making this public forum available to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17119)|
| 4:45:22| This is, after all, their forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17122)|
| 4:45:24| and they have seated these commissioners in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17124)|
| 4:45:26| so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17126)|
| 4:45:27| Commissioner Biggs, thank you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17127)|
| 4:45:29| for your support of the resolution last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17129)|
| 4:45:31| As I promised, sir, there's a spot in my yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17131)|
| 4:45:33| for any re-election signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17133)|
| 4:45:34| that you might want to put up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17134)|
| 4:45:36| Commissioner Beeler, the same goes for you as well, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17136)|
| 4:45:39| And Commissioner Ward, you let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17139)|
| 4:45:40| when I need to come over and answer phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17140)|
| 4:45:42| or go door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17142)|
| 4:45:43| I appreciate your efforts to uphold the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17143)|
| 4:45:46| and seek the defense thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17146)|
| 4:45:49| Commissioners Hill, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17149)|
| 4:45:51| Commissioner Smith, Commissioners Daley and Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17151)|
| 4:45:54| thank you as well for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17154)|
| 4:45:56| of the resolution last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17156)|
| 4:45:58| I want to uplift and encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17158)|
| 4:46:00| to continue to do so this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17160)|
| 4:46:03| Commissioners Lundy and Durant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17163)|
| 4:46:05| I want to thank you for voting your conscience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17165)|
| 4:46:06| even though at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17166)|
| 4:46:07| we disagree on the best way to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17167)|
| 4:46:11| I do appreciate the fact that you are in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17171)|
| 4:46:13| that is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17173)|
| 4:46:16| So I at least appreciate you voting your consciences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17176)|
| 4:46:19| even though I disagree with the outcome there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17179)|
| 4:46:21| Now, you all had to listen to a lot of ones and zeros| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17181)|
| 4:46:23| and numbers during the Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17183)|
| 4:46:24| I'm going to ask you to listen to two more numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17184)|
| 4:46:26| very quickly this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17186)|
| 4:46:27| And if you would humor me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17187)|
| 4:46:28| if you have a paper and pencil or pen in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17188)|
| 4:46:31| I would encourage you to write them down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17191)|
| 4:46:32| The first number is 266, 266.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17192)|
| 4:46:39| As best I know, that is the current death count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17199)|
| 4:46:42| inside Knox County for people who have died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17202)|
| 4:46:45| in some manner that was somehow related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17205)|
| 4:46:51| Here's the next number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17211)|
| 4:46:54| 1,354,664.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17214)|
| 4:46:59| Let me repeat that number for you one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17219)|
| 4:47:00| 1,354,664.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17220)|
| 4:47:06| That is the number of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17226)|
| 4:47:12| who have given their lives to protect and defend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17232)|
| 4:47:16| the Constitution of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17236)|
| 4:47:19| against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17239)|
| 4:47:23| Now, as we have discussed over the past several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17243)|
| 4:47:26| the Board of Health, there's been a lot of talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17246)|
| 4:47:28| about keeping people safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17248)|
| 4:47:31| There's not been a whole lot of talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17251)|
| 4:47:32| about defending the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17252)|
| 4:47:37| I would propose to you that 1,354,664,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17257)|
| 4:47:46| that number represents a whole lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17266)|
| 4:47:50| who wish the conversation was more focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17270)|
| 4:47:52| on the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17272)|
| 4:47:54| Please continue your support for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17274)|
| 4:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17279)|
| 4:48:01| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17281)|
| 4:48:04| Next up is Sarah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17284)|
| 4:48:07| Sarah, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17287)|
| 4:48:09| Sarah Thomas will not be here this evening, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17289)|
| 4:48:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17292)|
| 4:48:14| Next up in this order, I'm going to call them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17294)|
| 4:48:16| just to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17296)|
| 4:48:17| Eric Wader, Lillian Mashburn, Lisa Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17297)|
| 4:48:20| Gary Comer, and Lucille Griffo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17300)|
| 4:48:24| We'll go next to Eric Wader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17304)|
| 4:48:26| Mr. Wader, if you would, please turn your camera and mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17306)|
| 4:48:29| And if you would, state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17309)|
| 4:48:31| and your county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17311)|
| 4:48:33| You have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17313)|
| 4:48:35| My name is Eric Wader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17315)|
| 4:48:36| I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17316)|
| 4:48:39| I'm speaking today on a different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17319)|
| 4:48:41| It's the Sports Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17321)|
| 4:48:43| which you guys are voting on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17323)|
| 4:48:46| You know, I'm looking at this debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17326)|
| 4:48:48| on the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17328)|
| 4:48:50| and I'm wondering how this debate would have gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17330)|
| 4:48:54| if the County Commission and the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17334)|
| 4:48:57| both had a say on the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17337)|
| 4:49:01| The Board of Health, I think everyone would agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17341)|
| 4:49:04| regardless of your position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17344)|
| 4:49:06| that it has a lot of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17346)|
| 4:49:11| But right now, the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17351)|
| 4:49:14| is the sole body that has a say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17354)|
| 4:49:16| But tonight, you guys are going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17356)|
| 4:49:18| to create a Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17358)|
| 4:49:21| Now, if you have read the Chapter 67| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17361)|
| 4:49:26| of the Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17366)|
| 4:49:27| Sports Authorities have a lot of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17367)|
| 4:49:32| But the only difference now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17372)|
| 4:49:34| if you want to make changes to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17374)|
| 4:49:37| you need the City Council to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17377)|
| 4:49:40| Sitting in the county has philosophical differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17380)|
| 4:49:43| political differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17383)|
| 4:49:45| and, you know, that's something to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17385)|
| 4:49:49| with what you're creating now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17389)|
| 4:49:51| If you guys get in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17391)|
| 4:49:53| where you want to make an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17393)|
| 4:49:55| they also have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17395)|
| 4:49:57| Also, what about if just one of the bodies want to dissolve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17397)|
| 4:50:02| How does that look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17402)|
| 4:50:03| There is language in there about dissolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17403)|
| 4:50:06| but it doesn't say anything about unilaterally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17406)|
| 4:50:10| As far as the Sports Authority goes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17410)|
| 4:50:13| who's going to be appointed to this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17413)|
| 4:50:15| Is it going to be taxpayer watchdogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17415)|
| 4:50:17| or is it going to be yes people for the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17417)|
| 4:50:20| If it's yes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17420)|
| 4:50:22| we're likely going to see more instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17422)|
| 4:50:24| of waste and cronyism with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17424)|
| 4:50:28| You do not need to create a Sports Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17428)|
| 4:50:30| to discuss the financial terms of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17430)|
| 4:50:40| I would give you Jackson, Tennessee has no Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17440)|
| 4:50:44| Also, if you look at Memphis and Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17444)|
| 4:50:48| they have a system where they use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17448)|
| 4:50:50| a public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17450)|
| 4:50:52| in conjunction with the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17452)|
| 4:50:55| And I think that can also allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17455)|
| 4:50:56| for more accountability to taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17456)|
| 4:50:59| For instance, the Sports Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17459)|
| 4:51:01| is the language under the charter would hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17461)|
| 4:51:05| If there's differences over employee conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17465)|
| 4:51:10| and the City Council maybe wants to keep those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17470)|
| 4:51:13| and the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17473)|
| 4:51:15| wants to discipline those employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17475)|
| 4:51:17| how would that be handled under this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17477)|
| 4:51:21| But I think more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17481)|
| 4:51:22| since my time is almost up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17482)|
| 4:51:24| I think this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17484)|
| 4:51:26| whether you're talking about the Sports Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17486)|
| 4:51:29| or possibly as soon as you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17489)|
| 4:51:31| are going to vote on funding for it, it's being rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17491)|
| 4:51:34| And if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17494)|
| 4:51:35| there was an article published by the Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17495)|
| 4:51:38| It talked about the Nashville Sound Stadium rush timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17498)|
| 4:51:41| blamed for the busted budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17501)|
| 4:51:44| And one of the lines goes that there was a $21 million more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17504)|
| 4:51:49| in related work, not part of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17509)|
| 4:51:52| So I think overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17512)|
| 4:51:54| I just, the smartest thing the Commission can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17514)|
| 4:51:57| the fiscally responsible thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17517)|
| 4:51:59| the limited government thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17519)|
| 4:52:01| would be hold off on creating the Sports Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17521)|
| 4:52:04| and give this some more investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17524)|
| 4:52:07| before you find yourself in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17527)|
| 4:52:10| just like we're currently in with the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17530)|
| 4:52:13| Thank you, Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17533)|
| 4:52:14| And to Kyle Ward's question while I was talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17534)|
| 4:52:17| I did paint all those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17537)|
| 4:52:19| So that's my beginning artwork there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17539)|
| 4:52:23| Thank you, Mr. Wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17543)|
| 4:52:24| I apologize for the name mix up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17544)|
| 4:52:27| No, no, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17547)|
| 4:52:28| That's something I've dealt with all my life, so you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17548)|
| 4:52:31| Have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17551)|
| 4:52:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17552)|
| 4:52:34| Next up is Lillian Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17554)|
| 4:52:35| Lillian, if you would please turn your microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17555)|
| 4:52:38| and camera on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17558)|
| 4:52:39| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17559)|
| 4:52:41| Please state your name and your county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17561)|
| 4:52:44| and you have three minutes to address Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17564)|
| 4:52:46| I haven't come up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17566)|
| 4:52:49| You are on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17569)|
| 4:52:51| Okay, I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17571)|
| 4:52:52| Give us a name and what county you live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17572)|
| 4:52:54| and then you've got three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17574)|
| 4:52:55| Okay, I'm Lillian Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17575)|
| 4:52:58| I'm a lifelong resident of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17578)|
| 4:53:00| soon to be 78 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17580)|
| 4:53:03| I'm here to talk briefly about the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17583)|
| 4:53:06| I know, not Sports Authority, the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17586)|
| 4:53:12| I really am really convinced that we need to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17592)|
| 4:53:17| the Board of Health during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17597)|
| 4:53:21| As an elderly person who is with lung issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17601)|
| 4:53:25| I can't be out anywhere where there's a likelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17605)|
| 4:53:30| of my getting sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17610)|
| 4:53:32| We have not been to restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17612)|
| 4:53:34| We have not been in any stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17614)|
| 4:53:36| except during very early senior hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17616)|
| 4:53:40| Fortunately, most of the stores that we go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17620)|
| 4:53:44| and only those, people are very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17624)|
| 4:53:48| about wearing their mask and with distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17628)|
| 4:53:52| That's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17632)|
| 4:53:54| I think you need to remember that there's a lot of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17634)|
| 4:53:57| in this county whose lives are in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17637)|
| 4:54:00| And while you all have been meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17640)|
| 4:54:02| I got a news feed that the White House has designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17642)|
| 4:54:06| Knoxville as with the highest level of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17646)|
| 4:54:10| in the country of population density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17650)|
| 4:54:13| So I think that's something we need to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17653)|
| 4:54:17| I see restaurants who shouldn't be chock full, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17657)|
| 4:54:23| But we go out, we get food, take out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17663)|
| 4:54:28| That's all we've done for the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17668)|
| 4:54:30| We haven't been able to be with our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17670)|
| 4:54:32| for Thanksgiving, our grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17672)|
| 4:54:34| and we'll not be able to be for Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17674)|
| 4:54:37| Think about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17677)|
| 4:54:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17679)|
| 4:54:41| Thank you, Ms. Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17681)|
| 4:54:43| Next speaker is Lisa Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17683)|
| 4:54:45| Lisa, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17685)|
| 4:54:48| Lisa Taylor, I see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17688)|
| 4:54:49| If you would turn your, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17689)|
| 4:54:51| If you would please give us your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17691)|
| 4:54:53| and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17693)|
| 4:54:54| you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17694)|
| 4:54:56| Thank you, my name is Lisa Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17696)|
| 4:54:58| and I live in Knox County 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17698)|
| 4:55:01| I wanna thank you commissioners for lighting a fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17701)|
| 4:55:03| and opening the eyes of many Knox Countians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17703)|
| 4:55:06| I for one have lived in this county for more than 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17706)|
| 4:55:09| and ashamedly, I could not name one commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17709)|
| 4:55:12| until six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17712)|
| 4:55:13| I am not a restaurateur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17713)|
| 4:55:15| nor do I operate a brick and mortar business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17715)|
| 4:55:18| but I'm the parent of two Knox County high school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17718)|
| 4:55:20| and I'm standing up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17720)|
| 4:55:22| When school abruptly ended in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17722)|
| 4:55:24| all of my children's extracurricular activities ended as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17724)|
| 4:55:27| When the Knox County schools reopening plan was announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17727)|
| 4:55:30| we understood that things would be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17730)|
| 4:55:32| but my children were thankful for the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17732)|
| 4:55:34| to return to their school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17734)|
| 4:55:36| To date, we have endured contact tracing and quarantining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17736)|
| 4:55:40| in their school going red, not once but twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17740)|
| 4:55:43| but we have held onto the hope of better things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17743)|
| 4:55:45| to come next semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17745)|
| 4:55:46| However, on December 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17746)|
| 4:55:48| during the Knox County Board of Health meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17748)|
| 4:55:50| Dr. Buchanan presented a draft of resolution 2020-C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17750)|
| 4:55:54| entitled the Knox County Safer at Home and Business Guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17754)|
| 4:55:58| item number three on this draft read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17758)|
| 4:56:00| to reduce the opportunity for the spread of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17760)|
| 4:56:03| the Knox County Board of Education is encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17763)|
| 4:56:05| to not allow extracurricular activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17765)|
| 4:56:08| for the spring of 2021 school session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17768)|
| 4:56:11| I was shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17771)|
| 4:56:12| The very next day, WBIR Channel 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17772)|
| 4:56:15| published a story entitled Children's Mental Health Needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17775)|
| 4:56:18| Reaching Disastrous Proportions During Pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17778)|
| 4:56:21| Katie Inman interviewed Dr. Joe Childs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17781)|
| 4:56:24| the chief medical officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17784)|
| 4:56:25| at East Tennessee Children's Hospital right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17785)|
| 4:56:28| In short, Dr. Childs said that while most kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17788)|
| 4:56:31| have been able to handle the physical symptoms of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17791)|
| 4:56:34| the isolation and emotional toll can lead to depression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17794)|
| 4:56:37| and suicide and drug and substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17797)|
| 4:56:40| He stated there are a lot of behavioral health concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17800)|
| 4:56:43| and our ER is definitely seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17803)|
| 4:56:46| So let's put this into perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17806)|
| 4:56:47| We have disastrous mental health and behavioral issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17807)|
| 4:56:50| in our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17810)|
| 4:56:51| We have vaccines on the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17811)|
| 4:56:53| that will reportedly offer protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17813)|
| 4:56:55| and will reduce virus transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17815)|
| 4:56:57| And the Knox County Health Department data even today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17817)|
| 4:56:59| shows that there has been a hospitalization rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17819)|
| 4:57:02| of less than half of 1% and a 0% death rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17822)|
| 4:57:06| in the zero to 17 age bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17826)|
| 4:57:08| Yet, we should eliminate extracurricular activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17828)|
| 4:57:11| in our school system for spring 2021?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17831)|
| 4:57:14| Have we forgotten that our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17834)|
| 4:57:16| already went through this in spring 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17836)|
| 4:57:19| Let me be clear, this is not just about sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17839)|
| 4:57:21| My children are not athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17841)|
| 4:57:23| However, they are among the thousands of fine arts students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17843)|
| 4:57:25| who have had the band, dance, choirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17845)|
| 4:57:27| and theater performances taken away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17847)|
| 4:57:30| Where's this logic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17850)|
| 4:57:31| This appears to be another way for the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17851)|
| 4:57:33| to usurp arbitrary power over the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17853)|
| 4:57:37| It has become clear as mandates and resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17857)|
| 4:57:39| have been handed down or amended by this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17859)|
| 4:57:41| month after month, that this board has the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17861)|
| 4:57:43| to do literally anything under the guise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17863)|
| 4:57:45| of public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17865)|
| 4:57:47| On October 1st, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17867)|
| 4:57:48| I was sworn in as a naturalized US citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17868)|
| 4:57:51| And tonight, I am thankful for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17871)|
| 4:57:54| to participate in my democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17874)|
| 4:57:56| by publicly supporting Commissioner Ward's ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17876)|
| 4:57:58| to shift the Knox County Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17878)|
| 4:58:00| to an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17880)|
| 4:58:01| And I thank you in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17881)|
| 4:58:02| for supporting this ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17882)|
| 4:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17884)|
| 4:58:05| Thank you, Ms. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17885)|
| 4:58:10| Next speaker is Gary Comer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17890)|
| 4:58:12| Gary, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17892)|
| 4:58:15| Yes, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17895)|
| 4:58:15| If you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17895)|
| 4:58:17| and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17897)|
| 4:58:19| You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17899)|
| 4:58:22| Sure, my name is Gary Comer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17902)|
| 4:58:24| I'm a lifelong Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17904)|
| 4:58:27| I'm addressing county commission today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17907)|
| 4:58:28| because I feel as though the present dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17908)|
| 4:58:30| regarding mask mandates and the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17910)|
| 4:58:33| has been unfortunately very one-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17913)|
| 4:58:35| And it would seem that a minority of extremists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17915)|
| 4:58:38| has hijacked conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17918)|
| 4:58:40| So I wish to speak for what I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17920)|
| 4:58:41| are a silent majority of Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17921)|
| 4:58:43| who are frustrated by clear lack of leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17923)|
| 4:58:46| at the federal, state and local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17926)|
| 4:58:48| We're all entitled to our own opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17928)|
| 4:58:50| but we're not entitled to our own effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17930)|
| 4:58:52| And the facts are sobering to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17932)|
| 4:58:54| Tennessee is now the national hotspot for COVID infections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17934)|
| 4:58:57| Our hospital system has been strained to its breaking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17937)|
| 4:59:00| 263 Knox County residents have lost their lives to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17940)|
| 4:59:03| 26 of them since last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17943)|
| 4:59:05| We see these numbers every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17945)|
| 4:59:07| but here's a number we don't see daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17947)|
| 4:59:08| 181 public health officials in 38 states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17948)|
| 4:59:12| have resigned, retired or been fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17952)|
| 4:59:14| since April the 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17954)|
| 4:59:16| This is a result of a sustained campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17956)|
| 4:59:18| against science, facts and common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17958)|
| 4:59:20| by a vocal minority that has successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17960)|
| 4:59:23| used bullying tactics to browbeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17963)|
| 4:59:25| various local and state governments into submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17965)|
| 4:59:28| And this is precisely what the ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17968)|
| 4:59:30| proposed by Commissioner Ward would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17970)|
| 4:59:32| It was once said that demanding one's rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17972)|
| 4:59:34| without accepting one's responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17974)|
| 4:59:36| isn't freedom, it's adolescence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17976)|
| 4:59:38| Teenagers, of course, think they know everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17978)|
| 4:59:40| until they become adults and realize they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17980)|
| 4:59:43| I know nothing of the business of garbage collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17983)|
| 4:59:46| I would never tell Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17986)|
| 4:59:47| how to run his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17987)|
| 4:59:49| My understanding is that Mr. Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17989)|
| 4:59:50| is not a medical professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17990)|
| 4:59:51| so I fail to understand why he feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17991)|
| 4:59:54| he has the authority to undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17994)|
| 4:59:55| actual medical professionals, our County Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17995)|
| 4:59:58| who are doing their jobs on a voluntary, unpaid basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=17998)|
| 5:00:01| and have borne the brunt of immense criticism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18001)|
| 5:00:03| during a very trying time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18003)|
| 5:00:06| Commissioner Ward and his radical cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18006)|
| 5:00:07| tell you that masks don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18007)|
| 5:00:09| that our health board are unelected bureaucrats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18009)|
| 5:00:12| that COVID is a hoax, that the mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18012)|
| 5:00:14| is governmental overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18014)|
| 5:00:15| But here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18015)|
| 5:00:18| They're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18018)|
| 5:00:19| You know they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18019)|
| 5:00:19| Science knows they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18019)|
| 5:00:21| Medical professionals know they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18021)|
| 5:00:23| And perhaps most importantly, they know they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18023)|
| 5:00:26| But instead of admitting they're wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18026)|
| 5:00:27| they double down on the same falsehoods time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18027)|
| 5:00:31| The truth is masks work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18031)|
| 5:00:32| States and counties with mask mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18032)|
| 5:00:34| have a lower rate of infection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18034)|
| 5:00:35| than states and counties that do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18035)|
| 5:00:38| So I'm here this evening to call upon County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18038)|
| 5:00:40| to take a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18040)|
| 5:00:41| We need six courageous commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18041)|
| 5:00:43| to vote no on Ward's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18043)|
| 5:00:45| and draw a line in the sand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18045)|
| 5:00:47| against this foolish, irresponsible madness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18047)|
| 5:00:49| that we've allowed to invade our national,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18049)|
| 5:00:51| state, and local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18051)|
| 5:00:53| Don't let the bullies win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18053)|
| 5:00:54| Lives are at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18054)|
| 5:00:55| Do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18055)|
| 5:00:56| Thank you for your time and your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18056)|
| 5:00:59| Thank you, Mr. Comer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18059)|

| 5:01:09| I do not see anybody by that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18069)|
| 5:01:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18072)|
| 5:01:15| Lucille Griffo, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18075)|
| 5:01:19| Okay, I do not see that person with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18079)|
| 5:01:22| Linda Fitzpatrick, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18082)|
| 5:01:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18085)|

| 5:01:43| and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18103)|
| 5:01:45| You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18105)|
| 5:01:47| Thank you, sir, and thank you to all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18107)|
| 5:01:49| who work on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18109)|

| 5:01:52| I am at 37912 zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18112)|
| 5:01:56| I'm speaking on behalf of asking you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18116)|
| 5:01:59| to have the Board of Health sustain their authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18119)|
| 5:02:04| during this time of terrible health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18124)|
| 5:02:08| We have a, earlier tonight we've heard people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18128)|
| 5:02:13| talk about the emergency services people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18133)|
| 5:02:16| across Knox County who get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18136)|
| 5:02:19| with their special skills and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18139)|
| 5:02:22| how to manage the emergency services for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18142)|
| 5:02:27| They are not amateurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18147)|
| 5:02:29| They are skilled professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18149)|
| 5:02:31| many of whom, as we saw earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18151)|
| 5:02:34| have been at it here in our county for many, many decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18154)|
| 5:02:38| Our Board of Health includes PharmD people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18158)|
| 5:02:42| includes people who are MDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18162)|
| 5:02:45| They are consulting with epidemiologists and virologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18165)|
| 5:02:49| not only locally, but around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18169)|
| 5:02:52| As we have emerging information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18172)|
| 5:02:55| we need to have skilled people who are going to navigate us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18175)|
| 5:03:00| through what I believe will be a very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18180)|
| 5:03:03| first quarter, and I'll make four points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18183)|
| 5:03:06| Today it's been reported that we have 70%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18186)|
| 5:03:12| of the airline flying population that we had last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18192)|
| 5:03:17| 30% fewer, but that's an awful lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18197)|
| 5:03:21| who are traveling on airplanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18201)|
| 5:03:23| They're coming back with transmissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18203)|
| 5:03:26| We have hospitals that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18206)|
| 5:03:28| strained to capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18208)|
| 5:03:31| We heard earlier a man say no one's been turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18211)|
| 5:03:37| I say no one's been turned away yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18217)|
| 5:03:38| but we can be sure that people will be turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18218)|
| 5:03:42| We are going to have a terrible surge in the first quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18222)|
| 5:03:46| We need people who are making triage decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18226)|
| 5:03:50| who know what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18230)|
| 5:03:52| We don't need amateurs right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18232)|
| 5:03:54| during this public health emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18234)|
| 5:03:57| We also have authorities from around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18237)|
| 5:04:02| who are collaborating as information becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18242)|
| 5:04:06| London is under a lockdown right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18246)|
| 5:04:10| because there is a new strain of virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18250)|
| 5:04:13| that is considerably more contagious than classic COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18253)|
| 5:04:18| We don't know the lethality yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18258)|
| 5:04:21| We will know in four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18261)|
| 5:04:23| How will we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18263)|
| 5:04:25| We will know because skilled people will inform us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18265)|
| 5:04:29| not only from America, but from cities around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18269)|
| 5:04:32| who are learning together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18272)|
| 5:04:34| Just like our emergency services folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18274)|
| 5:04:36| we need folks who know what they're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18276)|
| 5:04:40| to learn what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18280)|
| 5:04:42| The final point is vaccines are going to become available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18282)|
| 5:04:46| but that's no picnic because it's a two-dose regimen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18286)|
| 5:04:50| getting people to be compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18290)|
| 5:04:53| getting community education out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18293)|
| 5:04:56| has to be guided by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18296)|
| 5:04:58| who know what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18298)|
| 5:05:01| Please commissioners vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18301)|
| 5:05:04| of sustaining the Board of Health Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18304)|
| 5:05:07| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18307)|
| 5:05:09| Thank you, Ms. Fitzpatrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18309)|
| 5:05:11| Our next speaker is Emily Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18311)|
| 5:05:13| Emily Roberts, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18313)|
| 5:05:15| If you would, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18315)|
| 5:05:16| If you would please turn your microphone and your camera on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18316)|
| 5:05:20| and if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18320)|
| 5:05:23| and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18323)|
| 5:05:25| You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18325)|
| 5:05:28| Hi, good evening and Merry Christmas, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18328)|
| 5:05:31| My name is Emily Roberts and I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18331)|
| 5:05:34| In my 20s, I had the great privilege of working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18334)|
| 5:05:37| for some incredible leaders in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18337)|
| 5:05:39| including a Tennessee senator and some former DOJ officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18339)|
| 5:05:43| They taught me that the best leaders are unifiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18343)|
| 5:05:45| and above all, problem solvers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18345)|
| 5:05:48| You have a hard job and I imagine that you did not imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18348)|
| 5:05:51| this when you signed up to be commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18351)|
| 5:05:54| My conundrum has been watching proceedings here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18354)|
| 5:05:56| through the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18356)|
| 5:05:58| I've seen denial, fear, anger and divisiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18358)|
| 5:06:02| and blame in our leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18362)|
| 5:06:04| And that is scarier than COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18364)|
| 5:06:06| because it means we cannot fix problems together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18366)|
| 5:06:09| especially not in a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18369)|
| 5:06:11| Your proposal to remove the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18371)|
| 5:06:13| from its functioning is to me at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18373)|
| 5:06:16| like deciding to renovate the sprinkler system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18376)|
| 5:06:18| in a burning building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18378)|
| 5:06:20| If you're gonna try and retool the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18380)|
| 5:06:23| do it at a time when people's lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18383)|
| 5:06:24| are not on the line daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18384)|
| 5:06:26| do it at a time when our healthcare system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18386)|
| 5:06:28| is not about to break under the weight of an illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18388)|
| 5:06:30| that we could have mitigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18390)|
| 5:06:32| Instead, let's create economic advisory boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18392)|
| 5:06:35| small business working groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18395)|
| 5:06:37| mental health crisis units, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18397)|
| 5:06:39| Just something constructive rather than destructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18399)|
| 5:06:43| We can pretend that the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18403)|
| 5:06:44| is out to ruin our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18404)|
| 5:06:46| or we can realize in a pandemic, life is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18406)|
| 5:06:50| We have to stop using divisive language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18410)|
| 5:06:52| saying things like our Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18412)|
| 5:06:55| has made Knox County citizens into criminals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18415)|
| 5:06:58| which is every bit as inflammatory and incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18418)|
| 5:07:01| as if I were to call people who don't wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18421)|
| 5:07:03| or don't socially distance murderers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18423)|
| 5:07:06| We need our political and medical leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18426)|
| 5:07:08| to be partners both on and off camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18428)|
| 5:07:11| And we need you to see all of your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18431)|
| 5:07:15| This is the last thing I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18435)|
| 5:07:17| My son's favorite movie is Cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18437)|
| 5:07:19| And just in case you haven't watched Disney in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18439)|
| 5:07:22| the climax plays out like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18442)|
| 5:07:24| An older racing legend wrecks on the track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18444)|
| 5:07:27| just shy of the finish of his last race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18447)|
| 5:07:30| Lightning McQueen, who is the rookie, is a sure bet to win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18450)|
| 5:07:34| but he turns around and sees his hero crumpled in the grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18454)|
| 5:07:37| and goes to push him over the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18457)|
| 5:07:39| Meanwhile, his self-important rival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18459)|
| 5:07:41| speeds across the finish line to victory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18461)|
| 5:07:43| without a glance backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18463)|
| 5:07:45| Nobody claps for him, but the crowd goes wild for McQueen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18465)|
| 5:07:49| This is what we're trying to teach our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18469)|
| 5:07:51| that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18471)|
| 5:07:52| you can win the race at all costs, or you can race well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18472)|
| 5:07:56| That caring for one another is more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18476)|
| 5:07:58| than being victorious, so you can often do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18478)|
| 5:08:01| I wish nothing ill on any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18481)|
| 5:08:03| I just wish you could see how your actions are hurting me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18483)|
| 5:08:06| my family, my friends, and our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18486)|
| 5:08:09| and find a better way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18489)|
| 5:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18491)|
| 5:08:13| Thank you, Madam Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18493)|
| 5:08:15| Naomi Elliott is our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18495)|
| 5:08:17| I see you in the window there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18497)|
| 5:08:19| If you would please turn your camera and microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18499)|
| 5:08:23| Ms. Elliott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18503)|
| 5:08:26| Yes, please mute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18506)|
| 5:08:28| Okay, if you would turn your camera on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18508)|
| 5:08:31| If you are, if you're quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18511)|
| 5:08:33| please give us your name and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18513)|
| 5:08:35| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18515)|
| 5:08:38| Hi, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18518)|
| 5:08:39| It's Naomi Elliott of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18519)|
| 5:08:41| Good to see y'all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18521)|
| 5:08:43| First and foremost, my husband said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18523)|
| 5:08:45| to make the constitutional carry legal here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18525)|
| 5:08:52| since that was forgotten about due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18532)|
| 5:08:54| Okay, but I'm here to speak about the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18534)|
| 5:08:59| We are under attack, and not from an invisible enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18539)|
| 5:09:03| We are under attack by pen and paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18543)|
| 5:09:06| Who was it that said that's how we would be attacked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18546)|
| 5:09:10| Was it Thomas Jefferson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18550)|
| 5:09:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18551)|
| 5:09:12| I didn't study up on that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18552)|
| 5:09:14| That was a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18554)|
| 5:09:16| but I did read the Bill of Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18556)|
| 5:09:18| and I am very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18558)|
| 5:09:20| about the Board of Health's unconstitutional power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18560)|
| 5:09:23| In the Bill of Rights, it said that the rights of others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18563)|
| 5:09:26| shall not be abridged to protect others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18566)|
| 5:09:29| And in fact, in context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18569)|
| 5:09:31| when speaking about protections afforded by the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18571)|
| 5:09:35| it is talking about protections by militias| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18575)|
| 5:09:38| and by armies and navies, nothing about health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18578)|
| 5:09:42| We are responsible for our own health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18582)|
| 5:09:44| If the Board of Health wants to issue advisories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18584)|
| 5:09:47| recommendations, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18587)|
| 5:09:49| but they do not have the right to overstep their boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18589)|
| 5:09:52| by issuing unconstitutional mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18592)|
| 5:09:55| In the Constitution, it says that the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18595)|
| 5:09:58| and local areas have power to make laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18598)|
| 5:10:03| and ordinances on that level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18603)|
| 5:10:07| if afforded by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18607)|
| 5:10:10| If they are not prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18610)|
| 5:10:13| Anything not mentioned, but not prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18613)|
| 5:10:16| See, that's the key, is that this is prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18616)|
| 5:10:20| because they are not afforded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18620)|
| 5:10:23| They are prohibited that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18623)|
| 5:10:24| because of life, liberty, and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18624)|
| 5:10:27| They have no right to affect the quality of life of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18627)|
| 5:10:31| They have no right to take the liberties away from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18631)|
| 5:10:35| and they have no right to take the property away from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18635)|
| 5:10:38| whether it's current property or speculative property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18638)|
| 5:10:42| from these businesses that are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18642)|
| 5:10:44| And it is horrible seeing all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18644)|
| 5:10:46| that are adversely affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18646)|
| 5:10:49| We are under attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18649)|
| 5:10:51| This issue is not about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18651)|
| 5:10:53| It is not about curfews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18653)|
| 5:10:56| This issue is about our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18656)|
| 5:10:59| This issue is about our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18659)|
| 5:11:01| If these people don't want freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18661)|
| 5:11:03| and they don't want liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18663)|
| 5:11:04| let them go get some land somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18664)|
| 5:11:07| and talk to the Congress and legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18667)|
| 5:11:09| about seceding from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18669)|
| 5:11:11| But as we are a chartered county in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18671)|
| 5:11:15| under the United States Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18675)|
| 5:11:18| you have the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18678)|
| 5:11:21| to uphold that supreme law of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18681)|
| 5:11:24| That is supreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18684)|
| 5:11:25| Anything that contradicts that is null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18685)|
| 5:11:29| That means those ordinances, mandates, laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18689)|
| 5:11:32| if they contradict our rights and our freedoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18692)|
| 5:11:36| they're not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18696)|
| 5:11:37| That is why the sheriff said he will not go after people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18697)|
| 5:11:41| for violating those mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18701)|
| 5:11:43| because they are unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18703)|
| 5:11:45| You have the constitutional oath, as did I and many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18705)|
| 5:11:49| We have to fight for our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18709)|
| 5:11:53| I mean, who's gonna fight for them if we don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18713)|
| 5:11:55| We must protect our great land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18715)|
| 5:11:58| We are under attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18718)|
| 5:11:59| I do not want a one-world government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18719)|
| 5:12:02| I know that the great reset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18722)|
| 5:12:04| from both economic forms into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18724)|
| 5:12:06| but we have to protect our land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18726)|
| 5:12:08| starting here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18728)|
| 5:12:10| Thank you, Ms. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18730)|
| 5:12:14| Kevin Desmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18734)|
| 5:12:18| Kevin Desmond, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18738)|
| 5:12:23| You can turn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18743)|
| 5:12:24| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18744)|
| 5:12:25| Kevin Desmond, Elise Denaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18745)|
| 5:12:30| We have four more left, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18750)|
| 5:12:33| Ms. Denaney, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18753)|
| 5:12:34| please state your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18754)|
| 5:12:36| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18756)|
| 5:12:39| Chairman Jay, commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18759)|
| 5:12:41| We're rounding the quarter, final turn, yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18761)|
| 5:12:45| I'm Elise Denaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18765)|
| 5:12:46| I am an otolaryngologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18766)|
| 5:12:48| That's an ear, nose, and throat doctor in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18768)|
| 5:12:51| I've been here since 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18771)|
| 5:12:54| I'm also the past president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18774)|
| 5:12:56| of the Tennessee Medical Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18776)|
| 5:12:58| I am speaking out to support the Board of Health Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18778)|
| 5:13:02| You know, the Board of Health has a long history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18782)|
| 5:13:06| The mission has never changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18786)|
| 5:13:08| It's always been to protect the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18788)|
| 5:13:11| and the safety of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18791)|
| 5:13:13| This level of governance is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18793)|
| 5:13:15| because it allows for nimble adaptation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18795)|
| 5:13:18| to new health threats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18798)|
| 5:13:20| And to assign that level of governance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18800)|
| 5:13:23| to one individual is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18803)|
| 5:13:26| So why is this a problem now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18806)|
| 5:13:29| Has the Board of Health overreached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18809)|
| 5:13:31| with mask mandates, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18811)|
| 5:13:34| There have been hours of debate on the COVID strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18814)|
| 5:13:39| Goodness knows I'm at the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18819)|
| 5:13:41| at the state level, at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18821)|
| 5:13:43| It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18823)|
| 5:13:44| And I admit that data on masks is messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18824)|
| 5:13:48| And yes, there's divergent opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18828)|
| 5:13:50| even among my best friends and my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18830)|
| 5:13:53| Even the CDC's COVID guidance has been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18833)|
| 5:13:57| But you know, that's science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18837)|
| 5:13:59| As new data rolls out, the science continues to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18839)|
| 5:14:04| and we make new discoveries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18844)|
| 5:14:06| That's the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18846)|
| 5:14:07| So I'm gonna ask you to consider the metaphor of a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18847)|
| 5:14:12| Okay, you've got your family unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18852)|
| 5:14:14| We're getting together for Christmas and we make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18854)|
| 5:14:18| How big a tree do we buy, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18858)|
| 5:14:22| Well, everybody's involved in that decision, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18862)|
| 5:14:25| But we also know that mom and dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18865)|
| 5:14:27| have ultimate authority about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18867)|
| 5:14:30| We don't let the eight-year-old make the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18870)|
| 5:14:32| but mom and dad do make that decision in love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18872)|
| 5:14:35| and taking into consideration every family member's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18875)|
| 5:14:39| opposition, concerns, and grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18879)|
| 5:14:42| So I'm gonna circle back to the original charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18882)|
| 5:14:46| of protection and safety of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18886)|
| 5:14:48| Has the Board of Health fulfilled its brief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18888)|
| 5:14:52| To keep everybody safe has clearly caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18892)|
| 5:14:55| so much frustration and anger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18895)|
| 5:14:56| I've listened to all of it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18896)|
| 5:14:58| and I grieve for every one of those school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18898)|
| 5:15:01| who can't perform on the court right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18901)|
| 5:15:04| and we've gotta figure out a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18904)|
| 5:15:06| Restaurants are important to the community health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18906)|
| 5:15:08| as much as hospitals and groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18908)|
| 5:15:10| I know my mental health gets a shot in the arm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18910)|
| 5:15:13| every time I eat with my friends and have good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18913)|
| 5:15:16| But as a healthcare provider, changing the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18916)|
| 5:15:21| for this one issue right now will demoralize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18921)|
| 5:15:25| an already embattered health system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18925)|
| 5:15:29| We are exhausted and Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18929)|
| 5:15:34| we need your support right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18934)|
| 5:15:37| Thank you and Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18937)|
| 5:15:40| Thank you, Ms. Donati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18940)|
| 5:15:43| Lindsay Bryan, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18943)|
| 5:15:46| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18946)|
| 5:15:46| Please state your name and your county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18946)|
| 5:15:49| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18949)|
| 5:15:52| Hi, my name is Lindsay Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18952)|
| 5:15:53| I'm a resident of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18953)|
| 5:15:55| and I appreciate all of your patience tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18955)|
| 5:15:58| as I know it's been a long night for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18958)|
| 5:16:01| I have lived in Knoxville for nearly a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18961)|
| 5:16:04| I currently manage a team of 15 health coaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18964)|
| 5:16:07| between two Knoxville locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18967)|
| 5:16:09| I'm a wife and I'm a mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=18969)|

| 5:21:56| and mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19316)|
| 5:22:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19321)|
| 5:22:03| Mr. Jessel, please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19323)|
| 5:22:06| and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19326)|
| 5:22:07| and you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19327)|
| 5:22:11| Sure, thank you, Larson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19331)|
| 5:22:13| My name is Tanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19333)|
| 5:22:14| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19334)|
| 5:22:15| I have since 2007, and even before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19335)|
| 5:22:18| when I studied biology as an undergrad at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19338)|
| 5:22:22| Today, as a scientist myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19342)|
| 5:22:24| I've been very interested in the discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19344)|
| 5:22:26| about the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19346)|
| 5:22:27| And I follow the latest science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19347)|
| 5:22:30| on how to reduce risk during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19350)|
| 5:22:33| I haven't spoken at public forum until today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19353)|
| 5:22:36| because scientists caution against gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19356)|
| 5:22:39| in groups indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19359)|
| 5:22:41| Gathering indoors with people who decline to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19361)|
| 5:22:44| is a health risk I'm not willing to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19364)|
| 5:22:47| Especially now, as coronavirus cases surge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19367)|
| 5:22:50| in East Tennessee, where I've lived most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19370)|
| 5:22:53| most all of my patronage of local eateries and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19373)|
| 5:22:57| happens curbside, where scientists say the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19377)|
| 5:23:00| of spreading coronavirus is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19380)|
| 5:23:02| I do not enter stores that do not enforce a mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19382)|
| 5:23:06| and I preferentially patronize those who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19386)|
| 5:23:09| All signs indicate East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19389)|
| 5:23:12| has entered the most difficult stage of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19392)|
| 5:23:15| I propose tinkering with the mechanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19395)|
| 5:23:17| of the Board of Health at this juncture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19397)|
| 5:23:19| is a distraction at best and counterproductive at worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19399)|
| 5:23:24| Concerns over the Board of Health's mechanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19404)|
| 5:23:27| can be tended to after the present crisis passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19407)|
| 5:23:31| Meanwhile, a mandate from the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19411)|
| 5:23:34| is not functionally different from a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19414)|
| 5:23:37| from the Health Department Senior Director, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19417)|
| 5:23:40| Yet it is worth noting, as Mr. Comer did earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19420)|
| 5:23:45| that nationally, reports are one in 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19425)|
| 5:23:48| public health officials have left their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19428)|
| 5:23:50| as a result of pressures from the current crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19430)|
| 5:23:54| including, but not limited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19434)|
| 5:23:55| harassment from the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19435)|
| 5:23:58| and even elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19438)|
| 5:24:00| I have no doubt Dr. Buchanan is more than capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19440)|
| 5:24:04| of guiding our community through the present crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19444)|
| 5:24:07| However, the doctor is free to leave the role at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19447)|
| 5:24:11| and a glaring lack of firm support from elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19451)|
| 5:24:14| in Knox County offers strong incentive to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19454)|
| 5:24:18| Before placing all authority for issuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19458)|
| 5:24:20| public health orders in a health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19460)|
| 5:24:23| director's hands, a county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19463)|
| 5:24:25| should instill public confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19465)|
| 5:24:28| that timely, evidence-based public policy adaptations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19468)|
| 5:24:32| to swiftly moving public health challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19472)|
| 5:24:36| can be achieved under all contingencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19476)|
| 5:24:39| including the absence of a health department director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19479)|
| 5:24:43| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19483)|
| 5:24:45| Thank you, Mr. Jessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19485)|

| 5:24:52| which is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=19492)|

| 5:41:44| I can defer to Matt or Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20504)|

| 5:41:59| to start off the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20519)|

| 5:42:05| and I provided some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20525)|
| 5:42:07| We had a lot of great questions last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20527)|

| 5:42:21| Yeah, I think we hit a lot of the high points last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20541)|
| 5:42:26| and I'm glad to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20546)|
| 5:42:31| Mr. Myers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20551)|

| 5:42:39| than Mr. Mamentoff or Mr. Caldwell did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20559)|
| 5:42:42| We do have Mr. Phillip Welker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20562)|
| 5:42:46| from BNA Associates with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20566)|
| 5:42:49| He's been patient to hang out there with us for a few hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20569)|
| 5:42:53| so we appreciate you being on the call too, Mr. Welker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20573)|
| 5:42:56| and we will entertain any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20576)|
| 5:43:01| Open up the discussion to any commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20581)|
| 5:43:03| that wish to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20583)|
| 5:43:06| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20586)|
| 5:43:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20589)|
| 5:43:11| Again, I will just kind of reiterate some of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20591)|
| 5:43:14| that I made during the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20594)|
| 5:43:17| At the current time, I'm opposed to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20597)|
| 5:43:21| and the main reasons are that our procurement department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20601)|
| 5:43:27| gosh, two and a half years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20607)|
| 5:43:29| when they sent this out for an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20609)|
| 5:43:31| that they asked for certain statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20611)|
| 5:43:34| from the people that were bidding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20614)|
| 5:43:38| on the Andrew Johnson building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20618)|
| 5:43:41| and I think that we've totally gotten away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20621)|
| 5:43:44| from what was originally agreed on from the original RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20624)|
| 5:43:50| and have we possibly made it so that other individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20630)|
| 5:43:55| who were going to bid at that same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20635)|
| 5:43:58| were knocked out, and now they haven't had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20638)|
| 5:44:01| to have another chance to have a crack at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20641)|
| 5:44:07| Again, we were promised permanent jobs for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20647)|

| 5:44:29| to the procurement division that the local sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20669)|
| 5:44:32| and room tax would equate to over a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20672)|
| 5:44:35| per year, so we kept hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20675)|
| 5:44:40| from previous administrations that we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20680)|
| 5:44:43| to put this back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20683)|
| 5:44:45| to benefit the taxpayers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20685)|
| 5:44:49| If we're giving up 100 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20689)|
| 5:44:51| and we're giving up a monthly check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20691)|
| 5:44:54| for the hotel-motel tax, I don't see we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20694)|
| 5:44:58| the right thing for the taxpayers in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20698)|

| 5:46:56| is that right, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20816)|

| 5:47:01| It's authorizing the creation of the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20821)|
| 5:47:03| of the county of Knox and the city of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20823)|
| 5:47:10| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20830)|
| 5:47:12| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20832)|

| 5:47:19| This is to approve item number 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20839)|
| 5:47:22| We'll open up the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20842)|
| 5:47:24| I do believe we have Mr. Mametoff and Mr. Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20844)|
| 5:47:28| as well on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20848)|
| 5:47:29| Commissioner Ward, you're up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20849)|
| 5:47:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20852)|
| 5:47:34| For everybody watching, Eric Weider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20854)|
| 5:47:36| the guy that spoke at the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20856)|
| 5:47:39| was my campaign manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20859)|
| 5:47:40| and I think he's texting me four times a day about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20860)|
| 5:47:44| I only had one question just to clarify from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20864)|
| 5:47:49| We have the authority to disband the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20869)|
| 5:47:54| once we create it, correct or not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20874)|
| 5:47:58| You jointly have that authority with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20878)|
| 5:48:00| if it's a joint board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20880)|
| 5:48:02| If you would just state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20882)|
| 5:48:04| for the record again, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20884)|
| 5:48:05| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20885)|
| 5:48:06| I'm sorry, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20886)|
| 5:48:08| This is Martin Mametoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20888)|
| 5:48:13| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20893)|
| 5:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20895)|
| 5:48:17| Commissioner Ward, did you have additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20897)|
| 5:48:20| No, that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20900)|
| 5:48:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20901)|
| 5:48:22| Commissioner Daley, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20902)|
| 5:48:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20904)|
| 5:48:26| Martin, normally how long are these bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20906)|
| 5:48:30| set out there for, 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20910)|
| 5:48:33| Most bond issues these days are 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20913)|
| 5:48:35| but given the long life of this asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20915)|
| 5:48:39| and the typical financing for this type of project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20919)|
| 5:48:44| would likely be 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20924)|
| 5:48:46| although until we dive deeper into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20926)|
| 5:48:49| but I would say that is more likely than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20929)|
| 5:48:52| So we're projected to bring in 400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20932)|
| 5:48:56| let's just say 500,000 if we're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20936)|
| 5:48:59| So how many years is that gonna take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20939)|
| 5:49:01| to pay off a $30 million debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20941)|
| 5:49:04| Yeah, no, this particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20944)|
| 5:49:08| right now as state law has written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20948)|
| 5:49:10| if we get the money that already state law provides for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20950)|
| 5:49:14| it would only cover roughly 10 to 15% of the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20954)|
| 5:49:18| We are definitely gonna seek to expand that legislatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20958)|
| 5:49:22| which is why we wanted to try to get this in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20962)|
| 5:49:24| so that we would be ready for the legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20964)|
| 5:49:26| We're trying to be very deliberate and very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20966)|
| 5:49:30| and move and not do as the gentleman said before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20970)|
| 5:49:36| with haste and make some of the mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20976)|
| 5:49:38| that they made on the sound stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20978)|
| 5:49:40| So that, and one of the things that we wanna do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20980)|
| 5:49:42| is to be set up to expand the area beyond this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20982)|
| 5:49:47| to pick up the entire development area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20987)|
| 5:49:49| pick up much more sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20989)|
| 5:49:51| We hope if we are successful in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20991)|
| 5:49:54| we might be able to cover somewhere between 25 and 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20994)|
| 5:49:57| of the debt service from the incremental sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=20997)|
| 5:50:01| from around the stadium area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21001)|
| 5:50:03| Can I just jump in with just a quick point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21003)|
| 5:50:06| What was before us tonight is just a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21006)|
| 5:50:09| on the formation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21009)|
| 5:50:10| Doesn't have anything to do with finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21010)|
| 5:50:12| It doesn't have anything to do with commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21012)|
| 5:50:14| And it certainly doesn't have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21014)|
| 5:50:16| with an actual plan in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21016)|
| 5:50:17| All of that comes back to commission in future steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21017)|
| 5:50:20| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21020)|
| 5:50:23| I don't think so because that all part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21023)|
| 5:50:25| of the doing the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21025)|
| 5:50:28| We need to know the bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21028)|
| 5:50:29| We need to know everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21029)|
| 5:50:31| I understand, but if I'm clear, Mr. Mametoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21031)|
| 5:50:34| any future decisions based on financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21034)|
| 5:50:37| would come back to County Commission for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21037)|
| 5:50:39| at a much different stage in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21039)|
| 5:50:43| That's right, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21043)|
| 5:50:44| I took Commissioner Daly's question though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21044)|
| 5:50:47| in terms of, is it worth it to form a sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21047)|
| 5:50:50| in terms of the benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21050)|
| 5:50:51| And so I was trying to give an overview of the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21051)|
| 5:50:54| I think that's, and you can correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21054)|
| 5:50:56| if I'm wrong, Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21056)|
| 5:50:57| but I think you were trying to get a handle on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21057)|
| 5:50:58| is this really worth doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21058)|
| 5:51:00| Correct, that's, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21060)|
| 5:51:03| And thank you very much for, there's a whole lot to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21063)|
| 5:51:06| I mean, I have no problem with voting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21066)|
| 5:51:09| to do start the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21069)|
| 5:51:12| but we may have a whole lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21072)|
| 5:51:14| when it comes to financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21074)|
| 5:51:16| I think you all will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21076)|
| 5:51:17| And we're excited that if you all will give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21077)|
| 5:51:19| the opportunity to try to pull something together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21079)|
| 5:51:21| for your consideration in several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21081)|
| 5:51:24| probably a few months off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21084)|
| 5:51:25| we will certainly try to do our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21085)|
| 5:51:27| to bring you a transparent and a good product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21087)|
| 5:51:32| that the whole community can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21092)|
| 5:51:36| Probably already know the answer to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21096)|
| 5:51:38| but would any member of this sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21098)|
| 5:51:41| be paid for their service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21101)|
| 5:51:44| No, they wouldn't be paid for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21104)|
| 5:51:46| You're allowed to reimburse them for expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21106)|
| 5:51:48| in the words that they have to pay for their lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21108)|
| 5:51:50| but you can't pay them to serve on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21110)|
| 5:51:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21113)|
| 5:51:55| Thank you, Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21115)|
| 5:51:56| and thank you, Mark, for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21116)|
| 5:51:57| Commissioner Smith, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21117)|
| 5:52:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21123)|
| 5:52:07| I understand the statement that you just made, Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21127)|
| 5:52:10| but I do wanna say this, that as this moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21130)|
| 5:52:14| I will be looking very closely to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21134)|
| 5:52:18| that the revenues that come in for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21138)|
| 5:52:20| are not diverted revenues that could go elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21140)|
| 5:52:24| I did have a question to Mr. Mametal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21144)|
| 5:52:28| When you say jointly dissolved, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21148)|
| 5:52:35| That means that state law says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21155)|
| 5:52:37| that if the municipal entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21157)|
| 5:52:39| which in this case are the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21159)|
| 5:52:42| would jointly decide that the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21162)|
| 5:52:44| is no longer needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21164)|
| 5:52:46| and they don't have any bonds outstanding on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21166)|
| 5:52:47| which you can't dissolve them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21167)|
| 5:52:49| once they finance something, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21169)|
| 5:52:51| but if you all decide you don't wanna move together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21171)|
| 5:52:53| with the baseball project and then both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21173)|
| 5:52:58| by resolution, the two governing bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21178)|
| 5:53:00| just as we've gone through the formation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21180)|
| 5:53:02| could vote to dissolve the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21182)|
| 5:53:05| It doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21185)|
| 5:53:07| I was amused to look in Memphis, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21187)|
| 5:53:11| I think they formed at least five or six sports authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21191)|
| 5:53:14| of which only one is still active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21194)|
| 5:53:16| because they just let them dissolve administratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21196)|
| 5:53:20| because they have no assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21200)|
| 5:53:22| But by resolution, you all could jointly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21202)|
| 5:53:26| But what would happen if moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21206)|
| 5:53:30| say the city or the county decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21210)|
| 5:53:32| they wanted to no longer be a part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21212)|
| 5:53:35| So we would not be able to just vote as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21215)|
| 5:53:38| to say, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21218)|
| 5:53:42| Well, if the county decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21222)|
| 5:53:46| that they didn't wanna be a part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21226)|
| 5:53:47| or the city decided they wouldn't be part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21227)|
| 5:53:50| then the need for a joint board would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21230)|
| 5:53:52| And so if the county wanted to run with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21232)|
| 5:53:56| and take control of it, or the city wanted to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21236)|
| 5:53:59| again, obviously, so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21239)|
| 5:54:02| our goal at the direction of both mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21242)|
| 5:54:05| has to bring you all a joint project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21245)|
| 5:54:06| to mitigate the financial risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21246)|
| 5:54:08| to both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21248)|
| 5:54:10| But if either one of them decided to go their own way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21250)|
| 5:54:12| and still wanted to pursue the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21252)|
| 5:54:14| with the baseball team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21254)|
| 5:54:16| you would likely go and form your own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21256)|
| 5:54:18| standalone sports authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21258)|
| 5:54:23| We would have to have permission from city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21263)|
| 5:54:25| to be released from the sports authority moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21265)|
| 5:54:29| if we chose to do joint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21269)|
| 5:54:31| You could just ignore the one we're forming now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21271)|
| 5:54:33| and just start over again and form your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21273)|
| 5:54:36| Okay, is there any kind of timeframe on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21276)|
| 5:54:40| in the bylaws or creation of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21280)|
| 5:54:42| And is that any possibility that you could put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21282)|
| 5:54:46| or would that hinder financing if we did move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21286)|
| 5:54:50| The charter has no time limitation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21290)|
| 5:54:53| The really the only limitation is if you jointly decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21293)|
| 5:54:56| as I mentioned, that the project is not going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21296)|
| 5:55:00| and you jointly decide that, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21300)|
| 5:55:02| we don't really need a sports authority for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21302)|
| 5:55:05| A sports authority could, as we've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21305)|
| 5:55:07| help with these sports events and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21307)|
| 5:55:09| You may decide jointly that it could serve other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21309)|
| 5:55:12| But if you all both decided that a joint sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21312)|
| 5:55:15| is not in the best interest of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21315)|
| 5:55:17| you could jointly dissolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21317)|
| 5:55:19| Or if the county decided we just don't like the deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21319)|
| 5:55:21| we're getting on the baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21321)|
| 5:55:23| and we don't want to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21323)|
| 5:55:25| you've jointly approved the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21325)|
| 5:55:26| and you'll get to continue to do that as to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21326)|
| 5:55:30| But if the city wanted to proceed with the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21330)|
| 5:55:33| they likely would go and form their own sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21333)|
| 5:55:36| And this board would probably just either just go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21336)|
| 5:55:39| can we just sort of dissipate and stop and go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21339)|
| 5:55:43| on its own, even if you all couldn't jointly vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21343)|
| 5:55:46| to dissolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21346)|
| 5:55:50| But again, I'll go back to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21350)|
| 5:55:54| Three, four months from now, we decide that we want out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21354)|
| 5:55:57| We can't get out unless the city lets us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21357)|
| 5:56:01| Commissioner Smith, these are great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21361)|
| 5:56:02| I'm not trying to dodge answering them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21362)|
| 5:56:04| and I know you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21364)|
| 5:56:05| The bottom line is I'm having a hard time with get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21365)|
| 5:56:08| You have no contractual obligations to the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21368)|
| 5:56:11| Your only right is to approve the members of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21371)|
| 5:56:15| So, I mean, can you say, we want out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21375)|
| 5:56:19| city, will you take this sports authority away from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21379)|
| 5:56:22| Can we amend the charter to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21382)|
| 5:56:23| Yes, we could do that if that's what everybody decided to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21383)|
| 5:56:27| or you could say, we just want this thing to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21387)|
| 5:56:30| And if the city says no, those seven people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21390)|
| 5:56:33| that got pointed to the board are gonna enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21393)|
| 5:56:35| having lunch once a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21395)|
| 5:56:36| and that's all that board will ever do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21396)|
| 5:56:39| Okay, one final question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21399)|
| 5:56:41| and I know it's a hypothetical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21401)|
| 5:56:43| but let's say we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21403)|
| 5:56:47| and at some point we decide we don't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21407)|
| 5:56:53| after we've appointed the members of the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21413)|
| 5:56:56| we don't wanna move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21416)|
| 5:56:58| The city does not want to release us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21418)|
| 5:57:01| from our obligation to a sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21421)|
| 5:57:04| and they issue debt, but only the city's backing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21424)|
| 5:57:10| Is there any way that we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21430)|
| 5:57:14| to put it in layman's terms, co-signed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21434)|
| 5:57:18| These are all great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21438)|
| 5:57:20| I'm not trying to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21440)|
| 5:57:21| That's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21441)|
| 5:57:22| The answer is no, unless you agree to pledge your revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21442)|
| 5:57:25| or some sort of funding agreement to make up any shortfalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21445)|
| 5:57:28| you have no financial obligation whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21448)|
| 5:57:32| to pay any debts of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21452)|
| 5:57:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21455)|
| 5:57:36| Yeah, great questions, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21456)|
| 5:57:39| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21459)|
| 5:57:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21462)|
| 5:57:42| I just wanna ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21462)|
| 5:57:45| what is the pro and cons of creating a sports authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21465)|
| 5:57:52| Well, the pros, the initial pro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21472)|
| 5:57:57| and one reason we're trying to get this organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21477)|
| 5:57:59| as I mentioned, is that by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21479)|
| 5:58:01| you do get to capture the state's portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21481)|
| 5:58:04| of the sales tax revenues off the stadium itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21484)|
| 5:58:07| That's the low side, probably 350,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21487)|
| 5:58:11| probably the high side of half a million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21491)|
| 5:58:13| that Commissioner Daley mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21493)|
| 5:58:15| So that's a first step toward being prepared to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21495)|
| 5:58:20| if someday this body, as well as city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21500)|
| 5:58:23| decides to move forward with a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21503)|
| 5:58:26| with the baseball stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21506)|
| 5:58:28| So that's a big pro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21508)|
| 5:58:30| and that's sort of what started us down this path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21510)|
| 5:58:32| to be ready that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21512)|
| 5:58:34| If we're successful in expanding that legislatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21514)|
| 5:58:37| then that number will increase substantially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21517)|
| 5:58:40| and I think you all would be very happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21520)|
| 5:58:42| and that's certainly gonna be a goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21522)|
| 5:58:43| that we're going to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21523)|
| 5:58:45| So that would be yet another significant pro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21525)|
| 5:58:47| of having this sports authority in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21527)|
| 5:58:52| The other main reason, and I know it's very late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21532)|
| 5:58:54| and I know I like to hear myself talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21534)|
| 5:58:56| so I don't wanna keep you guys up too late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21536)|
| 5:58:58| but there are very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21538)|
| 5:59:01| and I know we spent a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21541)|
| 5:59:02| on the Constitution tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21542)|
| 5:59:04| but there are Tennessee constitutional reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21544)|
| 5:59:06| why most stadiums are financed in Nashville and Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21546)|
| 5:59:09| using a sports authority or a similar entity route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21549)|
| 5:59:13| The Jackson Stadium that was mentioned before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21553)|
| 5:59:15| was done way back in the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21555)|
| 5:59:17| I actually did that financing way back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21557)|
| 5:59:20| and just at that time, it was not the state of the art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21560)|
| 5:59:23| for doing those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21563)|
| 5:59:24| It was a much less expensive stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21564)|
| 5:59:26| and not in the same sort of caliber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21566)|
| 5:59:28| that we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21568)|
| 5:59:31| But all the major stadiums in Metro Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21571)|
| 5:59:33| have been done this way and Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21573)|
| 5:59:37| And the reason they do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21577)|
| 5:59:38| is largely for constitutional reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21578)|
| 5:59:40| to avoid putting, as Commissioner Smith just asked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21580)|
| 5:59:44| the credit of the city or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21584)|
| 5:59:46| directly behind the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21586)|
| 5:59:49| There is a mechanism in the sports authority statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21589)|
| 5:59:51| for you to identify revenue streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21591)|
| 5:59:54| limited revenue streams that you're willing to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21594)|
| 5:59:56| to help pay the bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21596)|
| 5:59:58| without putting the full faith and credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21598)|
| 6:00:01| of the county or the city behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21601)|
| 6:00:03| So as we mentioned at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21603)|
| 6:00:05| we hope that we will be able to eventually use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21605)|
| 6:00:09| and largely pay any of the county's share of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21609)|
| 6:00:12| from hotel motel tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21612)|
| 6:00:14| So if we're able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21614)|
| 6:00:16| and we can show strong coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21616)|
| 6:00:18| of hotel motel tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21618)|
| 6:00:20| and that is something you all are comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21620)|
| 6:00:22| and that's ultimately your decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21622)|
| 6:00:23| then for example, the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21623)|
| 6:00:25| would be the perfect route to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21625)|
| 6:00:27| And so again, it's a financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21627)|
| 6:00:29| it's the most flexible financing tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21629)|
| 6:00:32| for this type of project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21632)|
| 6:00:34| that I can bring to you guys to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21634)|
| 6:00:37| There are alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21637)|
| 6:00:38| Again, the gentleman who spoke earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21638)|
| 6:00:40| that Commissioner Ward mentioned, was very knowledgeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21640)|
| 6:00:43| Could you do this through a PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21643)|
| 6:00:45| Yes, but the funding mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21645)|
| 6:00:47| that I just talked about, public building authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21647)|
| 6:00:48| which we do have a joint one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21648)|
| 6:00:50| is not available to the public building authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21650)|
| 6:00:52| That's why I'm suggesting that we form this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21652)|
| 6:00:54| versus using the existing public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21654)|
| 6:00:56| because of the funding tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21656)|
| 6:00:58| that are available to the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21658)|
| 6:01:00| that are not available to a public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21660)|
| 6:01:03| And as I mentioned last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21663)|
| 6:01:04| there are the industrial development boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21664)|
| 6:01:06| that presently exist are not joint boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21666)|
| 6:01:09| And the feeling is if we're gonna collaborate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21669)|
| 6:01:11| the city and the county may feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21671)|
| 6:01:12| that we ought to figure out if a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21672)|
| 6:01:14| can collaborate on the appointment of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21674)|
| 6:01:17| And this is sort of a first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21677)|
| 6:01:18| in terms of can the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21678)|
| 6:01:21| work well together on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21681)|
| 6:01:22| by agreeing on the initial board of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21682)|
| 6:01:26| Okay, any cons from the past or any lessons learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21686)|
| 6:01:31| from other people that have created sports authorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21691)|
| 6:01:39| I'm sure there are some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21699)|
| 6:01:41| I mean, I would be disparaging other sports authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21701)|
| 6:01:46| but certainly we've learned from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21706)|
| 6:01:48| and there's been litigation as to compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21708)|
| 6:01:51| with open meeting laws recently that we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21711)|
| 6:01:54| if you all choose to allow us to form the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21714)|
| 6:01:59| then obviously they will have to be fully trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21719)|
| 6:02:02| to comply with the Sunshine Laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21722)|
| 6:02:05| in the same manner that you guys have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21725)|
| 6:02:07| to have an ethics policy, just like you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21727)|
| 6:02:13| And there are, I'm sorry, Commissioner Lundy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21733)|
| 6:02:19| I'd love to say, hey, here's a problem that arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21739)|
| 6:02:22| I mean, the gentleman mentioned the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21742)|
| 6:02:25| with the sound stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21745)|
| 6:02:26| I do think that that was not handled well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21746)|
| 6:02:28| I think that was a combination of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21748)|
| 6:02:31| I'm not sure it was the sports authority's existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21751)|
| 6:02:34| that resulted in that, but it's certainly something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21754)|
| 6:02:36| that we're cognizant of and we'll make work hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21756)|
| 6:02:39| to not have the same sort of cost overrun issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21759)|
| 6:02:43| that they faced on the sound stadium in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21763)|
| 6:02:47| Thank you, I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21767)|
| 6:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21769)|
| 6:02:51| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21771)|
| 6:02:52| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21772)|
| 6:02:54| Larry, you do not serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21774)|
| 6:02:57| Hey, Commissioner Biggs, I'm great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21777)|
| 6:02:58| I'm a little hoarse, I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21778)|
| 6:03:00| I feel great, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21780)|
| 6:03:02| Rona, so I wanted to talk to you for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21782)|
| 6:03:05| because last week I watched the city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21785)|
| 6:03:11| and whenever they were talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21791)|
| 6:03:13| Councilwoman Amelia Parker was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21793)|
| 6:03:16| maybe postponing the vote because she wanted to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21796)|
| 6:03:18| about maybe hosting a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21798)|
| 6:03:21| And we were talking about maybe kind of commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21801)|
| 6:03:24| and council getting together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21804)|
| 6:03:25| but you said that there was a essence, not of urgency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21805)|
| 6:03:29| but basically what we had to do was make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21809)|
| 6:03:31| that we realized that the sports authority's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21811)|
| 6:03:35| not geared just towards the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21815)|
| 6:03:37| And we had to make sure that people realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21817)|
| 6:03:40| that there are going to be options for us to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21820)|
| 6:03:44| and there's gonna be options for us to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21824)|
| 6:03:46| Has, and I don't know, and this is the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21826)|
| 6:03:48| why I wanted to ask you, has there been anything scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21828)|
| 6:03:52| on the city's part, timeline-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21832)|
| 6:03:55| for us to be able to come together with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21835)|
| 6:03:58| Because I'm interested in doing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21838)|
| 6:04:01| Not like a collaboration, but kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21841)|
| 6:04:03| a collaboration meeting where we can get all the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21843)|
| 6:04:06| facts, and figures, and just kind of brainstorm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21846)|
| 6:04:11| I hope that we have multiple workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21851)|
| 6:04:14| and to the extent you all are willing to do them jointly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21854)|
| 6:04:16| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21856)|
| 6:04:18| No, obviously with just having had the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21858)|
| 6:04:21| of city council last week, and if you all decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21861)|
| 6:04:25| I mean, if the indication from you all and I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21865)|
| 6:04:29| we just don't wanna pursue the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21869)|
| 6:04:30| which I don't sense that's the case at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21870)|
| 6:04:32| that you guys are very interested in looking into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21872)|
| 6:04:34| at least, then we wouldn't obviously take your time up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21874)|
| 6:04:37| with workshops and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21877)|
| 6:04:39| But I do think, I know I've mentioned two or three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21879)|
| 6:04:44| about legislative issues and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21884)|
| 6:04:46| I would encourage you to let us try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21886)|
| 6:04:48| that legislation together at the very first of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21888)|
| 6:04:50| and let's try to shoot for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21890)|
| 6:04:52| maybe the third or fourth week of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21892)|
| 6:04:54| if you guys are willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21894)|
| 6:04:56| And we can dive as deep as you guys would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21896)|
| 6:05:00| into sports authorities, financing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21900)|
| 6:05:03| what other communities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21903)|
| 6:05:05| You know, we're sort of fortunate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21905)|
| 6:05:07| well, fortunate in many respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21907)|
| 6:05:09| We're fortunate because we have an owner of a baseball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21909)|
| 6:05:11| who loves Knoxville and wants to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21911)|
| 6:05:13| Now, a lot of these double A teams are shopped around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21913)|
| 6:05:15| trying to get the best deal they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21915)|
| 6:05:17| You know, Huntsville lost their team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21917)|
| 6:05:19| and they just basically, a suburb, much like Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21919)|
| 6:05:21| sort of bought back the double A team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21921)|
| 6:05:23| that Huntsville threw up from Biloxi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21923)|
| 6:05:25| And so we saw what a recent double A deal looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21925)|
| 6:05:29| They all, you know, so that's a good one for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21929)|
| 6:05:31| to share with you all sort of how that went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21931)|
| 6:05:33| And that stadium, ironically, was supposed to open this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21933)|
| 6:05:36| but it was not allowed to because of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21936)|
| 6:05:38| And so, but I think we can share a lot of good information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21938)|
| 6:05:42| with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21942)|
| 6:05:43| It's not gonna be the final deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21943)|
| 6:05:45| I think if we can have multiple workshops along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21945)|
| 6:05:48| Commissioner Biggs, I'm sure that I know that Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21948)|
| 6:05:50| and I would, and I'm sure the team, if you would like them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21950)|
| 6:05:54| we'd love to be able to do that for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21954)|
| 6:05:57| One of the things that I thought was interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21957)|
| 6:06:01| is they were talking about a job component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21961)|
| 6:06:02| and some of the things that it would bring here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21962)|
| 6:06:05| I would like to kind of know a little bit more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21965)|
| 6:06:08| you know, right after this is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21968)|
| 6:06:11| and kind of the direction that other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21971)|
| 6:06:14| and towns our size may have went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21974)|
| 6:06:15| just so we can kind of talk to our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21975)|
| 6:06:18| and let them know that there is gonna be more coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21978)|
| 6:06:21| So thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21981)|
| 6:06:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21982)|
| 6:06:23| Commissioner Biggs, this is Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21983)|
| 6:06:26| And to answer your question a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21986)|
| 6:06:28| I've talked this past week with Stephanie Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21988)|
| 6:06:31| and we have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21991)|
| 6:06:33| if this were to pass county commission tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21993)|
| 6:06:35| the possibility of in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21995)|
| 6:06:38| having a joint meeting of commission and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=21998)|
| 6:06:42| to go over information on the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22002)|
| 6:06:45| and some of the things that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22005)|
| 6:06:48| And so it is being talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22008)|
| 6:06:50| We're gonna see what happens here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22010)|
| 6:06:52| And, you know, we've got some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22012)|
| 6:06:54| and I think what the plan is as of now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22014)|
| 6:06:57| is for both mayors on those joint appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22017)|
| 6:07:00| to bring that back to commission and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22020)|
| 6:07:02| sometime in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22022)|
| 6:07:04| And so we would use January as potentially a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22024)|
| 6:07:08| to have a joint meeting of commission and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22028)|
| 6:07:12| to go over some ideas of the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22032)|
| 6:07:16| which is just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22036)|
| 6:07:17| And also come with you at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22037)|
| 6:07:19| with probably a schedule of what we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22039)|
| 6:07:22| from a timing standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22042)|
| 6:07:24| And so you can kind of get an idea of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22044)|
| 6:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22048)|
| 6:07:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22049)|
| 6:07:30| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22050)|
| 6:07:33| You're muted, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22053)|
| 6:07:37| You gotta take yourself off mute, Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22057)|
| 6:07:42| I thought I was off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22062)|
| 6:07:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22066)|
| 6:07:48| I went through the planning program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22068)|
| 6:07:51| where they were showing how this was gonna look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22071)|
| 6:07:53| And we're talking about a lot of dirt being moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22073)|
| 6:07:56| and getting the project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22076)|
| 6:07:59| And I don't know how the land has been acquired yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22079)|
| 6:08:02| or how we're gonna get the acquired land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22082)|
| 6:08:06| But when we get to a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22086)|
| 6:08:07| when the shovels go into the ground, we start digging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22087)|
| 6:08:11| And all of a sudden we find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22091)|
| 6:08:14| maybe this is not gonna work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22094)|
| 6:08:16| with the price that we really started at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22096)|
| 6:08:19| Is there a point that we can kind of say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22099)|
| 6:08:23| take our losses and run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22103)|
| 6:08:25| Is there a particular point that we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22105)|
| 6:08:27| Or does that go through the sports authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22107)|
| 6:08:31| I think Mr. Caldwell, you could probably answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22111)|
| 6:08:37| From the standpoint of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22117)|
| 6:08:39| and Mark can jump in here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22119)|
| 6:08:42| but as far as the land, it'll have to be donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22122)|
| 6:08:44| So the land that Mr. Boyd owns currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22124)|
| 6:08:49| would be donated to the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22129)|
| 6:08:52| There would be some, I'm sure some deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22132)|
| 6:08:56| and we'll work through that as we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22136)|
| 6:08:58| working out how to deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22138)|
| 6:09:00| But ultimately he would deed the land over to the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22140)|
| 6:09:05| and then the sports authority would oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22145)|
| 6:09:08| the construction of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22148)|
| 6:09:13| Okay, and the other thing right here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22153)|
| 6:09:15| is I was looking at the stadium that would be similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22155)|
| 6:09:18| to what we would be looking at was the St. Louis Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22158)|
| 6:09:26| But it left a big area for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22166)|
| 6:09:29| and I didn't see a big area of parking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22169)|
| 6:09:31| And I don't want this to come out to be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22171)|
| 6:09:33| the convention center where we have great things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22173)|
| 6:09:36| coming in here and no place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22176)|
| 6:09:39| Like I said, I would like to see more of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22179)|
| 6:09:43| and how we could get people in and out quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22183)|
| 6:09:46| and enjoy the process of going to a baseball game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22186)|
| 6:09:49| in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22189)|
| 6:09:50| But anyway, I guess we'll do that later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22190)|
| 6:09:52| in the planning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22192)|
| 6:09:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22193)|
| 6:09:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22196)|
| 6:09:57| Before I call on Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22197)|
| 6:09:58| I think just one follow up on that is my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22198)|
| 6:10:01| was the current property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22201)|
| 6:10:04| which is Mr. Boyd would be donating the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22204)|
| 6:10:08| and doing all the site prep and demolition of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22208)|
| 6:10:11| before it even was turned over to a sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22211)|
| 6:10:15| So that's nothing that would be part of the equation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22215)|
| 6:10:18| when it came to the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22218)|
| 6:10:20| I think that's all to be done on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22220)|
| 6:10:22| It's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22222)|
| 6:10:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22224)|
| 6:10:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22227)|
| 6:10:28| You know, most people really love the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22228)|
| 6:10:30| of a baseball team back here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22230)|
| 6:10:34| But a lot of people get heartburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22234)|
| 6:10:36| when you start to talk about a public private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22236)|
| 6:10:40| I'm naturally pretty skeptic and cautious with these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22240)|
| 6:10:44| And we'll be following, when the numbers start to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22244)|
| 6:10:48| to where I'll really start to dive down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22248)|
| 6:10:51| And I understand at this point what Mr. Mammothoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22251)|
| 6:10:55| is telling us that this is the best avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22255)|
| 6:10:58| and also that the creation of this is simply the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22258)|
| 6:11:03| And we need to do this to get moving in some direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22263)|
| 6:11:09| to where we can get to the answers to these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22269)|
| 6:11:13| So with this just being the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22273)|
| 6:11:17| with a lot of information to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22277)|
| 6:11:20| I just wanna make sure everybody realizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22280)|
| 6:11:22| that I'll be supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22282)|
| 6:11:24| but I will be looking at this very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22284)|
| 6:11:27| as it moves forward to make sure this is something good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22287)|
| 6:11:31| for Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22291)|
| 6:11:34| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22294)|
| 6:11:36| Seeing no other hands raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22296)|
| 6:11:39| we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22299)|
| 6:11:41| to approve with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22301)|
| 6:11:45| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22305)|
| 6:11:47| Madam Clerk, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22307)|

| 6:12:31| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22351)|
| 6:12:31| Item number 36 passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22351)|
| 6:12:33| I've had two requests for a very quick bio break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22353)|
| 6:12:38| so I will put into recess for no more than 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22358)|
| 6:12:44| If everybody's back before then, we'll start again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22364)|
| 6:12:46| but no more than 11.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22366)|
| 6:12:48| We'll actually tackle number 40 first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22368)|
| 6:12:52| because that will be relatively quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22372)|
| 6:12:54| and then we will finish up with item number 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22374)|
| 6:12:57| So this meeting is in recess for 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22377)|
| 6:13:01| Okay, we'll start back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22381)|
| 6:13:03| I'll bring this meeting back into order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22383)|
| 6:13:08| All members are still present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22388)|
| 6:13:11| Madam Clerk, I would like to jump to item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22391)|
| 6:13:17| It's the second of our two ordinances to talk tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22397)|
| 6:13:20| It's ordinance O-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22400)|
| 6:13:23| I'm sorry, ordinance O-20-11-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22403)|
| 6:13:27| It's amending chapter 27, article one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22407)|
| 6:13:30| sections two seven dash one and two seven dash nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22410)|

| 6:13:38| on the grounds of county-owned playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22418)|
| 6:13:41| This amends ordinance O-10-4-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22421)|
| 6:13:45| adopted May 24th, 2010, and this is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22425)|
| 6:13:51| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22431)|
| 6:13:55| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22435)|

| 6:14:00| second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22440)|
| 6:14:02| Sorry, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22442)|
| 6:14:11| Did the clerk finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22451)|
| 6:14:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22453)|
| 6:14:14| The projector just rebooted, it's coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22454)|
| 6:14:19| Okay, item number 40, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22459)|
| 6:14:20| Yeah, there is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22460)|
| 6:14:23| Please mute, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22463)|

| 6:15:23| I thought we were gonna include vaping also with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22523)|
| 6:15:26| I think we talked about that last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22526)|
| 6:15:28| but I'm gonna vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22528)|
| 6:15:30| I just wondered why we didn't include vaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22530)|
| 6:15:32| as an amendment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22532)|
| 6:15:35| We can't change the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22535)|
| 6:15:38| We can add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22538)|
| 6:15:45| I don't believe we can at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22545)|
| 6:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22548)|

| 6:16:26| to serve as an advisory board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22586)|
| 6:16:27| to the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22587)|
| 6:16:29| This amends ordinance O-96-3-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22589)|
| 6:16:33| adopted April 22nd, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22593)|

| 6:16:52| Commissioner Ward on the first to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22612)|
| 6:16:56| Open up the conversation for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22616)|
| 6:16:58| and look to the sponsor of the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22618)|
| 6:17:00| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22620)|
| 6:17:01| Thanks, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22621)|
| 6:17:04| I'm just gonna kind of reiterate what I said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22624)|
| 6:17:08| I support the five core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22628)|
| 6:17:10| I support people wearing masks in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22630)|
| 6:17:13| I have a strong confidence in Dr. Buchanan and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22633)|
| 6:17:17| And I wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22637)|
| 6:17:23| for me, it's very simple, constitutional conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22643)|
| 6:17:28| I think this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22648)|
| 6:17:31| This is nothing against the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22651)|
| 6:17:33| They'll still be involved in the advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22653)|
| 6:17:36| And the new advisory role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22656)|
| 6:17:38| they'll be able to talk to Dr. Buchanan whenever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22658)|
| 6:17:41| They won't have to sunshine any laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22661)|
| 6:17:42| or anything like that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22662)|
| 6:17:44| That's all I have to say for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22664)|
| 6:17:48| Other discussion amongst commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22668)|
| 6:17:53| Raise your hand, put your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22673)|
| 6:18:02| Commissioner Smith and then Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22682)|
| 6:18:06| I believe Commissioner Durrett was a 10th of a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22686)|
| 6:18:10| before me on getting her hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22690)|
| 6:18:13| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22693)|
| 6:18:18| It's fine, I'll yield to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22698)|
| 6:18:20| I had to move locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22700)|
| 6:18:21| so I'm getting all my papers together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22701)|
| 6:18:25| Back to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22705)|
| 6:18:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22709)|
| 6:18:33| I have really, really struggled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22713)|
| 6:18:36| I agree with Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22716)|
| 6:18:41| about the constitutionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22721)|
| 6:18:46| Commissioner Buehler's words last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22726)|
| 6:18:49| about the process and how our government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22729)|
| 6:18:57| But at the same time, I agree with Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22737)|
| 6:19:03| and this simply takes a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22743)|
| 6:19:08| and puts the power upon one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22748)|
| 6:19:12| I have struggled with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22752)|
| 6:19:13| because I want to do one thing more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22753)|
| 6:19:17| And this is what I'm struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22757)|
| 6:19:20| What can we do that unites the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22760)|
| 6:19:24| in the best way so that we can all work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22764)|
| 6:19:28| and move forward through this epidemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22768)|
| 6:19:32| We hear so much from both sides as to the science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22772)|
| 6:19:37| and the different theories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22777)|
| 6:19:39| And I've said all along, science is a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22779)|
| 6:19:44| These people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22784)|
| 6:19:47| I don't think any of them claim to know everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22787)|
| 6:19:51| They are just trying to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22791)|
| 6:19:53| the best suggestions that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22793)|
| 6:19:56| for what should be the best things to keep us safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22796)|
| 6:20:03| and to keep the spread down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22803)|
| 6:20:09| The problem we have with the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22809)|
| 6:20:12| and I admire and respect all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22812)|
| 6:20:14| for the job they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22814)|
| 6:20:16| and all the people in the health industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22816)|
| 6:20:19| There was a gentleman that spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22819)|
| 6:20:21| there were quite a few speakers that were very elegant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22821)|
| 6:20:25| and far more articulate than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22825)|
| 6:20:29| but one who spent most of his time thanking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22829)|
| 6:20:33| And I really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22833)|
| 6:20:37| I have struggled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22837)|
| 6:20:40| The Board of Health is hindered because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22840)|
| 6:20:43| quite frankly, they're not politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22843)|
| 6:20:46| And they are kind of narrowly focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22846)|
| 6:20:51| Last week, whenever that agenda came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22851)|
| 6:20:54| that kind of sent chills up my back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22854)|
| 6:20:57| But then they walked it back at their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22857)|
| 6:21:00| And I had been very encouraged by their previous meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22860)|
| 6:21:05| So I'm telling you, I'm really struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22865)|
| 6:21:08| I'm usually a very decisive person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22868)|
| 6:21:11| and can analyze things and weigh through the emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22871)|
| 6:21:15| and come to a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22875)|
| 6:21:17| But I have seriously struggled with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22877)|
| 6:21:20| because what I really want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22880)|
| 6:21:23| is find what's gonna unite this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22883)|
| 6:21:26| and our people to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22886)|
| 6:21:29| We all need to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22889)|
| 6:21:32| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22892)|
| 6:21:34| I see hands from Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22894)|
| 6:21:37| Durrett, actually Durrett Bussler at Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22897)|
| 6:21:42| So I'll turn it over to Commissioner Durrett next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22902)|
| 6:21:51| You're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22911)|
| 6:21:55| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22915)|
| 6:21:58| Commissioner Smith, I agree wholeheartedly with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22918)|
| 6:22:01| that we really need to do what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22921)|
| 6:22:05| to get people to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22925)|
| 6:22:07| And that gentleman you were speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22927)|
| 6:22:08| where he thanked people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22928)|
| 6:22:10| it really struck a chord with me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22930)|
| 6:22:13| And he spent his time rather than stating his case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22933)|
| 6:22:17| just thanking people for what they have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22937)|
| 6:22:19| thanking us for being here and listening to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22939)|
| 6:22:23| speak their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22943)|
| 6:22:24| And that's huge, it spoke volumes to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22944)|
| 6:22:29| in the three minutes or less that he spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22949)|
| 6:22:34| To the government aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22954)|
| 6:22:37| the operational aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22957)|
| 6:22:40| in 2012, Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22960)|
| 6:22:43| established the Community Health Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22963)|
| 6:22:46| with section 38-59 of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22966)|
| 6:22:50| And this council has varying duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22970)|
| 6:22:55| but specifically in subsection seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22975)|
| 6:22:57| it states, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22977)|
| 6:22:59| to act as an advisory body to elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22979)|
| 6:23:02| and appointed officials in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22982)|
| 6:23:05| the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22985)|
| 6:23:08| And that membership should not exceed 21 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22988)|
| 6:23:14| with legislative bodies that being Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22994)|
| 6:23:17| the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22997)|
| 6:23:19| each having the ability to appoint a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=22999)|
| 6:23:22| as well as the city and county mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23002)|
| 6:23:27| and the executive of the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23007)|
| 6:23:30| being able to also appoint members to this council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23010)|
| 6:23:35| And currently, the Community Health Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23015)|
| 6:23:37| is made up of 15 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23017)|
| 6:23:40| varying from Dr. Buchanan and Chief Thomas from KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23020)|
| 6:23:47| There's a member of City Parks and Rec on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23027)|
| 6:23:52| It's a varying viewpoint of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23032)|
| 6:23:56| and it does include health members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23036)|
| 6:23:58| but it also includes different people from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23038)|
| 6:24:02| from the county and from the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23042)|
| 6:24:07| And so we've got this already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23047)|
| 6:24:09| If we move the Board of Health to another advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23049)|
| 6:24:16| it's just like we're just tacking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23056)|
| 6:24:19| a board after board after board for advisory purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23059)|
| 6:24:23| We just created a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23063)|
| 6:24:24| We have this Community Health Council already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23064)|
| 6:24:30| This one, the Board of Health right now is able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23070)|
| 6:24:36| from state law, do these mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23076)|
| 6:24:39| And while they're temporary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23079)|
| 6:24:44| never before up until this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23084)|
| 6:24:47| have they enacted any kind of mandate until it was necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23087)|
| 6:24:52| until there was a public health crisis, which we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23092)|
| 6:24:55| And getting, and let's just go through this action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23095)|
| 6:25:00| the ordinance as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23100)|
| 6:25:01| It says we are repealing section 38-33 subsections A and B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23101)|
| 6:25:10| and to repeal in its entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23110)|
| 6:25:12| meaning we are essentially, not essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23112)|
| 6:25:15| we are abolishing the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23115)|
| 6:25:17| We are dissolving the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23117)|
| 6:25:19| And then we are creating an advisory Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23119)|
| 6:25:23| To me, that creates question in the process of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23123)|
| 6:25:28| by dissolving it, we therefore then have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23128)|
| 6:25:32| reconstitute its members, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23132)|
| 6:25:36| I mean, if we're getting rid of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23136)|
| 6:25:39| and then creating this new one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23139)|
| 6:25:41| that would be an advisory role only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23141)|
| 6:25:44| do we not have to go back through the nomination process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23144)|
| 6:25:48| for those two physicians and the dentist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23148)|
| 6:25:51| and the veterinarian and the citizen representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23151)|
| 6:25:55| So that's a question I have about this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23155)|
| 6:25:58| and the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23158)|
| 6:26:01| And I've taken up some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23161)|
| 6:26:03| I have, so that's the government aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23163)|
| 6:26:06| I have an opinion, but I'll let other people speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23166)|
| 6:26:12| But I would like to know how we proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23172)|
| 6:26:18| if we do move forward with the dissolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23178)|
| 6:26:21| of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23181)|
| 6:26:23| in establishing this advisory Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23183)|
| 6:26:29| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23189)|
| 6:26:32| and then Commissioner Hill after Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23192)|
| 6:26:37| You're on mute, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23197)|
| 6:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23200)|
| 6:26:45| From my understanding, this is an amendment to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23205)|
| 6:26:48| We're not doing away with it, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23208)|
| 6:26:51| I think that's what Mr. Ward said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23211)|
| 6:26:53| that we're not doing away with it or disbanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23213)|
| 6:26:57| We're just reconstituting what its actions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23217)|
| 6:27:02| But I have really listened to the people when they speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23222)|
| 6:27:07| and I put notes down to remind me of certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23227)|
| 6:27:11| that they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23231)|
| 6:27:14| Dr. Buchanan is our health director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23234)|
| 6:27:18| She is constituted by the state also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23238)|
| 6:27:21| that she reports to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23241)|
| 6:27:23| And she has the power to mandate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23243)|
| 6:27:26| Just like somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23246)|
| 6:27:28| well, we're not sure putting power in one person's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23248)|
| 6:27:31| Well, we put power in the mayor's hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23251)|
| 6:27:33| we put power in the governor's hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23253)|
| 6:27:35| and those are one person's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23255)|
| 6:27:37| But they respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23257)|
| 6:27:41| or they have somebody they have to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23261)|
| 6:27:45| Most of it is the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23265)|
| 6:27:47| and we have to respond to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23267)|
| 6:27:51| She has the knowledge and the people in her department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23271)|
| 6:27:54| right now that she can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23274)|
| 6:27:57| and get information from her own department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23277)|
| 6:28:00| and do very quickly make a decision on what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23280)|
| 6:28:06| We talk about epidemiology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23286)|
| 6:28:08| we don't have one on this board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23288)|
| 6:28:11| We don't have somebody that's very astute in viruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23291)|
| 6:28:20| The one thing that we did is this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23300)|
| 6:28:23| that we're sitting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23303)|
| 6:28:25| the commission constituted the board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23305)|
| 6:28:30| And I talked to an old, old commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23310)|
| 6:28:34| and asked what he thought when they were doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23314)|
| 6:28:38| And I may not remember that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23318)|
| 6:28:40| but he did say, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23320)|
| 6:28:43| we were doing it as an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23323)|
| 6:28:45| And I said, well, you put some language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23325)|
| 6:28:47| that made it more of a controlling board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23327)|
| 6:28:53| But the thing of it is we lose sight of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23333)|
| 6:28:56| that put us in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23336)|
| 6:28:59| They're concerned, they're scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23339)|
| 6:29:02| We've never given them any positive, anything to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23342)|
| 6:29:05| Every time you turn around, we're talking about deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23345)|
| 6:29:08| we're talking about isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23348)|
| 6:29:12| And being inside of a house, is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23352)|
| 6:29:16| I've got a 95 year old mother-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23356)|
| 6:29:18| that was inside a nursing home that had doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23358)|
| 6:29:22| and supposed to have things in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23362)|
| 6:29:25| to keep them from getting sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23365)|
| 6:29:28| Well, the whole thing is shut down now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23368)|
| 6:29:30| because every old person in that has the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23370)|
| 6:29:36| I cannot see my mother-in-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23376)|
| 6:29:39| I can't even go look at her through a window now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23379)|
| 6:29:42| because of the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23382)|
| 6:29:45| I follow the five guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23385)|
| 6:29:48| that the health department gives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23388)|
| 6:29:54| And where you're supposed to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23394)|
| 6:29:56| or you're not supposed to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23396)|
| 6:29:58| I wear a mask in public and when I'm inside of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23398)|
| 6:30:02| where other people are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23402)|
| 6:30:04| But when I'm outside, I don't wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23404)|
| 6:30:06| I don't wanna smell the fresh air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23406)|
| 6:30:08| I wanna be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23408)|
| 6:30:09| And we've got people that are so frightened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23409)|
| 6:30:11| that they won't even get out of their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23411)|
| 6:30:14| And why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23414)|
| 6:30:15| Even among the medical field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23415)|
| 6:30:18| no one can come to consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23418)|
| 6:30:20| on how this virus really does spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23420)|
| 6:30:24| And now we've got one that's supposed to be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23424)|
| 6:30:25| out of the UK, but even supposed to be more contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23425)|
| 6:30:30| We don't know if it's passed through the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23430)|
| 6:30:31| if it's passed through the touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23431)|
| 6:30:33| We don't know if it's heavier than air or lighter than air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23433)|
| 6:30:36| I'm not a scientist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23436)|
| 6:30:38| but I try to listen to everything that everybody says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23438)|
| 6:30:42| And to me, the things that bother me the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23442)|
| 6:30:47| is when I hear that children are being bothered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23447)|
| 6:30:50| that they're having mental health problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23450)|
| 6:30:53| and the suicide rate in some of the teenagers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23453)|
| 6:30:56| is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23456)|
| 6:30:57| That bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23457)|
| 6:31:02| And my oldest granddaughter graduated last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23462)|
| 6:31:06| without a graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23466)|
| 6:31:10| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23470)|
| 6:31:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23471)|
| 6:31:12| And they're supposed to be the least affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23472)|
| 6:31:16| So I know how I'm going to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23476)|
| 6:31:18| And I know one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23478)|
| 6:31:20| a non-elected board should not create law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23480)|
| 6:31:26| The non-elected board that was appointed by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23486)|
| 6:31:31| should not go and end around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23491)|
| 6:31:32| If they were wanting more control in other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23492)|
| 6:31:35| shouldn't they have come back to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23495)|
| 6:31:37| that constituted them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23497)|
| 6:31:41| Shouldn't they have come back to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23501)|
| 6:31:43| or did they go around us and go beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23503)|
| 6:31:46| what they're supposed to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23506)|
| 6:31:48| So, hey, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23508)|
| 6:31:52| I know one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23512)|
| 6:31:55| Sometimes I feel sorry for Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23515)|
| 6:31:58| because sometimes the board goes around her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23518)|
| 6:32:01| and sometimes they don't trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23521)|
| 6:32:04| Well, I trust her in what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23524)|
| 6:32:06| I do not trust the board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23526)|
| 6:32:09| And that's a hard thing to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23529)|
| 6:32:11| when it was convened by us as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23531)|
| 6:32:17| And when you lose confidence in the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23537)|
| 6:32:19| that you committed by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23539)|
| 6:32:23| then that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23543)|
| 6:32:24| And when the community starts losing confidence in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23544)|
| 6:32:28| that's a problem too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23548)|
| 6:32:31| And sometimes we're going to have to just bite the bullet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23551)|
| 6:32:34| and all of us look at each other and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23554)|
| 6:32:36| we're going to follow these five rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23556)|
| 6:32:38| We're going to stay socially distanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23558)|
| 6:32:40| We're going to wash our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23560)|
| 6:32:41| We're going to clean the countertops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23561)|
| 6:32:43| And we're going to make this go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23563)|
| 6:32:47| And I don't know how we're going to get the people together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23567)|
| 6:32:49| to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23569)|
| 6:32:50| but it's the people that will cure this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23570)|
| 6:32:53| because they should take the advice of what's given to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23573)|
| 6:32:57| but they're not going to do it now from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23577)|
| 6:33:00| So I know how I'm going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23580)|
| 6:33:02| And I just wanted to make my thoughts known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23582)|
| 6:33:06| that I do appreciate what Martha Buchanan does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23586)|
| 6:33:10| We don't always see eye to eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23590)|
| 6:33:12| but I do have confidence in her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23592)|
| 6:33:17| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23597)|
| 6:33:19| Thank you, Commissioner Buster, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23599)|
| 6:33:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23601)|
| 6:33:22| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23602)|
| 6:33:24| I will try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23604)|
| 6:33:27| A couple of comments about our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23607)|
| 6:33:29| The gentleman that was so eloquent was Connor Coffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23609)|
