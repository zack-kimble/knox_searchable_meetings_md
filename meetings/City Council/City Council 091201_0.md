| 0:01:27| and desires and that of their families that we may continue to experience that freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=87)|

| 0:01:56| but the best decisions for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=116)|

| 0:03:23| And consent items are 11 M as in mother through O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| I'm going to ask if we could consider adding items 11 D, E, and F to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| They are all resolutions where the city is helping out first the town of Teleco Plains, second Harriman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| and third Cookville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| They do not involve any city funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| We are merely assisting them in obtaining federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Motion a second to add 11 D, E, and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| We have no problem with that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Mr. Swanson, is that a legitimate motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| I think it's a consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| So the motion is to add 11 D, E, and F to consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| Anything further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| They were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| So now the consent items are 11 D, E, F, M, N, and O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Is there a motion to approve all of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| I'm not sure it's a typo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| but on the agenda summary sheet under the second item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| it says this individual was an employee of the former Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| We still do have a police department, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| We still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| He's a former employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| That typo notwithstanding, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=297)|

| 0:08:27| If you are unable to attend the city Christmas parade this Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| for the Fountain City Christmas tree lighting out at Fountain City Lake there near Hotel Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| and Broadway, actually one street south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Friday, this Friday, December 4th, the Kandora Arts and Heritage Center is going to have an open house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| from 5 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| That coincides, I guess, with first Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| And then, Councilman Frost, you didn't mention the Old North Knoxville Holiday Home Tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| So I'll fill in for you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| I'll cover your back on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| That is Saturday from 4 to 9 and Sunday from 12 to 30 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=549)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Well, I'll just say if you can't make it to Fountain City to see the tree light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| there will be a tree lighting Monday evening, the 7th, and it will be in the West Hills Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| So we would invite anyone who would love to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Any children who would love to see Santa can come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| I think he's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I think we're done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| We'll move on to item number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| 8A is a resolution appointing Councilman Joe Holquist to continue his service to the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| as co-chair of the Committee on Transportation and Mobility, requested by Councilmember Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| No disrespect meant to Councilman Holquist, but I personally don't like the fact that people that are leaving office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| who are appointing to these positions in a position that doesn't have an expiration, a term that expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=613)|
| 0:10:23| And I'm sure that probably there's, of the new members that are coming on to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| there may be somebody that would be interested in one of these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| So I think this appointment's a little premature, and I'd like to make a motion we postpone it for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| I guess I wanted to ask the committee chairs, was this discussed by the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=646)|
| 0:10:55| Was this something, I mean, what Councilman Hall's bringing up is who should be the leadership of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| And my question for you all is, is this something that the committee itself has talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| The answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Is the committee scheduled to meet soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| There's nothing scheduled because of the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| There probably could be if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| So I'm wondering, Mr. Hall, you postpone it for 12 weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| There was a reason behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| That would give the new council members enough time to orientate yourself that one of those may decide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| you know, I would really like to do that, and we're shutting the door now before they actually have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| to voice an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| And does 12 weeks give it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Because I think it's also valuable for the committee itself to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| And in a lot of ways, I think what Mr. Hall is getting at is the value of having a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| two council people leading the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Well, one of these committees, the next one is not two council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| And I understand the importance of institutional knowledge by being involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| but if you take that on to its extreme, Councilman Pelow knows the second district much better than anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=718)|
| 0:12:07| Or Rob Frost or whoever knows their perspective differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| but we don't keep them on in the positions of leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Now, Councilman Holquist could, I'm sure, go and participate in all these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| And I guess just to ask, my assumption, Mr. Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| is that you would have to be laid up and almost dead to miss a committee meeting like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| because this is something you care deeply about, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| The background on this, I asked Mr. Swanson, I said, well, you know, where does this put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| And he came up with resolutions to just, I guess he thought that may be a way of clarifying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| And I thought, let's just put it out here and see, start the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| You know, it's not necessarily this is the best way of dealing with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| but I certainly want to continue to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| I want to see the committee move forward and how we deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| I just didn't want to get in a position where the committee didn't have leadership even on an interim basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| But certainly open to anything, including what Councilman Hall is suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| Councilman Bailey, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Mr. Swanson, I don't know if you can recall offhand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| but I believe all these appointments are termed, three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| It's on a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Actually, the Committee on Transportation and Mobility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| I went back and reviewed the resolution that created that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| and really there is no specific term to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| And so the ad hoc committee will remain in place as long as the council determines the need exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| And there is no real term with regard to the persons involved in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| Well, that's probably a little oversight on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| because most of the ad hoc committees I've been involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| we definitely have had terms attached and they're on a rotating basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| So that council members all have a chance to appoint different people and rotate on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| But I'll say this, that this committee, the idea really came from Councilman Hulk was to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=846)|
| 0:14:15| Vice Mayor Brown just said has a lot of – cares deeply about these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| and he's the real leader of this committee and he's a valuable resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| As you've heard here on council, he brings a lot of knowledge on a number of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| but his background in transportation and the way he goes about it and studies it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| and what he brings to this committee is probably what the committee is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Having said that, I believe in these ad hoc committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| I think they're a valuable source of information to the council and to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| and they're doing a lot of good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| And, you know, I'd like to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| if Councilman Hulkwist isn't the co-chairman, who wants to take the leadership role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| I'm not opposed to postponing it by any means, but I can tell you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| he's the backbone behind this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| And without him, I don't know where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Well, at this point, unless we've had –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| there are probably new council members that are about to take office in a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| that probably don't even know this committee even exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| So there could be – I know when I got on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| there were a lot of committees and boards and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| I didn't have any idea they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| And so I think we could be shortchanging somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| and whether Councilman Hulkwist's involvement in the committee is, to me, is not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=944)|
| 0:15:53| It's just the leadership roles of those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| And not so much this one as the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Councilman Hulkwist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Well, also I would say that seeing this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| it seemed the only way it made sense is if Councilman Bailey was co-chairing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| and never saw it as indeterminate either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Just wanted to throw those things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Something we could do or not do on an interim basis or for as long as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| Well, you know, I can see some of these other appointments that we as council members make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| as we're going off council, making some appointments last minute, last couple of council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| But I think this is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| And I'll go along with whatever the council wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| but I'm not in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| I'm in favor of Councilman Hulkwist remaining as a co-chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Let me ask Councilman Bailey this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| I mean, from what I was hearing was you wouldn't be opposed to putting this on the agenda yourself, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1016)|
| 0:17:06| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| So?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| I probably should have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| It just happens to be Councilman Hulkwist's name on it, not yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Now, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| I guess Mr. Hall is proposing a 12-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| My sense is that currently Mr. Hulkwist is the co-chair and will remain as the co-chair until such time as we take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| So am I correct in that, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| I think, really, this resolution provides clarification to that issue because, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| there's nothing in the original creating resolution that necessarily says a co-chair has to be a member of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1065)|
| 0:17:55| It does name the co-chairs as members of City Council, but that does not qualify their chairmanship upon that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| So I would say that this is more clarifying in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| I guess I'm glad to hear that because in a lot of ways I agree with Mr. Bailey about the value Mr. Hulkwist has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| been to the committee and really been the moving force behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| And I kind of like Mr. Hall's idea of let's see if there's somebody else who wants to step up and take additional leadership on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| So my tendency is to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| The motion on the floor is to postpone for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| And I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| It will be postponed for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| 8B is a resolution appointing Council Member Joe Hulkwist to continue his service to the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and Knox County as co-chair of the Joint City-County Task Force on Ridge Slope and Hillside Development and Protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| requested by Council Member Hulkwist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| I don't know if I need to even make a motion to approve because it sounds like maybe we need to go in another direction on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Well, I was going to pretty much say the same thing I said on the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| And this one, whether Council Member Hulkwist is a driving force behind it or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| But I do know it is co-chair between him and a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| And in my opinion, this is a very important thing that we need somebody that's in a position of accountability to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1171)|
| 0:19:40| not just counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| And so I have the same opposition to it and would propose that it be postponed for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1183)|
| 0:19:53| Moved and seconded to postpone for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| I guess I understand, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| This one feels a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Mr. Hulkwist, my understanding of this is that this is a committee that has a very definite end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| not necessarily on a calendar but in a product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| And I guess my question related to this is what's the timeline looking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Because I would hate to be coming into the homestretch on this committee and change jockeys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| So where are we on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Well, we don't have an exact wrap-up date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| The key staff person, the NPC that was working on it had some illness and had to go through surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| And I think she's really recovering very, very well now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| So it looks like we're going to be able to move forward without that, without her having problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| But it's going to take us into the new year at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| I don't think there's any question before the task force can finish its work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| Final drafts of proposed ordinances and all that and proposed subdivision reg amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| and the public talking about one big public meeting this time instead of a series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| So I don't know exactly, but it could put us into February or even March maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| I just don't know exactly, but I can't imagine it going much longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| Ms. Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Well, this may be a bit redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| You didn't exactly comment on this in this manner, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| But, you know, the public process is really important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| And after having attended, I only was able to attend one of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| You know, I feel a sense of real need and importance of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| And along with that goes public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| So, personally, I don't see this having quite a short schedule for completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| because when you consider the public process and the opportunity for people to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| and then the final document to be prepared, I think that's a point that we need to consider as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1314)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| You know, given Ms. Peel might be right about when it's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| but if this is being finished in March, I don't see a need to change the germanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| So I think I'm going to oppose the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| The motion on the floor is to postpone for 12 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| We better do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1350)|

| 0:22:32| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| The motion fails four to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| So now we're back to actually there's no motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| So move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1377)|

| 0:23:01| I heard just one no from Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Motion passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1384)|

| 0:23:24| Thompson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I don't think he needs to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I think everybody knows him, but he did come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| You know, Mr. It might be Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Can you just stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Because I know there were some of the newly elected members here, and I don't know if they still are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1412)|

| 0:25:30| working, pressing us to work on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1530)|

| 0:26:44| Requested by Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1604)|

| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| I know there's some people signed up to make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| First, I would like to make a general comment that I greatly appreciate KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| I tried to contact them before this came on the agenda and speaking with, I've had numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| extensive conversations with Bill Elmore and though we might not agree in all aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| I do want to publicly thank him for being willing to talk about the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| As I told Mr. Elmore on the phone, KUB does many things very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| Unfortunately, we as a city hear about the things that haven't worked out so well and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1643)|
| 0:27:33| some of the mistakes that have occurred last for years if not decades because of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| happened to some of these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| The purpose of this is really to try to minimize and help KUB where we don't get many, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1662)|
| 0:27:51| of these situations in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Mr. Elmore for KUB has mentioned some possible, he calls them amendments, I don't mind calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| them additions, but there are people here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| I think I'll be quiet for now to let people say their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| The first speaker to sign up to speak in favor is Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Larry, if you'd give us your name and address and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| I'm speaking in support of Resolution 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Knoxville has a serious problem that must be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| This resolution is a first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Knoxville's public officials must tell KUB directly and unambiguously that the status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| quo regarding tree trimming is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| KUB's excessive tree trimming policies must be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| We are all disgusted at seeing so many needlessly butchered trees on private property and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| Knoxville's parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| We object to widespread clear cutting of all small diameter trees at the rate of thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I have been working with many neighborhood associations on this issue for the past three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| On May 8, 2007, City Council unanimously passed a resolution with the purpose of sending a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| message to KUB's management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| The title was, a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville requesting and encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| appropriate officials at KUB to carefully monitor and aggressively enforce tree trimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| policies designed to cut as few trees as possible and when trimming is required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| trim as little as reasonably feasible in order to maintain power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| It also stated, whereas City Council would urge the appropriate officials at KUB to heighten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| their level of sensitivity to the serious negative impacts which may result to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| from excessive trimming and cutting of trees as well as from trimming trees in such a fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| that the trees are made unnecessarily unbalanced or ugly by the trimming process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| City Council is of the opinion that more needs to be done to effectively monitor and enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| policies designed to protect these special natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| I'm here tonight because KUB has consistently ignored this resolution from the moment it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| was approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| KUB has become even more aggressive since 2007 in cutting and removing trees entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| I am pleading with City Council and all public officials to send KUB a much stronger message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| KUB does not care what I or Neighborhood Association leaders or its ratepayers think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| However, KUB may eventually care what you and Knox County Commission thinks if it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| made clear to them that KUB's policies must change or else steps will be taken to force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| KUB by ordinance, if necessary, to change its policies and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| KUB may care if City Council starts to take a real oversight role in reviewing how KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| is managing itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| If necessary, the City's charter can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| KUB will tell you that they must do what they do to prevent power outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Do not believe everything they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Believe what their own statistics say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Trees in the trim zone cause a very small percentage of the many thousands of outages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Most tree-related outages are caused by whole trees being uprooted and falling down, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| of which are outside the trim zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Over $5 million per year is spent removing branches and non-threatening trees to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| very few outages, while at the same time destroying thousands of trees and diminishing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Most outages are unpredictable and unpreventable, and squirrels caused more outages than trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| in the trim zone a few years ago, according to KUB's own statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| Do not believe KUB's false claims that they are required to follow guidelines of the National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Arbor Day Foundation or the Tree Line USA program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| There are no such guidelines that require trees to be cut in half or have their tops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| cut off or for ground-to-sky pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| In fact, these practices violate all standards for proper tree trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| These are merely KUB's current policies, not national utility standards or state or federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| I've been asked to read a brief statement by Mrs. Maria Comper, whom all of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| and respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| I'm sure she's watching on TV tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Mrs. Comper was unable to attend this meeting due to health reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Mrs. Comper, over many decades, has done more than anybody else in Knoxville for the beautification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| of our community by planting over a million daffodils and countless trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| She was instrumental in writing and getting enacted Knoxville's tree ordinance many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| ago and which now needs some tougher enforcement provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| She recently was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| To City Council, from Maria Comper, 7144 Cheshire Drive, I would like for KUB to stop destroying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| the aesthetic assets of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| It will take a long time, a great amount of effort and funding to repair the significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| damage that is being done by KUB to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| I support 100% the statement made by Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| In closing, I want to thank City Council for their consideration and particularly wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| to thank the outgoing members of City Council for their service and support of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| I have been assured by the five incoming Council members of their future support as we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| together to resolve this most serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| That's the only speaker we have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I appreciate so much Larry's efforts over the last few years in regard to the tree issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2025)|
| 0:33:54| And Larry is one of my constituents and I really respect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| I think, given an opportunity, Mr. Elmore may want to speak to how much Larry has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| to be able to bring about some sensitivity, which I believe was a part of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| passed in 2007, and consideration of the property owners regarding this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| And because we've had many conversations about how much significant change KUB has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2064)|
| 0:34:35| made in their policies since they became aware of many of the concerns of those of us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| Council and many of the issues that we have had to deal with in our neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| with property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| You know, there are a number of ways to go about bringing about change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| And because this was such a pressing issue in the Second District, Mr. Frost, you commented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| I knew a great deal about the Second District, I felt that it was really important for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| And I hope you don't mind me being personal about this, but I contacted KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| They were good enough to sit down with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| It was right after the 2007 resolution was considered and was approved and adopted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| And I thought that it had a tone of, that we were all looking to find ways to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2126)|
| 0:35:35| to understand and deal with the issues and to express the concerns to KUB that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2135)|
| 0:35:45| all receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| I thought that it was a very good resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I supported that and was happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Now, I have a lot of concern about what we're looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| And it was just something that we already discussed earlier and something that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| up continually last evening when we had a sharing session with the newly elected Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| members who are about to take their seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| We continued to comment on the importance of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| And I totally think that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| I had an e-mail this afternoon from someone who lives in my neighborhood who was supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| But at the end of the e-mail, he asked me a question, which I answered to tell him that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2192)|
| 0:36:41| there is a policy in place in which he had an opportunity to discuss his particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2201)|
| 0:36:49| issue with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| He e-mailed back that he wasn't aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| And how did he miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Well, he missed it because he doesn't have any trees that are going to be trimmed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| this schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| And so that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| But it was so interesting, the back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| I don't think everyone is aware of the new policies that KUB has put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| And they have been so beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| We have just been through a huge tree-cutting schedule, I guess you would say, in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| And I have to tell you that I've had calls and I've had questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| But I have had people who were so appreciative of the opportunity to discuss the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| that are theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| If they take the opportunity to meet with KUB, I would like for Mr. Elmore or someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| to express the changes that have taken place since our 2007 resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| And I would like for us to all consider the fact that we haven't had a public workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| We haven't had any discussion since 2007 to discuss how KUB is trying to remedy some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2282)|
| 0:38:12| the complaints, how they're trying to spend a great deal of time, and I'm sure money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| meeting with the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| They had to come to my house twice because we have not as much of a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| I wish we didn't have a tree at all, to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| But now, because it's got some bum scars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| But it's going to be out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| And we've made a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Bill will tell you that they've hired foresters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| They have actual professionals who are willing to come out to everyone's piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| if they request that assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| And for me, personally, I think, and I know Mr. Silverstein feels that not enough has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| And I don't know if enough can be done when those of us have planted trees too close to the property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| So I know I'm rambling, but I'm trying to say that I really think that we're rushing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2347)|
| 0:39:16| I realize that some of us are going to be gone and won't be the decision makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| But I would like to see a good public education process where both KUB can hear from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| but this council can hear from them about the rationale behind the manner in which the trees are cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2370)|
| 0:39:39| So if you all would permit me, I'd like to ask Mr. Elmore if he would like to comment for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2379)|
| 0:39:52| If you'd give us your name and address, please, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| I'm Bill Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I live at 1848 Stonebrook Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| And I do appreciate the opportunity to talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| We were here three years or so ago when the first resolution was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| It is something that KUB continually tries to communicate with our customers on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| We try to be as proactive as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| We try to accept whatever comments and concerns the customers are willing to share with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| and criticisms and find ways to address those to make our program stronger and better and more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| It is something that's very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| It's very important, we think, to our customers in that it is critical to the safety and reliability of our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| And that's very important to all of our customers, those who are residential customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| those who are commercial customers, those who work at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| those who have health care issues and rely upon medical equipment in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| Reliability is a major, major concern to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| And we want to do everything we can to ensure that reliability on a continuing and ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| We have talked with Mr. Silverstein over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| We've had a number of meetings with him, some of those in the field with our foresters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| some of those in our offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| We've talked about this in a lot of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| And we have made a lot of improvements, many of them arising directly or indirectly from comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| and concerns and questions that he has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| We have increased the ways in which we communicate with our customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| the number of customer contacts that we make and the way we make those contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| We now have an ongoing process where customers are contacted well in advance of the pruning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| and then again immediately before the pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| We will have our foresters, if a customer wishes, to meet with them on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| and talk about the trimming that's to occur on a tree-by-tree basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| If necessary, we'll have that forester be there during the trimming process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| with the customer and schedule that 24 hours in advance so that the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and the forester can be there and basically direct that trimming on a limb-by-limb basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| We do not obviously go into a neighborhood without notifying those customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| We try to take advantage of neighborhood meetings in advance of the trimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| or in some cases schedule specific neighborhood meetings just for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| We've had a number of those kinds of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| All of it to try to communicate to our customers the process that's available to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| how they can request assistance, how they can request or appeal, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2558)|
| 0:42:46| the decision that's being made on the trimming of their tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| and how we can go about trying to find a resolution that's in their best interest and ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| and still provides the reliability and safety that we need on our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| So it is an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| We appreciate the kinds of input we've gotten from this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| from Mr. Silverstein and others in the community who have voiced and expressed concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| and continue to do so from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| The truth of the matter is, as we go into a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| and perform this trimming work and use the lateral pruning method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| which is required of us to be a Treeline USA utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| every time you go in there and do the trimming, you're trimming less and less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| because that process not only supports the health of the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| but it helps train that tree to grow away from the power lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| so that the next time you come through there, the trimming will not be as excessive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| or will not be as needed as much as it was the previous trim cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| So every cycle results in less trimming because of the use of that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| and the effects it has on the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| and the trimming impact is less each time we go into a neighborhood because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| So again, we appreciate council's views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| We are anxious to do what we can to support the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| We're more than willing to consider options to our current trimming methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| If there are concerns that arise from our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| I think those issues arise on various levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| In some respects, it's maybe about how we communicate to our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| Although we've increased the way we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| and we're using the web and mail and face-to-face visits, maybe there's a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| Maybe the community can suggest ways it would work better for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| If the issue is the lateral pruning method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and our customers as a whole no longer care or no longer wish for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| to be a TreeLineUSA utility to go along with the city's TreeUSA designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| then that's something we can consider as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| But all these things have to be looked at and viewed on a broad scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| in terms not only of aesthetics, but the safety and reliability of our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| and our customers and how we can best achieve those standards and those needed benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| and at the same time try to more in a more appropriate manner address the customer's issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| of aesthetics and how those trees look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| It is not an easy task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| You are trying to do two things that are not necessarily complementary of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| But the trimming has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Some method has to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| If not the method we're using today, then some other method that may or may not serve the tree health as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| but may be more acceptable to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| And if that's the case, we're willing to consider those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| I'm sorry, Ms. Peebles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| I was just hoping that Mr. Elmore would make the comments regarding the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| because I think that's one thing that's important for people to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| what options are theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I'm not sure we all realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| May he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| I think he missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| I was hoping that he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| We try our best to be consistent in terms of what we do in trimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| and that is to use the Treeline USA standards of lateral pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| If a customer does not want that to occur on their tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| they do have an option to perform the trimming themselves at their expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| The other option, though, is in terms of how we deal with the customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| even when we're going to use the lateral pruning method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| if we're dealing with a slow growth tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| a species that doesn't grow as fast as some others might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| and if we're on a three-year trim cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| we can sometimes modify that 10 feet of clearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| minimum 10 foot of clearance that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| to address that slower-growing species of tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| So we have some options as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| but the customers also have an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| One of the things also that gets a lot of concern and criticism at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| is how a tree will look after we've trimmed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| And there's not a lot of options if that tree is up close to the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| To get that 10 feet of clearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| you do have to leave a tree that's pretty one-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And if that is unsightly to the customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| if the customer would rather that tree be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| KUB will offer the option of tree removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| and in some cases, depending upon the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| tree replacement, preferably at another location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| so that we don't have to repeat this process again at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| So there are options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you. Sorry, now Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| One thing, in part, I was saying nice things about KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| They came up with some language that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| I don't know if members of City Council were forwarded this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| Okay, Mr. Elmore was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Briefly, they were wanting to have language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| where City Council would create a tree trim policy review panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| meetings would be open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| and would be charged in performing a comprehensive review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| of KUB's vegetation management program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| including the safety and reliability of the electric system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| tree trimming methods and standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| customer communications, contractor management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| conflict resolution procedures, and the impacts on tree health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| and neighborhood aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| They would have, their terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| not more than 15 individuals on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| Two would be representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| One would be from the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Remaining members would represent a diversity of experience and opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| including, for example, professional arborists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| various neighborhood representatives, tree and or landscape experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| business and industry representatives, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| UT and or state forestry representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| and a representative of the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| We don't have a motion on the floor, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| If someone will indulge me with a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| I'll move to amend to add that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I'll move to amend to add that language to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| Do we have a motion at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| He just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| It was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| I'll make the motion to add that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I'm sorry, Mr. Becker, to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| He's going to second the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I think that's what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I think we're still good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| I was talking to Mr. Elmore today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| and then we started talking about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| It took me for a while to remember of Gladys Kirshner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| out on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Remember I said earlier, we hear about the bad things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| and we and KUB are trying to minimize, if not eliminate, the bad things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| Mrs. Kirshner is 81 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Unfortunately, one of KUB's contractors came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| to do some trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| There was a different tree that was marked for trimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| and she actually went out and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| hang on, wrong tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| It's actually on a different piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| the neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Unfortunately, the KUB contractor didn't give her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| the time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Ultimately, KUB was good enough to compensate her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| to the tune of almost $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| Tree's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| KUB's paid about $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| But if you think about it, the KUB gets their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| from the rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| That's those people in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| those people watching this on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| So they helped out, but unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| you can't make somebody whole in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Just looking at people sitting out here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| we've heard from this fellow named Nick DellaVope before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| about his personal experience in Holston Hills recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| In the past, I heard from Kim Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| who's sitting out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| who resides in Old North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| has also served on the tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| I'm sure she weighed in on this subject in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| What Mr. Elmore is suggesting and what I'm suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| and hopefully folks will agree upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| is a parallel path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| KUB will be doing the community group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| that they seek to do, to study this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| But at the same time, on that parallel path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| there'll be a group of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| that can look at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| The analysis I have given Mr. Elmore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| is that KUB might come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| well, we need scenario A to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| The constituent consumer, the rate payer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| comes in and says, I want scenario C to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| And my hope is that they will be able to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| with a solution that everyone can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| It might be scenario B, where if KUB and the rate payer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| are sitting together in the same room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| and being heard at, being heard by, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| people who are open-minded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| willing to consider both sides of the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| that the consumer and also KUB might be able to come away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| and say, hey, I've been listened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| and I feel like I've had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| to state my position and now I better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| where we can meet part way and come away happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| or as happy as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| And that would go for both the rate payer and KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| We need to, I think it helps facilitate a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| I've talked to Mr. Elmore about the number of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| that make it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Apparently he catches all the really, really bad complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| Sometimes there are none and it can go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| for a period of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| and sometimes there might be as many as six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| That's why I've made the amendment to the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| to see if we can move forward together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| where we can both assist KUB and assist the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| and thirdly, assist the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| who KUB are getting ready to pay a visit to next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| simply because while the process of the KUB committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| and I don't know if that's the right nomenclature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| KUB committee, is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| trees are still going to be continued to be cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| for the management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| So hopefully we can move on parallel paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| and try to help out as many people as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| and that's why I appreciate KUB's suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| I wanted to ask Bill, Mr. Elmore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| when you speak of the designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| of being a Treeline USA utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| that sounds good and I don't mean that in a negative way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| but what value or benefit does that bring to KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| to the rate payers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| To the rate payers, I think the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| is not necessarily being named the utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| the Treeline USA utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| and getting a plaque for the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| I think it is a recognition that our pruning standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| are those standards adopted by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| or recommended by the National Arbor Day Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| which are intended to protect the tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| and to promote the tree's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| So it's a recognition that we're not out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| indiscriminately trimming to achieve our goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| and our benefits without some concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| and an approach that would attempt to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| protect the tree and the tree health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| and the tree's well-being in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| What do you think about this independent appeals board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| What's KUB think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| My concern, and I've shared that with Councilman Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| over the last several days in discussions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| I don't know that it's, I think it's premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| I think it is a logical, perhaps second step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| that might be necessary but might best be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| after you go through this review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| because my concern is that unless or until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| you've gone through the review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| and had this panel of representative customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| bringing a diverse amount of perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| and views to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| and has looked at our standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| looked at our processes, our procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| the mechanisms that are in place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| to resolve customer complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| and looked at all of this in a very comprehensive manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| even to the point of looking at what other utilities are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| in the area, in the southeast, in Tennessee, wherever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| I don't think until you've done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| you can really effectively utilize an appeals board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| because I don't know on what basis the appeals board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| will be making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| In theory, they are making their decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| on the basis of is KUB adhering to the procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| to the standards that have been adopted and are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| And if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| then they're hearing us make that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| make that assertion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| On the other hand, the appellant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| the customer who's appealing to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| is probably saying I don't like the looks of the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| I don't like what it's going to look like when you're through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| So you've got a board trying to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| on the basis of aesthetics versus safety and reliability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| and meeting the standards that have been adopted by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| My feelings and those of KUB are that it would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| to have this review panel review and make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| on what the appropriate community standards might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| And those might involve changes to the lateral pruning method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| giving up, if appropriate, the Treeline USA status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| It might involve backing away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| from what's called the blue sky trimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| and lessening the standard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Once those new standards can be established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| if there's a need for an appeals board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| then I think that can still be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| That might, at some point, be one of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| that this group would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Or, if it's not, if council wishes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| you have the prerogative at any point in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| to bring it back up as something you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| might be appropriate in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| But I think it's important, from the way we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| to take this first step in a very comprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| thorough manner and then decide where to go from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| with our program, with our standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| with our existing appeal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| because, frankly, we don't get that many customer refusals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| in terms of tree trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| We get, on average, about one refusal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| for every 15 and a half miles we trim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| That's based on the last 17 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| So that's not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| But when we do get them, we sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| we have a process internally to review those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| to deal with them, to resolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| In some cases, everybody walks away happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| In other cases, neither we nor the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| are completely happy with the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| but it's resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| You know, the KUB ratepayers and the city taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| are one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| So when they become upset, lots of times we hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| And, of course, we've relayed some of those complaints to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| One of my fears is that people in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| you know, they fear the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| They fear the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| They fear KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| They don't think they have much choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| They're afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| You know, you never know who's at home, who's away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| You know, it's a delicate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| And so I'm always trying to figure out a way to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| those that may not feel they have a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| or cannot communicate how they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| And, you know, as you said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| it's a very delicate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| It's people's trees that they planted and bushes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| that they had in their yard all along or on their street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| and in their city in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| And there is a disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| And, you know, there needs to be..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| We need to find a way to improve not only the communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| but also the look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| And, you know, I guess you say you're pruning towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| you know, for better health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| And I know you've seen some of these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| They don't look very good after it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| We have never said that some of these trees don't look ugly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| when we're through with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| And the closer they are to the power lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| the nearer they are or the more centered they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| under the lines, the uglier they're going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| And so..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| And I might try to go out with one of your crews personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| and just follow the process because I know three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| years ago when they came down my street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| you know, I'm sure it's changed for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Well, I'm glad that, you know, you've recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| I'm glad that the review panel and Councilman Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| has another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| So, I'll just listen and see where we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Vice Mayor, I think your light was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Mr. Frost, I have some questions about how we've amended this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| what it says and what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Are we doing something where we've just added the amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| So, we're actually saying we want you to establish a review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| award and establish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Some questions about who's on the advisory committee and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Before you answer, I'm wondering if it makes sense to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| this for two weeks, get a clean copy and pick up the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| And I'll..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Honestly, in an e-mail from Mr. Elmore today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| they indicated that they were going to distribute this to city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| And so, I came in under the..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Maybe I misread the e-mail or maybe I assumed something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| wasn't..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I'm not..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| It was, like I said, you know, I read verbatim what KUB actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Was it distributed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Did we miss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| And I guess my question as the maker of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| you were, and I was the seconder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| I like the language they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| And I guess my question for you is what is on the table right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| now, both establishing a review board and a study committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| I don't know if I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| But I needed to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| One thing I think we do need to realize is that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| limitations to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I mean, there's limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| There's some things that council can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| wants to do, doesn't have the force of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| I think this is one of these times where these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| I also think that, yes, I understand that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| sometimes there's reluctance to outside people watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I remember many years ago police advisory review committee was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| being proposed and the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| some members took exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| I think it has been an unequivocal success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| I think the police department would agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| that it has been an unequivocal success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| I see this as, in some regards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| a parallel situation to allow people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| not necessarily with KEB, to get involved with the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| to look at the situation and to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| you know, do we have best practices situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| And I guess just to, I guess the question is about having both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| the appeal and the study committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Again, running it parallel to the park sort of says we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| going to study what the police policies ought to be at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| time we're going to have a review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| And my concern would be what Ms. Drummore said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| How is the review board or the appeals board going to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| what's right or wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| And that sort of gets to be a question I'm not quite clear on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| before I heard that and it's why I liked it so much and wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| to quickly second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| I was thinking along those lines because it almost feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| with the appeal process what you're doing is you're setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| policy in bunches of small things and what we need to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| what the review is, which is set the policy at the level that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| policy that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| So I'm wondering and I'll let you respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| but eventually I'm going to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| make an amendment to pull out the appeal process out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| But let me go ahead and let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Well, I think you need the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| taking KUB's suggestion to put in the board to have it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| parallel path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Their KUB crews are out right now cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| They're, you know, doing their business in different parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| the city and it would be, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| if you're going to create a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| and I certainly understand KUB can't stop right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| They have contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| They have obligations to fulfill and I certainly respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| But, you know, if you have nothing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| there is no time frame for this committee to complete its task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| Is it going to be a six weeks committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| a six month committee, a year committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| While all this is going on and people who would like to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| you know, somebody that's not inside KUB make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| they can't have them make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| When I was talking to Mr. We were talking at 10 o'clock last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| night and I reckon it kind of drew a parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| When an attorney goes into a court of appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| they're arguing in, you know, some cases in front of five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| That's why we're proposing five people on this appellate body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| Each side is to advocate but also educate the people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| making the decision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| And that's in part why, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| suggesting one member of KUB be on this because they will bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| to the table the knowledge of that type of aspect of KUB's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| vegetation management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| That's why I also suggested someone from Parks and Rec or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Greenways or Public Service Department who can bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| their knowledge but also someone who is a consumer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| representative to someone that are consumer representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| So that was the basis for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Did I answer questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| I've got more but..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Mr. Elmore, if I understood you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| you said that you contact the customer before the trimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| So you enter into a dialogue with the customer and if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| tree is right underneath the power line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| they do have the option of having the entire tree taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| And have another tree replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| In many cases, there is an option for a replacement tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| a smaller, more ornamental tree and planted at the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Not in every case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| In virtually every case, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Now when you refer to the customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| are you referring to the person within the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| the building or the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| It would be the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| So like, for example, when I went down Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| I saw this, one of those trees where the center was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| scooped out right in front of a barber shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| It's very likely that the owner was called and given the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| of even of we'll do it or you can pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| And he probably said, oh, forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| You do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Let me correct myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| In making up that mailing list, I think it is probably not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| It is the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Whoever is getting the KUB bill at that address would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| individual who would receive the letter that goes to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| And they would be making the decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Well, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| We will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| If it's not their tree, we would ask for the customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| the property owner, to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| And the person at the property, like the barber in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| he would be notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| He or she would be notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| They would be part of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Now, there are letters that go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| There are door hangers that go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| There is information on our Web site as well on where our tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| crews are and where they're expected to be in the near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| So we're communicating on the Web with letters to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| customers at all those addresses on that circuit as well as with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| the door hangers that go through the neighborhood and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| employees putting something on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| And those are all encouraging anyone who has questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| concerns to call us or contact us through an e-mail address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| In other circuits where it is a dense residential circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| we do what we call pre-planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| And in those cases, before we ever do the trimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| our foresters will go out and evaluate each tree to be trimmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4147)|
| 1:09:15| and mark the tree in the field so that the customer then can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| tell from the markings whether their tree is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| impacted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| And that's another opportunity for them to contact KUV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| have our forester come out face-to-face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| talk through the trimming process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| and express any concerns that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| I think Councilman Hall and then Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| Mr. Elmore, and you may have said this and I didn't pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| on it, but we were talking about these trees at one point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| look lopsided, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| where they've cut all the limbs off one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| And I think you said that the customers had the option of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| having that tree removed at no expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Now, what if, and this was a question that came to me from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| one of my constituents, what if they had wanted to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| other side trimmed, too, so it would look symmetrical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| Will you all do that at no cost to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| No, sir, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| We will not go to the added expense of shaping the tree or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| pruning it so that it has whatever appearance that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| be more acceptable to the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| We're trimming with our crews only for the safety and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| reliability standards that we're trying to achieve and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| not go beyond that in trying to shape or make it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| Mr. Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| I was going back to what Councilman Frost said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| He pointed out that this does not have any force or effect of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| You know, it doesn't force KUB to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| It's just expressing the will or intent or desire, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I'm wondering if we left it as amended where it created the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| Tree Trim Policy Review Panel that you had suggested with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| the components and issues being addressed that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| At the same time, left in Councilman Frost's language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| about the appeal board, that would not correct me if you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| this differently, but the way I see it, KUB could consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| advisory could begin by establishing the Tree Trim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| Policy Review Panel, but know that council wanted KUB to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| seriously look at or move towards a review board unless it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| could make a case otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| But it wouldn't necessarily have to establish that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| It would have to respond in some way to council's desire that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| create the board through the panel, through whatever efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| KUB made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| So, I guess where I'm headed with this is, would you agree or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| disagree that if the language were left the same, KUB could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| respond in the way I've described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| So, you could come back, send a letter to council members saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| okay, this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| We're going to set up this advisory or this Tree Trim Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Review Panel first, and we're going to take under advisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| council's, amongst all the other issues that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| addressing, council's desire that we consider establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| this policy, this appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| And we're going to be really serious about this, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| going to start working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| And we are going to address this appeals board issue and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| back to council with a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| Is that something that you could do given the language that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| have here in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| I think you made the point very well, and certainly Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Frost made it in discussions with me, that this is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| On the other hand, KUB and the KUB board take very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| any advice we get from city council, and we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| create the impression that we're treating it lightly or ignoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| it in any manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| From my perspective, what I would prefer would be that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| further amend the language not to include the creation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| appeals board, but to add that the Tree Trim Review Panel would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| include in its analysis the possibility or the need for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| appeals board, such that that would basically be part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| scope of the undertaking that this panel would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| And it would be something not that they would necessarily be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| left to come up with on their own, but would specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| after taking into consideration all of the other factors and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| of the other issues and any recommended changes or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| that they would also consider whether or not they felt like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| was appropriate to establish an independent appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| And if so, whether that was something that needed to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| now or whether at the end of their process review or whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| it was something that needed to be done after or considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| again after whatever changes were recommended and might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| made to the overall vegetation management program and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| standards associated with that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Well, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| And it certainly makes sense from your standpoint to prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| And I don't want to speak for Councilman Frost, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| want to speak for the people that I've received e-mails from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| advocating support for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| But I think that having, leaving the language in there could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| leave a certain amount of gravity or weight to it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| wouldn't necessarily be perceived to be there if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| language was changed just to state we request that you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| analyze the potential for an appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| That may seem like splitting hairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| I think some people might say we keep enough pressure on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| to say we really think this appeals board issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| And if KEB is going to come back and say we don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| going to work, it needs to be handled in such a way that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| response has the same amount of gravity and weight to it, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Ms. Pelham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Well, to sort of continue on that vein, what would the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| possibility of this be, there on line eight on the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| that's before us, or excuse me, the resolution that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| Whereas city council would further encourage KUB to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| consider creating an independent appeals board charged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| responsibility of providing meaningful review and so on, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| not specify its makeup, but just simply if this is going to be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4600)|
| 1:16:47| advisory or an encouragement that that be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| I really strongly agree with some comments Councilman Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| made earlier, or was leading to earlier, you know, if I were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| appointed to such an appeals board, I'd want to have policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| basic criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| I'd want to have something on which to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| And I do not see that we have that, and I think that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| would come out of the amendment which was offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| And I sort of think, to talk like an old country girl, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| got the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| So I want to be sure we have a horse, but, heck, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| horse is not much good without the cart, and the cart is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| absolutely worthless without the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So what are we going to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| We need to get the best information, the best education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| the very best communication out here in the community, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| this isn't about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| It's really about all of those rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| It's really about all the people who are having this experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| with their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| So I think that would give strong encouragement to KUB in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| consideration of what this Council is thinking, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| would not tie their hands to a five-member board or the makeup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| It just seems to me that the message would be there without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| specifics, which would tie them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| And someone made the comment, maybe it was you, Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Hollicus, that we don't have any time frame here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Well, you know, we set up a lot of committees and a lot of task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| forces that do have, they are expected to complete their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| within six months, whatever, three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| And so I think this Council can do that in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| amendment that's been offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| That's just some of my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Let me start by just saying to Mr. Elmore and I guess anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| else who's ever come into Council, if you're coming and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| you think, I don't need to make a copy of that piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| because of course they have it, make a copy of that piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| paper, because it's very frustrating when there's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| And let me say also, I'm glad Mr. Frost, you brought this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| because clearly it's a big issue and we need to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| The amended version of the resolution right now, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| includes both us recommending to KUB to establish a appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Does it also just say we're recommending to KUB that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| set up a committee to study their policies, or are we setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| up the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| KUB's own language creates KUB creating a tree trim policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4773)|
| 1:19:42| I mean, I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Well, it feels like, you know, it's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| The resolution right now kind of recommends to KUB they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| I kind of made a joke to somebody of, you know, maybe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| could recommend my son that he clean his room up, and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| know, it might have as much impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| And it would probably have more, because I think KUB cares more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| about this body than my son would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| But it feels like what we need to do is set up our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| committee to set up a policy on tree trimming here, that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| idea of saying, well, KUB ought to study its policies, and KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| ought to set up a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| We ought to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| I mean, we're the people that make the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| And so I guess I'm not actually going to amend anything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| I think maybe I ought to ask Mr. Swanson for the next meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| draw up something that creates a city task force to study tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| trimming policies under these and look at it towards setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| some policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| I don't pretend to know all the tasks, but we have a city tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| board already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| You know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| That could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| It seems to me that what we need to remember here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| ultimately we don't have jurisdiction over KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| We can make recommendations, but, you know, in terms of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| forming our own tree advisory committee to look at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| policy, to me, I think that's out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| And I'm comfortable with the language where it is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| because it is encouraging and suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| I know Mrs. Pilo expressed some concern about it being too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| confining for them, and I don't feel like the five, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| the five members that Councilman Frost has listed, but he says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| potentially including a representative of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| You know, if KUB decides to go down this line and they choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| to include seven members or nine members, you know, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Well, and I want to be sure that we aren't going to object if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| they make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| So, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| What I was trying to say is I think the language that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| here is flexible, it allows KUB some flexibility, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| pleased that they have come forward in the spirit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| cooperation and have said it's not just the appeals process we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| want to look at, to use the words of someone from KUB that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| spoke with today, we want to fly at 30,000 feet and look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| And that's very encouraging to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| You know, let's not just pick on the appeals process, but let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| look at everything that KUB is considering policy-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| including the Tree City USA designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| Let's bring in a variety of voices to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Let's make it a public process where the meetings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| sunshined, and any interested party, whether they are appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| to this process, this group, can attend, if they choose to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| and sit in and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| And, you know, to me, this is a real spirit of cooperation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| we made some strides, as Mrs. Pillow said, two years ago in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| 2007 that I think were significant, and I think it's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| to look at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| One of the things Mr. Elmar and I talked about today was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| special status tree program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| And that is a program that has been developed by KUB since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| 2007 process, but perhaps it has not been advertised or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| publicized as thoroughly as it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| And that is certainly a process where folks can engage when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| have, I like to call them heritage trees, but when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| have special status trees on their property, there's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| specific almost appeals process where folks can engage with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| but a lot of folks perhaps don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Mr. Elmar sent me today the series of mailings that an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| individual receives when their trees are to be trimmed, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| looking at that, there's probably some places where some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| more language can be added about the special status trees, KUB's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| flexibility in meeting with you at different times of day, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| ability to engage on the internet, you don't have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| in a phone queue forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| So I think we're moving in the right direction, it's just time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| to tweak it again, but we've got to make the recommendation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| we'd like to see KUB do that, and then let them work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| And then we can come back and say, you did a great job, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| did a lousy job, but we don't have jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| Mr. Elmar, I wonder if you'd explain KUB's rationale to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| You have a tree with limbs on the right side that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| interfering with the power lines, and you trim the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| What's the rationale for not doing the left side so that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| tree won't appear to be butchered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Well, first of all, we're trimming those trees only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| because we have the need to protect our trees, our power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| lines from those trees, and from the possibility that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| limbs are going to come into contact with those wires, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| doing so could create a power outage or could create the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| potential for electrocution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| So it's safety and reliability that drives our need to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| We don't feel like we can afford to go in and do a static| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| trimming, trimming beyond that which is required to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| standards and to provide the level of safety and reliability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| that we're trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| So from some, in one respect, it's about money and how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| additional cost our customers should bear for us to trim, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| just to ensure reliability and safety, but to create a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| aesthetic, more pleasing view, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| In some cases, when you've got an L-shaped trim that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| required because that tree is so close to the power lines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| you're basically going back almost to the trunk of that tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| on the side adjacent to the power lines, if you were trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| to achieve symmetry, about the only choice you would have would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| be to then go to the opposite side of the tree and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| everything off on that side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| So it would look more like a power pole by the time you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| finished than it would a tree, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| So in those kinds of cases, it almost makes more sense to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| remove the tree if the customer is willing to have that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| But in a lot of cases, the customers would rather have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| tree that's less than aesthetically pleasing than to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| lose the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| And so, in those cases, you know, if the customer doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| want the tree removed, we trim for safety and reliability, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| you end up with the misshapen tree that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| This makes for such bad public relations and such a bad image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| when somebody drives down the street and sees this kind of and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| all they can see is butchery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| It seems to me somebody needs to really think about that and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| what could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| I mean, I understand your explanation, but I believe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| can do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| You're suggesting to go beyond the trimming for reliability and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| safety and go toward the aesthetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Yes, I do, because this is what the complaint is all about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| This is exactly what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Butchered trees that people just think are unsightly, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| are unsightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Well, and that may be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| We've always said that, you know, in certain circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| the tree is not going to be pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| It's not going to be attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| My concern is that the more you trim, even though it's perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| going to be more symmetrical, it may even be more unsightly in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| the end, because trying to trim that tree, particularly a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| one close to the power lines, is going to end up in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| with basically topping the tree, which, again, is not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| recommended by the Arbor Day Foundation and is not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| best interest of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| But those are things that, again, I think this review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| panel can take under consideration, take under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| advisement, look at the potential positive and or negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| impacts on the customer of doing more extensive trimming and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| cost associated with that and the impact it has on KUB rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| All of those things I think are legitimate questions, legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| issues to put on the table for consideration and to get a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| overall picture of the impact, the cost, and the end result for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| our KUB and KUB rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Now, the people who actually do the work, how closely are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| monitored?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| The people who do the tree trimming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| Those crews are assigned to either one of the KUB inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| or one of our contract inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| They are trained and go through a process to make sure they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| understand what not only the national standards are that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| expect them to abide by, but what our standards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| After each trim cycle, all of their work is inspected again to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| make sure that they did the work that they were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| If there are issues that we identify or numerous customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| complaints that cause us to have concerns about that contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| or their performance, we have an evaluation process that can lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| up to and include their being released and no longer allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| work on our system, either for some period of time or for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| remainder of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| It would depend upon the seriousness of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| So we do inspect, we do police, and we do discipline, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| will, our contractors if it's necessary and when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| And we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Mr. Elmore, is KUB going to do this review panel no matter what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| Because you don't need us to tell you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I mean, you can do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| And quite frankly, we had not discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| The more we've talked about it, the more we've proposed it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| Councilman Frost, the more sense it makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| Because I think on the one hand, a lot of folks may be saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| a review board is necessary and that's what they would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| I think the bigger issue is not the review board because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| the bigger issue and the bigger concern is about the trimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| And what's the time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| What's the time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| We've heard that question come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| I think it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| First of all, we would want to take it back to our board that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| meets later this month for their input and approval and insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| But we are in the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| You go to our board the third week of this month, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| realistically it's going to be the first of the year before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| could get people named and committed and assigned and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| And after that, it's a matter of how often this group wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| meet, how much time they want to devote to it, and how thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| they want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| I mean, if they stop at just looking at KUB's procedures and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| policies and standards, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| If they want to broaden out and talk to folks and see what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| going on in Nashville or Chattanooga with the utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| there or in Birmingham or Asheville or wherever, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| that's going to take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| But that doesn't mean that necessarily their recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| or some of their recommendations couldn't be made on an interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| basis and that they couldn't provide us and you all with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| status reports as they go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| It's hard depending upon how deep they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| I would think surely in a three-month period, I'll put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| under the gun, but I would think, you know, by spring, early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| summer, late spring, early summer, that they could be in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| position to at least have some interim recommendations and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| talking about next steps as far as how much more in-depth do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| they want to go and how broad they want to cast the net in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| terms of looking at other standards and other utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| Maybe you could do it in phases because there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| people that are, you know, every day their trees are being cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| in their yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| And so the sooner you address some of these issues that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| been discussed tonight, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| And then if you went on to look at what's going on in different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| states and cities, that would be a good thing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| And I think also the point that's been made here tonight in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| the interim, maybe we do, maybe we redouble our efforts to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| sure that the customers understand that there is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| internal review process in place for them today and that all they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| need to do is exercise that right and we'll handle those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| reviews as we do internally, but just make them more aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| what's available to them and how we can handle that in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| interim as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Right now the motion on the floor is to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| Is it to amend and to include the appeal board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| Well, it would be to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Mr. Frost, since you made that, would you clarify the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| I would be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| It adds the review panel that KUB is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| Does that answer your question, Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Let me ask you this, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| You just heard Mr. Elmore say they're going to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Do we need this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| I think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| I've heard from a number of people, whether it's Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| Old North Knoxville, West Hills, Sequoia Hills, Holston Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| South Haven, that I think they would appreciate something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5619)|
| 1:33:46| that council has listened to their concerns, obviously had a very respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| yet vigorous debate on this topic, and we're responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5632)|
| 1:34:00| Mayor, I'm just going to say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| I appreciate Mr. Silverstein and his efforts in the community and on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| and I know Mr. Elmore, public service is a tough job and so forth and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| but I'm happy to see that KUB has heard the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| and is going to do the review panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and I don't think it's necessary for us with no authority at all just to say to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| The resolution itself is not worth a hill of beans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| And with the amendment, for me, it would make more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| You know, it ain't worth a hill of beans without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| Ms. Phelan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| Well, I would just echo that simply because it's been my feeling all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| we haven't had the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| And I think with that review panel, I think that there will be an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| and I think it needs to be sunshine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| and I think it needs to be treated like any other workshop type panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| or task force that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| And I really think there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| I really think there have been efforts to improve the process that people are not aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| and that really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| So I think this gives that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| Now, as Mr. Elmore said, he's heard us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| He knows what we feel is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| And I think they realize that it's to their advantage to be more in communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| not only with the specific property owners, but with the rate payers and property owners as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5735)|
| 1:35:43| So I really think it lends a lot of credibility to the time that we've taken tonight to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5743)|
| 1:35:51| And it is just advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| It is just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| I understand what you mean by not worth a hill of beans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| I know exactly what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| Councilmembers Booker and Pilo, we're voting to amend to add the language that KUB has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| So hopefully it's worth a little more than a hill of beans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| Without it, it ain't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Well, we're voting to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| Right now, the motion on the floor is to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| Seeing no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| The motion to amend passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| I heard eight ayes and one no again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| The motion passes as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| 11L is the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Approving the resolution adopted by the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| recommending that the Tennessee General Assembly consider changes to Chapter 148, Private Acts 1983| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| amended by Chapter 229, Private Acts 1984, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| 12A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 5 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| so as to authorize restaurants within the city to permit pet dogs in certain outdoor dining areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| requested by Councilmembers Roddy and Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Mayor, I believe there may be some people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| And with permission of Council, I'd like to hear from them first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| I only have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| I know there might be others that wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I know there's several folks here, but there's only one signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| If there's others that would like to, our rule is just for Council is three can speak in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| three against, and then those in favor have a two-minute opportunity for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| Right now, I only have one person signed up to speak against, which is Sarah Helm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| And if anybody would like to speak for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| Favor goes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| And favor goes first if anybody would like to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| There's somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| I mean, if anybody would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| No one has to, but if you would like to, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| You can come down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| I think you're allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| Those in favor get two minutes to speak in rebuttal, even if they didn't speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| I think that's our rule, so that is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Sarah Helm, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| If you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| Sarah Helm, 7648 Cool Breeze Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5909)|
| 1:38:37| Thank you so much for your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| Again, my name is Sarah Helm, and I have the privilege of serving as the chairperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| for the Knoxville Mayor's Council on Disability Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| And I appreciate the opportunity, again, to address you tonight with our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| about this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| CODI does have a vested interest in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| On September 9th of 2009, we actually held a public forum to address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| and have some discussions about how this ordinance would affect individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| with disabilities within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| We had two community members show up at that time, both of whom were opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| to the passing of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| Since that time, we did allow for public comment from both, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| community members and from the CODI body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| We have received numerous public comments, both in favor and against the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| After reviewing the public comments received and engaging in extensive discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| with our membership, CODI voted on this issue during our October 2009 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| The voting among CODI members resulted in a motion that city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| should be discouraged from passing this ordinance, and that should the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| go through anyway, there needs to be information included about the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| of the ordinance and a minimum of four recommendations that we came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| The first of the recommendations being that we use first-person language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| meaning people with disabilities as opposed to handicapped or disabled person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| And we recognize that that language actually has been changed in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| and we appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| We thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Also, we are hoping that the ordinance could include information that would not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| pet dogs to be there with a retractable leash, that pet dogs would have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| a non-retractable leash that is no longer than six feet in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| We actually consulted with Seeing Eye Foundation, which is in New Jersey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| It is a foundation that works with service animals, and they have dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| with similar ordinances in the past, and they made that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| And also that the restaurants that choose to allow pet dogs have them post signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| that indicates that service animals are allowed beyond a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| meaning that service animals are allowed in the interior of the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| whereas pet dogs would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| And that's just to avoid any confusion between pet dogs and service animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| And people with disabilities have been working for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| to have their service animals permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| So if we could encourage that as well of the restaurant owners to post a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| indicating the difference between service animals and pet dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| in terms of being allowed into the interior, we would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Also, lastly, if we could add to the application some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| from the Department of Justice about service animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| how to train their staff, we would love some educational information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| to be attached to that application that the restaurant owners would sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| indicating that they understand the ADA regulations pertaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| to the admission of service animals in the interior of the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| and just, again, the differences between pet dogs and service dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| We also do have a few remaining questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| We were interested to see if the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| had actually been consulted about the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| and what their reaction to this might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| We also wondered how this will be enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| in terms of the requirements and who will enforce it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| and what might be the penalty for the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| if they do violate any of the requirements of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| Those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| And, again, we appreciate addressing you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| If anybody would like to that's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Vice Mayor Becker has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| What you said is Cody voted to oppose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| but if it's adopted, they want to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| So even if this is adopted, Cody would still be opposed to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| Even if all the recommendations are adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| or did you all talk about that eventuality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| Actually, I think as a whole, the body of Cody feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| as though we're encouraging the ordinance to not pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| just for the safety of individuals with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| But these were the recommendations that we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| Can you talk a little more about why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| What is it that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| these are some excellent recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| and I want to get a little more into what the feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| with Cody members on why in general this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| I think a lot of the comments focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| just a lack of canine training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| For instance, people might believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| that their pet dogs are well-behaved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| but there are different definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| of what well-behaved might mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| I think that individuals are a little bit concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| about whether or not pet dogs would interfere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| with working animals, whether that be, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| service dogs or any other type of service animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| So that was the majority of our issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| We certainly also talked about just allergies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| people who have really bad allergies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| and how that might affect them when dining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| But our other issue was just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| is this going to broaden the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| of what we mean by pet animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Is it later on down the road going to be pet cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| and maybe some additional animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| How are we going to set a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| that it's just going to be kept to pet dogs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Okay, Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| So broadly speaking, I hear you saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| that Cody has a concern that allowing pets on patios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| is going to confuse the culture enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| so people with service dogs will not be permitted inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| I think just in terms of we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| that the restaurant staff is educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| with the difference of pet dogs and service animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| that there won't be confusion that, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| service animals are allowed inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| whereas pet dogs are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| So it's that confusion between a working animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| and a non-working animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| and I think it's also the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| about the interaction on the patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| between a working animal and a non-working animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| As the co-sponsor, I also definitely have that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| You mentioned that there were members of Cody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| that actually were in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| What were they saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| What did they like about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| I think the idea that Knoxville is trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| to be a pet-friendly city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| and that it might bring more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| to the city of Knoxville, to the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| I think very similar to how most people feel about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| in terms of being in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| We talked a lot about having a personal opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| and then a professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| and of course we tried to distinguish between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| and making sure that we are taking into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| our constituent group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| which are people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| One more question for Ms. Helm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| I know that I don't think I talked with you about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| but I did talk with Ms. Cook about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| And your Cody body is quite large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| I believe there's about 18 on your committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| but your quorum is quite small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| What is your quorum for doing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Do you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| I believe it is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| Okay, tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| And city council members were forwarded the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| when Cody took this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| And I think it's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| because we know that there were some members of Cody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| who were in favor and some who were against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| that when the motion was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| there were eight members of the 18-member committee present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| which did constitute a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| and the motion to oppose this did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| So I'm certainly not discounting anyone's opinion who was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| but there was a significant number of Cody members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| who were not there when this particular motion was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| In terms of the public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| we did have five additional Cody members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| who did participate in the public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| all five of which were opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| And I think I echo Mr. Woodhull's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| As a co-sponsor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| I had a great conversation with Ms. Helm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| and it seems that the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| or the concern about this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| relates more to the confusion that it might create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| for persons with disabilities who use service animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| And I guess there's also perhaps some concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| about the service animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| interacting with the pet animals on the patios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| but the primary concern that I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| was about the confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| between the two animal populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| So I hope, as we discuss this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| maybe we can talk about incorporating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| some of Cody's suggestions about the leash length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| and the retractability and those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| and perhaps come to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| where we can satisfy everybody's concerns in a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| But I'd like to listen to others' comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| since I'm one of the co-makers of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| I just had a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| because, frankly, I feel like I'm very particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| about reading all e-mails I receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| But, you know, I honestly do not recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| receiving this information from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| When was that forwarded to us, this past week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| I sent an e-mail, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| to all members on November 17th at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| but I just don't recall receiving that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| or responding to you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| So this caught me quite by surprise tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| Normally, I would copy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| and I would place it with the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| so that I would be sure that I was looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| That would have been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Isn't this supposed to be Cyber Week or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| I don't think I received the e-mail either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| But I wanted to ask someone within the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| Dr. Lyons, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| what's the flavor of our downtown residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| and also our outdoor dining restaurants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Thanks, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Actually, Hannah Parker, who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| and Michelle Hummel did a kind of a survey walk-around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| and spoke to the downtown restaurant owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| And I would say, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| the reaction was pretty much ambivalence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| It wasn't strong opposition or strong favor either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| And downtown residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| I know I see a few are out here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| but I haven't heard much on one side or the other of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| I've heard probably more positive than negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| but that's very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| would dignify that with calling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| any more than impressionistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Because I generally thought this was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| We're moving in the direction of allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| dogs on leashes around in the downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| and we've done a number of things which I won't go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| concerning the pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| But I just thought it was something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| you know, it would be worth trying for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| If it doesn't work, we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| First, this is an opt-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| If a restaurant doesn't want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| they don't have to go through the process to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Actually, three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Second, I appreciate what Cody's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| one of the suggestions I specifically recall was like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| six or an eight foot long leash for a pet dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6597)|
| 1:50:04| I see issues with notifying people about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| and forcing that issue, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| And secondly, I remember receiving the information from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| Cody because if folks will recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| this was on last council's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| Councilman Woodhull hadn't gotten his shots and was out sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| And so maybe they weren't resent before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| but a lot of time has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| It took me a while to realize I've already received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| But those are just my general thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| What about the six foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| Is it a six foot leash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| I mean, it's got to be practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| I mean, how can it practically work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Now, we understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| and that's why we had some questions also about enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| and who would be responsible for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| and how that process would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| We also just talked about maybe putting something in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| ordinance about simply a non-retractable leash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| so that pet dogs would need to be on a fixed length leash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| It might not necessarily have to be six to eight feet necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| but just a fixed length leash for more control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| versus a retractable leash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| But we certainly do understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| that will be difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| One of the questions I didn't address earlier that Ms. Helm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| asked, and which I think was a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| was what was the penalty for not complying with this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| And that is listed on the very last page on page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| that any violation of this part by the holder of the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| shall, upon conviction, result in a fine not to exceed $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| That is our maximum fine as a municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| In terms of enforcement, I guess Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| is in another conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Maybe I'll ask somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| Who do we assume Chief Gass would enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| Would this be codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| or would this be the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Since Ms. Helm brought up that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| that's worthy of addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| I think that's something we just have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| and have a discussion on at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| I wasn't aware this was going to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| I think maybe Debbie can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| The state law only provides for the local municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| to have the permitting procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| The rest of the enforcement is left to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| So it would be a health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| All complaints for noncompliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| would be referred to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| I think one of the things that Mr. Frost pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| I've heard from some restaurant owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| that would like to pick this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| and I've heard from some restaurant owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| who definitely don't want to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| I think it provides another option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| another tool in our toolbox for attracting folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| particularly to downtown, who live downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| and enjoy bringing their pets with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| If it's something that a restaurant owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| is comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| and their patrons are comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| they can pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| If not, they cannot take part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| As Councilman Bailey said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| you know, maybe it's something we want to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| This ordinance is scheduled to go into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| in January in the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| so as the warmer months approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| and folks are more likely to be out with their pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| we can give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| And if we find that there's some things in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| that are not workable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| we can come back and amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| or we can delete it entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| But I thought it was a new option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| that was worthy of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| Following up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| since the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| is going to be the body that enforces this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| do they know about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| How do they feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| All I can say is that the state law provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| for them to be the enforcing agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| So I do not know if they've been consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| The state law provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| that the health department is the enforcing agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| But what happens if they don't make it a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| or it's buried somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| I mean, just a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| I mean, I certainly don't know everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| about how the health department operates their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| But my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| in a visit with a restaurant owner this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| was that the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| does make surprise visits to restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| And this compliance or noncompliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| would be inclusive in their inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| of the kitchen area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| and how business is taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| in that particular establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| I think it's also worth noting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| that without this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| restaurants can be cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| when people do bring their dogs to patios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| And that's happened recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| More and more people are enjoying our patios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| and walking places instead of driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| And they're including their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Ms. Poplin, just a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| If a restaurant is leasing space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| in the public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| does the city have joint responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| or at least potential opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| to enforce within the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| in addition to the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| Under the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| it would just be the responsibility of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| Even if it's in the right-of-way on the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| Because it's part of the operation of the restaurant, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| And they lease that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| They don't lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| They're given a use permit for that patio area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| as part of their restaurant business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Is there a motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| There's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| I was going to say I believe the health department is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| Stephanie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| I was just going to say that Ronnie Neese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| is with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| and he happens to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| So if it would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| he could maybe address the enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| If you'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| I think there's some members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| that would like to hear that if you'd come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| He just happens to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| If you'd give us your name and title, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| My name is Ronnie Neese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| I'm the director of environmental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| for Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| And we have the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| for the restaurant inspection in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| In looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| it is a state ordinance or a state law that we enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| And we work for the state of Tennessee here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| The ordinance, the way that you have it written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| the way I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| and I've asked for an interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| from the state on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| is if we see a facility that's not in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| with the way you have the ordinance written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| that we would cite them as a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| when we do our inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| And as I said, I've asked for an opinion from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| from their law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| basically if that's the right interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| But if we saw an animal on the patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| and they don't have a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| that's a violation of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| If they have a permit, and this is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| as I said, I haven't got it verified yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| if they have a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| and they're not meeting the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| that you have laid out in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| they're in violation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Because the state law allows you as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| to pass a resolution or an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| to allow this to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| Have I answered your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| That was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| Ms. Rodden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| I'd like to go ahead and make a motion for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| and then make a motion for a few amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| as suggested by Cody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| So motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| Real quickly, Ms. Pomplin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| does that sound accurate to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| I mean, his...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Yes, it sounds exactly accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| Go ahead, Ms. Rodden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| I'd like to make two amendments to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| as it currently reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| One would be to add some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| that the pet dog be on a non-retractable leash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| I'm not going to specify the length at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| but I'd like to go with a non-retractable leash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| do you have any idea where in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| that might wear a leash is addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| I haven't looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Number five, page three, number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| Patrons shall keep their pet dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| on a non-retractable leash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| And then shall I make my second motion as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| My second amendment has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| with the educational information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| that the Cody Board suggested be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| to restaurant owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| who choose to participate in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| And I did ask in consultation with Ms. Cook and Ms. Helm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| I was provided the last two pieces of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| of your resolution are what's called a white paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| from the Department of Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| and it's kind of a frequently asked questions piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| on service animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| And I ask that that be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| just so that when any members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| would pull this off the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| as we were in consideration of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| they would see that it was very important to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| that that discernment that we distinguished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| between the pet dogs and the service dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| So my second amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| is that this Department of Justice white paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| be part of the permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| so that when a restaurant comes in to receive a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| that they are given a copy of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| and that's part of the permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| Now, Mr. Swanson, would that go under...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| Subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| On the last page, on page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| So would you like to propose some language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Would you like me to propose some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| that addresses that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| Say applicants shall be furnished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| with educational information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| prepared by the Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| with regard to service animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| So that's my second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Two amendments on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Discussion on either of the two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| We probably will consider them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| unless somebody on council objects to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| So any discussion on either of the amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| We did leave time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| If anybody on the floor side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| wanted to say anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| you do have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| if anybody would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| You don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| We're not making...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Nobody has to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| but if you'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Then we're going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| on both of those amendments together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| unless somebody waves me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| All those in favor of both amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| Now back to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| I want another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| in my conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| with some folks from Cody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| got to some of the signage stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| And I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| And this is hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Ms. Rowdy and Mr. Wood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| I'll see if this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| And this got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| some of that blurring feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| between service animals and pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| And it goes to signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| And this might be micromanaging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| but what the suggestion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| is that the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| going from the patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| into the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| say something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| only service animals allowed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| And some of the distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| sort of saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| Inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Inside, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| Instead of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| no animals allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| in a little tiny print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| except for changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| that dynamic to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| only service animals allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| beyond this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| It feels a little micromanaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| and it's your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| But that felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| a nice distinction to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| And I think I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| And I think, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| that would go under number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| The 8, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| Yes, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| I guess it would be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| That would be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| Okay, now...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| Okay, we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Just so I'm clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| has been amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| and you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| We approved the first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| You're asking to amend again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| I mean, I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| I agree with what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| but 8 doesn't really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| You're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| put a more positive...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Yeah, I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| ...application on the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| Yeah, and I was sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| thinking of sticking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| And it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| it could be as simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| and I know Mr. Swanson's pen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| is moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| restaurants shall post a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| between the patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| and the main dining area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| only service animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| could be something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| I don't have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| The language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| is not necessarily clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| but the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| made sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| How about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| The restaurant owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| shall also provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| additional signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| stating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| only service animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| allowed beyond this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| at an appropriate place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| That feels good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Discussion on this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| and I just want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| that the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| for a restaurant owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| to post that service animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| beyond this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| service animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| are always allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| in restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| It's just a reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| and a clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| and that posting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| would only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| if a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| chose to take part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| if you are a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| that's not even tangling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| with dogs on your patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| then you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| to post that service dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| in your restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| because that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| be a given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| under the Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| with Disabilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| back to the third amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| All those in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| we're back to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| Mr. Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| I'm just trying to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| that might occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| a restaurant that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| opted in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| are they going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| to post something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| that says we allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| pets on our patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| or is that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| how do people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| which restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| and which ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| that that's addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| I assume that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| would probably want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| to post something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| They do have to post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| a sign relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| to the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| that are in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| And we had a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Ms. Poplin and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| had a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| about the permitting fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| that is asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| of the restaurant owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| and that for that fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| they might be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| to receive a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| so that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| sort of a standard look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| Didn't we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| about the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| making up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| some kind of sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| that was standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| so that when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| visited a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| that allowed dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| on their patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| the sign would be present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| And I also was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| trying to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| some value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| There was some question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| that Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| and I discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| about this permitting fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| And it is provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| for in the state language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| you can't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| allow dogs on patios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| and then folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| come into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| and say hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| I want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| and boom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| they've got to pay a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| So I was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| for a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| to add value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| for the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| when they paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| that fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| And the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| was to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7503)|
| 2:05:04| some kind of small sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| that would be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| that they could display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| on their patio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| that addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| that dogs were allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| need to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| a six-foot leash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| or on a non-retractable leash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| So you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| state law requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| in the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| that states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| and our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| tracks that state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| if it's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| that signage there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| it's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| If it doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| that signage there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| then it's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| The other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| I'm wondering about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| is what I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| I guess we'd call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| pocket dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| little bitty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| rodent-sized critters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| that people put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| in their pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| or in their purses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| chihuahuas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| People show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| a little pocket dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| that's in their purse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| and they don't have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| on a leash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| and they put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| on the seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| or they put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| it's not that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| going to be an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091201?start=7567)|
