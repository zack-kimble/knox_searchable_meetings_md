| 0:00:00| Russ, Mr. Jensen, if you want, we don't seem to have an order right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| You stood up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:11| Well, Janet and I did rock, paper, scissors, and I won, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11)|
| 0:00:16| First of all, I wanted to piggyback on the back, and in particular with the public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:22| folks that we work very closely with and the amazing job that they've done throughout this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=22)|
| 0:00:26| last year, in particular during the ice storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:30| As you know, 301 is the answer point for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| We answer anywhere from about 180,000 to 200,000 calls a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| That has actually come down just a tad from about five years ago when we were about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=37)|
| 0:00:41| quarter million calls, and that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=41)|
| 0:00:44| We're doing a little bit fewer service requests, but we've also added service request types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| throughout the year, so that's kind of a wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| But the reason the call volume has gone down a bit is because as opposed to about ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| ago when we opened and we just celebrated our birthday this month, people are not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| to call back multiple times for the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| So they're calling once, asking for a service, and it's getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| And so it shows that the system's working, and that is as much a reflection on the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| out in the street doing the work as it is the people who are answering the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| So we are very appreciative of the folks with David Brace, Parks and Rec, everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| Some things from this last year, you heard me talk about last year kicking off the inaugural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| ambassador program, which is an encompassing program enterprise-wide where we bring employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| in from different departments and they work together and look at systemic issues and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| to ways where we can improve our customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| And I've been very gratified with the group that we've been working with this year with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| both their dedication and their stick-to-itiveness, and we just presented three projects to Christie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| this past month, and we're getting ready to move forward with that and present those to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| the mayor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| But they have done yeoman's work on top of their regular day job to come up with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| really good projects, and then they will hand it off to another group next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| So we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Also, this year we worked with the O'Connor Senior Center, and we've trained over 80 senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| citizens in the use of tablets in what we've kind of nicknamed our digital inclusion project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| All too often, senior citizens are left behind when it comes to using technology, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| have difficulty with smartphones because of the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| They're too small for their hands and their eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| Senior citizens have rapidly become more than 50% of the tablet market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| So we've been working with the O'Connor Senior Center, and we've been going over there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| helping them train seniors to use tablets, and then we have a little program where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| can hit a button on their tablet, and they can actually talk to one of our people face-to-face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| because senior citizens like to know who they're talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| So that's been really successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| And then working with Codes Enforcement and Public Service on an awareness campaign this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| year, you'll see things on TV throughout the course of the year with the Codes Enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| people out there doing neighborhood sweeps and what have you, anything we can do to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| the public informed of how things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| And in the long run, it makes all our jobs a little bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| And then last but not least, one of the things I'm the most proud of this year is during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| the snow and ice storms, 311 didn't miss a minute having the phones turned on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| 311 was never closed during all that time, and I'm very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| The folks, you know, slept on the floor one night, slept down the street one night, packing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| up and going down to the city-county building down Main Street at 6 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| We actually had a lot of fun with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| But I'm just really, really proud of the people that work up in that room, and they make my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| life very, very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Last but not least, we're in the middle of implementation of Phase 1, as David alluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| to, with Accela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| And I am ecstatic at the way that program is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Janet has done a fantastic job of getting us a great product at a really good price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| and her folks are doing a wonderful job in the implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| And any of you know me, that if you see me skipping down the hall about being happy about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| a project, that's saying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| And I think everybody's going to be really happy when we flip the switch on this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| around Christmastime and start using it and move forward with the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| With that, our budget's really not very complicated, so I will throw it out to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Russ, you said something that kind of piqued my interest, and I don't know that you told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| me enough about it to understand it, but I like the idea that you're not only gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| tons of data from the phone calls and stuff, but that there's some effort to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| is there a pattern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| How do we deal with things differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Could you talk a little bit more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Because it seems to me that, you know, it's sort of like a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| You can just have piles of numbers that you organize in columns, or you can learn something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| from them, and Jim does a great job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Tell us a little bit more about this data gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| We talk about that on a fairly regular basis, and even with the system we're using now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| which is a Motorola system, we do about 40, anywhere from 42,000 to 48,000 service requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| a year, and we track not only where, but when, how often, are we going to the same property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| more than once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| David, a couple of years ago, after a series of bad freezes, he looked at the trends of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| brush pickup, and he noticed that the first couple of weeks of brush season really wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| that busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| So he made the decision that they were going to suspend brush pickup for two weeks, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| they were going to focus on nothing but potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Now we got a couple of calls that first week, but when we explained to people what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| doing, they were actually very appreciative, and I think, and we have to confirm with David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| I think he saved about anywhere from $15,000 to $20,000 in overtime doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| So that is just one small example of how everybody's gotten used to using the data that comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| of 311 on a regular basis on their day-to-day operations, and every department is looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| at things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| And with this new system, we're all going to be on the same piece of software, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| going to be that much more seamless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| And is that something you farm out the information to them, or you bring them in to analyze it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| How do you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| It's a little bit of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| They have access to a lot of that information, so they can actually go get it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| I send reports out on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| When we have regular staff meetings, generally we'll have two or three during the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| That's all we do is we look at some of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| And in particular, we're looking at trends over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| When we first built 311, you couldn't just say last month was a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Well, we've got 10 years' worth of data now where we can see where the trends are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| You can crank it, look at it, and decide what it's telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Yeah, and I'm a numbers geek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| It's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you, Mr. Jensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| You can see why I asked them to go before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:47| They paved the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Janet Wright, Director of Information Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| We have approximately 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| We support every department in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| We consider them great partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Our biggest partner, our biggest customer, and we call them customers, is KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| In fact, with mobile units out there, we have 270 cars with laptops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| The help desk refers to them when they come in as a drive-by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| That's a little computer humor, very little, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| We have some projects that we've worked on this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| The website being a big one, and Jesse referred to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| In fact, today, while we were sitting here in the meeting, we brought up the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| with its real name, which is going to be KnoxvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| So if you have a tablet or laptop, you can go to that URL, and it is live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| Also, the city of Knoxville website is live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| So we have two things going on at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| The reason we're doing that is so that we can continue to test this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| This is a soft go live, so don't tell everybody that it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| So that we can fix some things that we need to, tweak some things that need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| KnoxvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| KnoxvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Is in the trial phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| www.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| That's in the trial phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| That's the one we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| That's the one that's in the trial phase, and you can go directly to that website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| The other thing that we will be doing before the end of this fiscal year, and we'll count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| this as an accomplishment, and it is another big one, we will be changing our email addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| to instead of cityofknoxville.org, they will be KnoxvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| So that will happen sometime after the website goes live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| AVL, we've already mentioned how useful that's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Some of the things that we're looking at are idle time, speed, location, hard acceleration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| hard deceleration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| This has really helped us look at some driver behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| I'm just really glad it's not on my car, because I would get the hard acceleration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| But they use it as an opportunity to coach people, and we've already seen a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| reduction in idle time, which, as you know, reduces our fuel usage, which is a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| The next phase of this project, as David mentioned, we'll be adding 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| And since these vehicles that we're adding are shared by drivers, we also are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| be implementing a FOB, which is a little round device that is red when you get into the car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| so we'll be able to identify the driver that's driving that car, or truck, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| So I think that'll be, we'll see some good things about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| We'll be able to go back and over history, we keep a year's worth of history, and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| back and look and see how people have improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| I think that'll be a good enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| This year, my staff has replaced over 800 computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| 300 of those will be going out soon, by June 15th, and they'll be, we are replacing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| laptops in the patrol cars with tablets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| So that'll be a big thing for them to get adjusted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| So instead of flipping open a laptop, and we'll also be putting printers in all their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| cars because in July, that's what we're thinking right now, after the new 911 system goes live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:53| we will introduce e-citations to Knoxville, to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| So they'll be printing out tickets to give to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| So that'll be an exciting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| We've also implemented time clocks, and what we call web punch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:16| And this is to get a better fix, and we've done this in conjunction with civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| to get a better fix on our non-exempt employees when they're clocking in and clocking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| And I think this will help us maybe reduce some costs in overtime, because if they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| in early, we're supposed to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| So this is a way we can sort of regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| We have been working also with the fire department on several projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| For the first time, when the 911 system is implemented, which will be 1st of July in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| that time frame, the fire trucks will have mobile tablets in every fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| So the dispatchers will be able to see where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| AVL is part of this project, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| So the dispatchers will be able to see on a map where the patrol is and where the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| trucks are, and that will assist them greatly in dispatching the closest vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| So that'll be a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| Now, what does the future hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Well, we've talked about this phase 1 work order system, and when I came before you before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| I said, I'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| And so phase 2, phase 1 includes the 311 software, the public service work orders, codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:41| When we come back and do phase 2, that will include all of the engineering and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| inspections, and we'll be expanding our asset management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| So all of this information by hopefully maybe a year and a half from now, phase 1 is supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=774)|
| 0:13:02| to be completed in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| It may be completed a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| And then we'll begin phase 2 based on approval of funding for that capital project request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| and we'll continue to expand this throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| I think this is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| The future also holds a new fire station alerting system in conjunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| After we go live with 911, we're going to go back and look at the fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| There's automation there that will open up the doors of the bays to the fire trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| turn on lights, do some audible alarms and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| So we'll be going out for bid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| The RFP is already completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| We'll be doing some new crash reporting for KPD, some energy management software for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| Office of Sustainability, Park and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| We just went out for bid for online services for Park and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| So parents and people that have a credit card will be able to go out and reserve a shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| sign up for a sports league, pay for classes, do everything online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| So you'll see that as an enhancement to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| As we said, that website is only going to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| CAT will be doing some automation and also AVL will be included in that in their Lyft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| service, which is a service where folks call to get picked up to go to the doctor and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| So that's sort of a daily kind of scheduling and where's my bus driver right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| And with that said, I come to these meetings to hear the ideas that other people have because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| I'm thinking, oh no, we've got to implement that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| But it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| We always have a lot of work and we enjoy doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Councilman, does that translate into fewer people can accomplish more jobs or more work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| In other words, over time is there a cost saving in terms of utilization of personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| It's funny that you ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| I've been in this business for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| And sometimes when you add automation, you can add people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| But then what happens is this task that somebody over here used to do is now automated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| So you have to do what we're doing is you have to morph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| You have to look at all your jobs and say, can I give this work to this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| So it really depends on what the department is and what the function is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| So I couldn't say yes or no, but it's something that we constantly evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Did you just say you become king eventually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| So what happens to you extinguish the city of Knoxville.org and go to KnoxvilleTennessee.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| So what happens to your email addresses and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Well, we actually have two email addresses that work right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| And we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| You don't remember this, but prior to cityofknoxville.org, it was ci.knoxville.ten.us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| And we kept it alive and the city of Knoxville alive because things change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| So it'll still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| We want to make sure you still get your email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| I was hoping you'd cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| We won't cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| That would be a special request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| The laptops that you're replacing, are they donated somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| Do they go to the recycle bin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| What happens to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Well, all of our computer equipment that is labeled as surplus is handled by the purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| department and they auction it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| In some cases, we take that surplus equipment and we designate it for city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| For instance, park and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We send surplus computers so that the kids that are there for after school programs can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| use those computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| And when they break, we don't try to fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| We just give them another surplus computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Councilman, very quickly, we need to conclude this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Are you experimenting with, I don't know, like leasing or renting software as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| to buying it and installing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| There's a change in the world that I don't quite understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Yes, the world has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| It's called software as a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| In fact, that's how we get our email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Microsoft, actually, we lease our email from Microsoft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| We're seeing that our agenda management system that you use, that council uses, we lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| So that is the new trend for vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Is it good or bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Well, it has pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| One of the cons is sometimes we don't know when they're going to have an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| If we have it in-house, we can control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| But the nice thing is they take care of the backups and restores and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| So that does take a little bit off of my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you, Ms. Wright, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Well, I'm going to go ahead and cut it off because, you know, we've got people coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| back here at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| And I'm sure council members are going to want to go out and get some lunch so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| keep on that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| So I think, unfortunately, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Janet, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| But I think in the interest of time here, we need to go ahead and cut it off right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| We'll resume back at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| Finance department, no significant changes in the finance department budget going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| with the exception of one thing, and we'll mention it here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| Our total budget, again, is primarily salary and benefit driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| We're, again, like most of the departments that you've seen today, with roughly around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| 70% of our budget being involved in personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| Finance department is kind of one of those back office operations that you need to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:36| your business continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| We're the ones that collect the money, we're the ones that make sure people get paid, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| ones that pay our vendors, the ones that purchase goods and services and handle those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Some of the things that we were successful at in this past year, we did a new money bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| issue for about a little over $31 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| I think we've got excellent rates on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| We did a new restructuring of the variable rate debt on the convention center, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| were capturing some annual savings as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| As part of those bond issues, we were successful in the city's bond rating were reaffirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| at very high levels, and I think that's something that reflects on the administration and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:37| and so forth in helping us to handle things in a financially responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:50| The other thing we've done is we continue to work to try and improve the collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| of our property taxes, and we'll continue to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Same thing with contract management and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| The big thing that we're trying to do from an efficiency standpoint is, like everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| else, we're trying to do more things electronically, and that goes from our accounting systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:21| to our treasury management functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Though I don't think it's possible, eventually we would like to get to the point where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| don't issue any checks, that everything is done electronically, where things are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| by computer, and again, our goal is to save fractions of a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| The same thing with our investments, to try and maximize our returns, and I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| We continue to beat our benchmarks in terms of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| Even though we don't get a lot of money anymore just because rates are so low, we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| beating those benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| The one difference that is in our budget, and we have included $50,000 for the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| Entrepreneurial Center, and I'm going to let Kristi just talk a little bit about that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| I believe all of you were at Council when the Executive Director, Jim Biggs, from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| KEC came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| This initiative was started by the City of Knoxville, and we have a lot of great partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| who have joined us in supporting KEC, and this year in the budget, we do have $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| in additional investment in the KEC, and Rhonda Rice, who was here earlier, did not mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| this, but Innovation Valley is also putting in another $50,000 into the KEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| Launch Tennessee, of course, it is one of the nine accelerators that's part of Launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| Tennessee, which is the Governor's accelerator program, so we do get funding from Launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| Tennessee, and we have applied for a grant just recently that we'll find out about tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| actually, that could give us significant funding of the Entrepreneurial Center, so if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| happens, we'll be sure to let you guys know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| I'll answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Why is that in this part of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Why wouldn't that be somewhere else, the $50,000 for the Entrepreneurial Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| There are some things that we just don't, I mean, honestly, we don't quite know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| to put, and this was one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| We didn't know where it fit, so we put it under finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| That's not a community agency grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| This is more of a contractual relationship, and we have a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| You have some of those that weren't mentioned, for example, like the rescue squad, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| is in the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Now, that actually fits somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| You've got the affordable housing program, and I think that's with the ETSC Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| and that's under community development, so some of those things that are contractual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| in nature, we do tend to put under the departments, and again, this one, just one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:08| where we decided to put it under finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Yeah, I think it's part of our economic development programming, too, and our initiatives, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| I'm in finance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| So that's probably one reason it got put in there, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Jim, this is a real minor question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Looking at revenue enforcement, 21-280, there's a bigger jump than most of the categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| for salary benefit things, and you still have three positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| I guess someone got promoted or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| I can't figure out why it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| It isn't like 3% or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| With salaries and benefits, it could be a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| One is we've probably had somebody promoted to like a senior account clerk or senior collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| specialist, and again, when you have divisions like that, and this is very possible, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| I could double check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Somebody could change from employee to family coverage on health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| That would be enough, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| In a small group, for example, if you were to do the same thing in legislative office, you could have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| kind of impacts where they seem to jump, but there's nothing unusual about those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| In terms of technology and cost savings, something you love to talk about, do you get involved with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| 311 data analysis or anything where they look at patterns, ways to save money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| In other words, is it a group collective activity where you sit down and start kind of weighing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| what we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Everything is kind of a group kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| We're always looking for efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| And the other question we have to be involved with is how are we going to pay for some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| that we need to do, and so that's where we're involved in trying to figure out how to finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| How to budget and finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| So you have one capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Do you want to tell us about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| Well, we have one capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| It is to start beginning to look at a new budget system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| Basically, we have an Oracle system, and we have a budget module which we really don't use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:28| We do pretty much everything on spreadsheets because our budget system doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| so one of the things we're looking at is to, again, replace that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Is that the 25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Yes, that's the 25,000 on page two of the capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1610)|
| 0:27:00| We are above using columnar pads, but an abacus might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Any other questions for Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I want Christine to talk about benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Benefits is when you think of functionality, benefits is one of those very, very large cost centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| and I want Christine to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| My name is Christine Fitzgerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| I'm the benefits manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Our primary focus this year and next in the coming years is going to be on wellness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| We really want to improve the health of our employees and our employees' families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| so we've really been looking at a portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Right now you track your activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| If you're on our health plan, on the My Health plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| you track that through this physical activity affidavit that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| so we'd like to get something that might be a little bit more technologically savvy for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| which we think we can do, so that would be exciting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| and it would be a place that we could house all of the My Health requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| so it would be really easy for employees and families to do from home or a smartphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| The other thing that this portal could do is it would be a really great way for somebody to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| and look at their results from their biometric screenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| because right now that information is a little hard to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| You really need to sit down with a provider to go over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| so it could hold both the health risk assessment that you take as well as the biometric screenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| and a really easy-to-read report so you could understand what's wrong with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| so maybe you could understand it enough to try to lead a healthier lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| And then the most exciting thing that we're working on is something that we've partnered with the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| our health and wellness center, and some community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| and it's a program that's been laid out by the Centers of Disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| and Control called the Diabetes Prevention Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| We've piloted two programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| The first program is nearly done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| and one of the participants in that program has lost 22% of their body weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| which is a huge deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| The goal of the program is between 5% and 7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| and on average the other participants are at 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| so it's got a requirement of weekly meetings for 16 weeks and then once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| and that doesn't really seem unreasonable based on some of the ADA legislation that's come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| because it's a program by the CDC, another federal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| So we're pretty excited about it, and we've gotten some really positive feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| so that could be an opportunity for somebody who might fall under that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| The other thing that we're doing is working with other community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| to figure out how we can tackle some of our other chronic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| So, again, the focus really is on wellness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| and how we can help employees and their families get healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| You mentioned diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| What illnesses seem to have the most cost impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Is it back injuries from lifting things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Is it something like diabetes or cancer or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| It's diabetes and it's hypertension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| And both of those can be attributed to obesity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| so that's actually an area we really want to target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Work with other organizations like East Tennessee Children's Hospital for obesity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| They have a program for obesity for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| We really want to see how we can work with community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| and what programs they're involved in so we can all work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and live in a healthier community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| So what you do is you offer it, and it's volunteer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| I mean, they can participate, but you offer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| and then the insurance companies give you a really nice discount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| because you're offering wellness programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Like if you're a fully insured program, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I think Blue Cross Blue Shield, UnitedHealthcare, Humanas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| they would definitely do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| and I know that that does happen on the fully insured side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| We are self-funded, so we pay all of the claims out of our bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| So we have a vested interest to try to get people healthier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| because we want to see those claims go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| You just make it available to them and make it to them during their work day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| and so it's attractive to come, but they just strictly volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| It is voluntary now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I would love to see something be a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| like just have stricter requirements, and we're actually doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| So the center hasn't always been able to track our requirements very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| but we've just sat down with them and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| these are things that are super important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| and this is where we want you to focus your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| So we're kicking people out of MyHealth now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| when they don't do what they're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| So if you get a postcard, that's like a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| I really need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Let me call them and see where I'm failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| and we're hoping that that's really going to encourage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Boyce, finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Sorry you had to be the one out the first of the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I'm the purchasing agent for the city, and that's absolutely fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| I sit back there with Janet because, like her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| I've got to hear what everybody else is doing so I can kind of set my priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| With that, as far as the internal budget to purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| you're not going to see any big new starts or really any change there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| because we handle a lot of folks' money, but we have very little of our own, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| And just a quick overview of purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| We've got nine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| We've got assistant purchasing agent Janice McClellan, three buyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| a small business specialist, contract manager Penny Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| a surplus property officer, and an admin assistant and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| and that kind of makes up purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| And what we do, like I say, we're behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| We support every department and division in the city, those that are in here now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| and those that are in the morning, and probably some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| And our overall thing we try to really do, if you break it down into a one-liner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| is strike the right balance between wise spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| and timely support to the departments we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| That's it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Over the past 12 months, just a couple of highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| They become highlights when you consider the small size of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| We've processed 602 requisitions into purchase orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| and contracts for a total of about $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| We also manage the city's purchase card program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| which equates to about $2 million each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| and that's literally thousands of transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| The contract manager looks at and deals with 250 approximately active contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| on any given one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Those are the amount that are active in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| She deobligates around 259 old purchase orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| deobs the money on those to free them back up to the departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| which is worth about $2.8 million each year, and was this last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| And we've processed about 293 contract requests through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| And Charles talked about a lot of the work that goes into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Well, our job is to kind of be the police on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| to make sure that we're not handing the law department a bunch of junk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| where they've got to do a bunch of unnecessary research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| We knock out a lot of that stuff up front and make sure it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Surplus property, we also handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And we sold this last year right at $700,000 worth of surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| That includes vehicles and so forth from the impound lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| and that includes also a lot of just supplies, equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| things that have reached the end of their useful lifespan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| We do those in Internet auctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| We've also got a small business specialist that works the small business program for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| And a little known fact is we've got the mail room under us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| which is another two folks that run all the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| And those are kind of the keys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| Before I turn it over to the questions, though, just take one plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| We do have the city's small business breakfast coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| or it's actually the business breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Our target audience is small business on June 10th at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| And I plan to send you an e-mail here probably tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| If you could, like, fire that or let out to some folks that you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| some of your constituents that own businesses, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I want to get as many people there so they know about the procurement forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| for the city for the upcoming 12 to 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| And pending any questions, that's all that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| I think Ms. Palmer was ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| I just wanted to plug in for the business breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| When I first came to council, I attended one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| and it was really, really helpful to understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| And as questions come up from folks about how do you do this or how do you don't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| it was really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| So if any of you have not been, I would really encourage you to attend and become enlightened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Yes, boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| I want to ask you about how we're doing with our minority businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| and contracting and subcontracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| I think you issued, I guess it's from your office, a report recently on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| And I've got the facts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| This last FY, we had minority-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| We might have gone up two, as Jim called them, basis points or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| but we were at 2.9% for a total real value of $1.5 million and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:14| Women-owned businesses, we're at 11% with $5.8 million and some change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| which brings the combined total of those two to $7.3 million, which is 13.9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| Small businesses, I was very, very pleased with that one in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| We're hitting 33%, and that was at $17.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| And indications are that the small business numbers are rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| So you would say we're doing better, but we're not where we want to be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| I would say that we're doing better in small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| I'd say that women-owned businesses were up slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| Minority-owned businesses were probably relatively flat, relatively flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| about where we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| That breakfast will help with that in terms of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| If folks attend, and, I mean, we do all we can to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I've been sending out personalized e-mails, e-mail blasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| I'm going on TV a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| As a matter of fact, more than a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Eric Vreeland set me up with that and his folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| and we even got something in a publication in a kind of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| I think it's called the Urban Voice, which is a minority-type periodical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| So we try to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| Here's the deal on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| If you show up, I've always been told by businesses it's very beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| because you can see what it is from the directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| They tell a small group like about the size of this little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| if you want to call it a, I don't know, courtyard or whatever here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| They'll tell them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| this is what we're going to buy up over the next 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| and here's when we're going to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Here's when it's going to go out for bid or quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| That's the best way I know to start posturing yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and you can get detailed questions answered right there from the horse's mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| A lot better than me standing up talking about bonds and insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| and all the rest of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| I can do that, but they want to hear, you know, show me the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| We vote on a lot of contracts, and in there it has in our packet good faith efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| But a lot of times I don't know if those good faith efforts are really being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| and therefore these minority contractors are not getting the subcontracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| or even the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| So we've got a ways to go to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| I'm going to be perfectly frank on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| It's like we were talking during the break, and just so the others know here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| we had some plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| In fact, I briefed this body on it a little over a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| on a small local business enterprise ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| and I think that would really give our DBEs a shot in the arm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| as far as the amount of business, at least the local ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| But when the AG opinion came out from the states saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| that you could not even entertain the idea of executing any preferential bidding practices whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| we had to back off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| So now it's a case of the best you can do is let folks know what's coming out for bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| and when it's coming out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| And I don't know what else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| That's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| A little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| You have some other event, I guess, once a year over at the Foundry or someplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| where you talk more about contracting with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| Is that now morphed into the breakfast, or are they the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| It started off at the Foundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| That was the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| We started off at the Foundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| It grew until we started finally having to have it at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| That was the same event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Now, what you could be thinking about, we also are a major player in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| East Tennessee Purchasing Association's business matchmaking event each year in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| that takes place out at Rothschilds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| And we try to link businesses up with available opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| But that's not just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| That's local governments from Bristol to Chattanooga and in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| One of the things you did, I remember a year or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| was raise the limit, so to speak, of small contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| so that they might not be as cumbersome for a small business to get an award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| In fact, this body voted to raise the threshold for the bid bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| It had to be $100,000 or more project in order for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| To tell you the truth, it hadn't hurt us, and I do think it's helped businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| I mean, who wants to come up with a $9.9 thousand bond for a relatively small project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2510)|
| 0:42:00| It seems like the more, I hate to use this word, but bureaucratic steps you've got to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| the less likely a small business wants to get tied up in that knot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| They want to do something and go home and get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| And the more you can court them and let them know that we're people on this end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| and not just some big bureaucracy, the better it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Well, one of the key things with small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| and DBEs in general is what Mayor Brown was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| and that is teaming and that is subcontracting for somebody until such time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| that you're able to go out and bid on things as the prime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| And those are the things I love to see when we have somebody come in and subcontract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| But frankly, there's not much we can do to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| But it helps them grow their business so they can be a player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| That's where the money's at if you're a small business or a DBE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| I asked this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| It looks like the Sustainability Office does some work with MRS Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| Do you guys still stay involved with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| That was your contract and bid and the arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| We did what we used to call the Army battle handover on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| We handed that off to the Sustainability Office probably a little over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| That was kind of more of a fit for the long-term monitoring on measurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| and verification and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| That's really the only piece left, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| That and the maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| All the capital improvements that they were to do are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| I think we were to save roughly $1.1 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| and then it goes up a little bit each year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| And I understand for the past two, three, however long it's been, calendar years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| we have been meeting the savings that we're supposed to by that performance-based contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:47| They were talking about street lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Is that an interaction with KUB or is that something an MRS Code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| That was not one of the MRS Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Jim, reaching for the microphone, can talk better to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| But that was expressly left out of the MRS Code project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| And, frankly, I don't remember why at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Now we're pursuing that, I guess, as an additional saving place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| The street lighting falls under KUB, and we are working with KUB on street lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| Sort of LED type stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Further questions for Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Mr. Walsh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| So for Parks and Recreation budget, if you'll turn to page 9 on the handout and also in capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| he has several of those starting on page 10 of the capital handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| Jim Walsh, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Before I talk about Parks and Recreation, I want to give Boyce's business breakfast a plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| I've attended that event every year and we've had a lot of good connections with vendors, local vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| We've done a lot of business with people I've met at these facilities or at these breakfasts that have done business with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| to do things like strike parking lots, pressure wash restrooms, things like that that we weren't aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| So it's been very beneficial for our department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| Parks and Recreation, our proposed budget that you're considering is $7,327,420.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:23| That's an approximate 3.7% increase over the current year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| Parks and Recreation, we've got 57 permanent employees, 46 full-time and 11 part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| We're broken down into administration, athletics, recreation, aquatics and music and arts and crafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:49| We also employ several hundred temporary part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Those are your bus drivers, your umpires, field workers, lifeguards, which we're in the process of getting in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| Pool's open this Saturday and will be open until Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| We employ a lot of people on a temporary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| As you are well aware, just to brief you, Parks and Recreation, we manage 65 parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| about 2,000 acres of property, 13 recreation centers, 50 ball fields that are encompassed within 12 ball parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| two golf courses, 50 tennis courts, four dog parks, two skate parks, five swimming pools, three indoor, two outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:37| We're also heavy into various programs and special activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Just a couple weekends ago, we completed our fourth annual Let's Move event at Victor Ash Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| where we had about 2,000 kids and family members being active and interacting with about 90 different activity stations within the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:54| That was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| We also have a community band, which you always hear play every year at the mayor's budget luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| We work with Golden Gloves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| We have a summer playground program, so we're going to gear it up here in about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| It's a nine-week program where we enroll about 1,000 kids throughout the city at our various recreation centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| At that program, we have a one-time charge of $20 for the summer, and that's been going on for decades, long before I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:25| We also have our nontraditional sports program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| We do an annual step show, a teen step show at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| I mentioned after-school program, senior high-rise program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| So we're pretty much across the board program-wise, working with a lot of different partners like KCDC, CAC, Animal Youth Foundation, Boys and Girls Club, groups like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:50| Some of our major accomplishments these last 12 months, including a new recycling program, working with public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:59| We now have not only new trash receptacles in all of our parks and recreation centers, but we also implemented a recycling program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| So that's been full swing for about nine months and doing very well, we think, in most parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| We've implemented just last December, working with the Animal Youth Foundation, a learn-to-swim program at the Dr. E.D. Davidson Recreation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| where they're teaching about 300 kids so far, since they started the program, to swim, utilizing that pool, which is part of a lease agreement we have with Emerald Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:32| We've also hosted various youth and sports tournaments, state and national tournaments, both in sports of tennis and softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:43| In this room right here, just a few months ago, we hosted a youth sports celebration luncheon, where we recognized volunteer coaches throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| various sports, football, baseball, basketball, soccer, etc., and thanked them for all the work they do in making Knoxville a great place to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2931)|
| 0:49:01| Other activities or accomplishments from this past year, including building a new playground, working with Amuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| We had the ribbon-cutting back in December, and I think it was about 12 below zero that day, but it was really cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| It was a great partnership, working with Amuse and our public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| We got a grant from Kaboom and built that really nice playground, and it's been doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Not only services the people at Joe Howie Park who come to Amuse, but also the community around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| It's been a very, very well-used playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| We're also opening up a new playground this summer at Dr. E.D. Davidson Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| That's one of the only recreation centers that doesn't have a playground, so we're in the process of, we've got the purchase order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| and we'll be installing that in the next 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| A couple more things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| We're continuing our Greenways Feasibility Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| We've been working on that for about 18 months, working with Ross Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| They've been looking at 12 different possible greenway corridors throughout the city, and they've been giving us information slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| We should have all that completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| They've been working with our greenways coordinator, Lori Gerlich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| We should have that full report back in the next couple months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| and we would hope to be able to have a session with council where we can review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| and talk about what they see are the pros and cons of different corridors, the cost of possible construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| and then some of the engineering problems and maybe land acquisition problems associated with those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| So that's pretty much, in a nutshell, what we're up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Councilman Wallace, I was out at Knoxville Municipal Golf Course this morning and went around the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| We are 95 percent complete on resurfacing the cart paths at both Whittle Springs and Knoxville Municipal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| So that was a program that council was gracious enough to fund out of the late funding we got just a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:51| and it's so much better at those two golf courses with the new cart paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| because the other cart paths were really in very poor condition, as you probably know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| So I'm open for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Joe, you talked briefly about the greenways, and you mentioned the Ross Fowler study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| which has been going on for a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| I think there's a million dollars in this budget and a million dollars last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Are we building any greenways at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Can we not pluck one out of a list and start working on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Well, I think we are that close to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| We've got three or four that we feel good about, and I'm not going to go into those right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| I'll let the mayor talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| But we are right now, greenway-wise, we're about 95 percent complete with the Knox Blount Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| out there along the river on the south side of the Bucks Horns Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| So we should be having a ribbon-cutting there in the month of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| And I think engineering is about ready to bid out the First Creek Greenway from Fulton High School over to Edgewood Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| That's a project that was funded about a year and a half ago through Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| and we hope to start construction there sometime this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| So we've got those two, but we do hope to be able to bid at least one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| if not two, or get two in the works of those 12 corridors that we're under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| Are you doing any more with groups like the Bike Coalition or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| that we're doing volunteer label to make forest-type trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| Right, yeah. Now, I've been mostly talking about paved trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Right. These are more of the dirt tracks or the jerk tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Yeah, we call them natural surface trails, multi-use trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| The Appalachian Mountain Bike Club, which did such a great job on the urban wilderness loop, building all those trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| they've been working pretty diligently the last few months up at Sharps Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| They've built, last time I met with Brian Hand, about seven miles of mountain bike-slash-multi-purpose trails in Sharps Ridge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:47| So those are already being well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| We haven't really publicized them much recently, but that's something that's coming up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| We're working with them right now at Mary Vestal Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| They're working on a trail extension in that park that will be a soft-surface trail as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| So those are easier to build. As you know, they're less expensive to construct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| That's a good shot in the arm for the system because it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Yeah, it helps. And we're looking at working with our public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| who has done an occasional trail for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| We're looking at building a trail with that Mary Vestal Park, a paved trail, over to the South Nossel Community Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| and then on over to what I consider downtown Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| So there's about a half-mile section of trail that I'm working with David Brace on to hopefully build sometime this year in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| So we are slowly but continuously thinking about greenways and trying to add to our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| All right, thank you. Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Yeah, I'm glad to hear about the playground at E.V. Davidson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| Is that going to be ready this summer, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| Yes, sir. We're working with public service to get it prepped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| but we've already got a contract with a vendor and he should be installing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| probably with starting work in the next four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Also at E.V. Davidson, I think, is it open now for the general public, the pool, on Saturdays, a pass-by, solve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:10| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Do you know? I don't know if you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| I met with Shara Shoup. She's with Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| We met the day before yesterday and talked briefly about the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| But they are opening up more and more to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Initially, their plan was just to bring in children from their program and teach them to swim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| but there's been such a wave of enthusiasm and desire for adult swimming lessons and opening up more communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| So they are having at least one evening a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| and I think this summer they are planning on having more programs that will be open to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| Okay. And every year, you know, I always ask you about Harriet Tubman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| The Tennis Association always asks me, since that's in my district, for some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:55| You have about, I think, one porta potty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| That basketball court is heavily used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Well, it's the tennis court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Well, both tennis courts and basketball courts are well used in that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| Although it's a small park, it's a busy park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Being right there next to Vine Middle School certainly helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| Was any money in your budget for any improvements in the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| Not in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Now, we will continue to do things like, just this past year, replaced all the windscreens on the tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| I'm not sure what the cost of that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| It was several thousand, $4,000 or $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| And, of course, those tennis courts are in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| We've worked on the lighting, of course, as you know, because you've been involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| But as far as restroom facilities, we still, like many of our other parks, we've sort of utilized the Port-au-Jean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| That's sort of a last resort for those people who are in the park that don't want to go home and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Joe, can you explain more in the capital that says $1 million for Greenway Corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| what the notes were that it's for branding of the urban wilderness and development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| How was that split out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| It's just $100,000 or the $1 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| The $1 million is for Greenway Corridors, and that's in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Within the operating budget, there's $100,000 for branding of the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| I've got that mislabeled then because I've got it in the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| From the narrative comments, I put that under the capital project instead of in the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| So I can explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| The $1 million, of course, is what Councilman Della Volpe referenced in that as capital money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| you go toward future construction of a Greenway trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| The $100,000, which is in our operating budget, that's money to develop a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| Of course, as you know, we've got the urban wilderness corridor, which is well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| But we also have facilities like Iams Nature Center, William Hastie Park, Fort Dickerson Park, Mary Vestal Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| We've got the River Bluff property that Legacy Parks, I think, is planning on donating to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| You've got High Ground Park, which is an Aslan Foundation Park there in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| We just feel like there needs to be a lot more uniformity to this park system because they can all be tied together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| and that's the future plan is to have trails and corridors that connect this whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| And we feel like it's really important to work with organizations like Legacy and Iams and Aslan Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| and come together and make sure that we're branding these in such a way that you don't feel like you're going to separate parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| but it's all one system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| So that's in our operating budget for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| I guess sort of on the greenways, it looked like in the bicycle plan that includes greenways as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Is the greenway plan starting to mesh up with the overall bicycle plan, and how is that going to be handled moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| Are they still going to come from separate budgets, or has that been addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| It's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| I do know Lori, our greenways coordinator, works closely with John Shepstead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| and they talk about the bike trails versus the greenway trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| but I don't think the funding necessarily, anything related to bike paths, is in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| That's in the engineering budget, the bicycle infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Yeah, but in the bicycle plan there are some greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| Aren't proposals for new greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Not in the bicycle infrastructure plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| The one that was presented, did it include greenways, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| We'll let Jim Hagerman answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| I can't address it really specifically because I remember that there were some fairly highly prioritized greenway connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:46| but that's going to be a cooperative, interactive thing between us and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| The emphasis in the bike infrastructure plan was on street transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| and there's sort of not a really sharp distinction between transportation and recreation, but there is some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:10| So there's a fuzzy line, and we'll work together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| To me, in terms of whole mobility, looking at the city, it makes perfect sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| if you've got greenways, to utilize those and try to link them all up so people on bikes can move around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| That, to me, makes total sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| It's just in terms of budgets, if they're coming out two different pots, it makes it a little more challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| In terms of budgets, I'm sure we'll both be trying to leverage the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| Well, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Joe, the workout at West Hills Park, that's under this year's budget, right, where the old tennis courts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| and they're putting in the new fields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| And when's that going to be underway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Aaron Browning is coordinating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| He's our athletic coordinator, but I think the contract's been let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| We're waiting for the contract to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| So we should have a signed contract because Council approved it a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| So that work should start sometime this summer, probably in June, I would hope in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| And when's it to be finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| 45 to 60 days on that, so probably end of July, first of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| So the mayor and I need to learn to play that game by then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Aaron is our resident expert, so if you want lessons, just Aaron Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| You can look him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| I think we're both going to need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Hey, Joe, remind me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| I was trying to find the trailhead, if you will, that will take us out to the naval base on Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| Where will you gain entrance to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| There will be several entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| That's one great thing about this trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| As you go into the UT property, there are several connections that come into the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| But the trailhead, really, probably would start over on the north side of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| where an alien greenway ties in, goes across the Buckharnes Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| They've got a separated pedestrian bike corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| And once you cross the bridge, then you would circle down under the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| and go all the way to the Marine Naval Station and to that county park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| Really, I guess the county park there, just south of the Marine Naval Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| will be the trailhead if you're coming from the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| And from the north, it could be Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| It could be at Calhoun's, just depending on how far you want to ride your bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| But there is no true trailhead at the beginning of the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| but rather it just connects to the bridge crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| I'm still confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| If you come all the way, and that's where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| I was on the mainland, and I went over to the old faculty club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| I forget what UT calls it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| So where would you pick it up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| On the other side of the street from the old faculty club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| The trail goes up like you're going toward Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| And then it just loops back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| In their parking lot at the bottom, at their parking lot there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| On the other side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Other side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Yes, down at the parking lot where the pool was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Like you're actually there, and you go across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| You go across Buckharnes Bridge on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| and then it loops back underneath the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| I'm just going to see if a man might be able to get on a little early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| I'll take you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I had a conversation with Chris Burkhart yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| He's the contractor who's building that particular greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| That's pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| He's done a great job completing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| It's already 95% complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| but the last section underneath the South Knoxville Bridge was held up for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| because we had to change the layout of the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| and we had to go back to Nashville and ask the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| to give us the necessary paperwork to allow us to shift the original agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| So that took a while, but we've got that agreement in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| and Chris is going to remobilize and complete that last little section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| Trustee Melville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| I see in the capital budget you've got $2.1 million for Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| and that's in a string of lots of dollars going to Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Is there going to come a time when some of those resources go to other parts of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| instead of the wonderful park at Lakeshore that everyone likes and enjoys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| but might want something closer to their home turf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| I would hope so, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| I'll be asking for, I'm sure, money next year in another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| But, you know, you were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| It's a beautiful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| We've completed the demolition of the 20 buildings that were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| as a result of the abandonment of a mental health institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| and those are all removed, and it's a beautiful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I know working with the Lakeshore Park Board there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| they're doing a backup job raising private money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| and I think it's just what we're doing now is once we've completed the demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| we're going to get the utilities running there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| KEB is working right now to water, sewer, gas, electric into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| And then the private money will take over some of the amenities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| In fact, they've already started work on their first playground project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| which was a $2.5 million playground project they've already started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| and I think they've got plans to spend another $13 million the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| Are you studying parks in other parts of the city that are going to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| or improved as this is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| Oh, yeah, constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| We've got 65 parks, and they're all important, and they're all a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| and we're going to keep them all in good shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| and make improvements as to as many as we can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Councilman Wallace, I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| So we can keep this fight going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| I want to recognize Councilman Grieve of the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| I just want to emphasize to my colleague that Lakeshore is a city park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| a highly used city park by everyone all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| not only the city but also the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| So, Mr. Dellavopia, I want to make sure that you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| I'm not going to touch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| But on that track, I mean, with the numbers going across here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| it would be $9.3 million to Lakeshore, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| And that's the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| So with the $5.2 million in 2014 and $2 million last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| and then another $2.1 million right now, is that what we're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| It's $11.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| It was amended and adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| So what's the total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Oh, amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| It is what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| $9.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| It was $2 million for utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| The renovation of the admin building has been more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| than probably what we had anticipated originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| and we know that that's a building that's most definitely worth preserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| and restoring for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| And, of course, the demolition came in under budget, so that was really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| So we do have some extra funds in there to hopefully do a few more things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| But as Joe said, really this is one of those examples of where you invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| public dollars to try to motivate additional private and public funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| And as Joe said, we know that Lakeshore Park is right now at about $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| that they're going to be putting into phase one of the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| of that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| And I'll make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| I've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| In my term since I've been in Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| we've built brand-new parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| We've built Holston River Park and Victor Ashe Park and Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:12| And they're all expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| It's expensive to build parks, but it's certainly a great asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I think Caswell Park has been open 10 years now, Holston River about 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| Victor Ashe about eight or nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| But this Lakeshore Park, 170 acres of pristine property that will be a destination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| for not only all residents of Knoxville, but people from all over the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| will want to come there and participate in what they'll have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| I don't disagree with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| It's the prettiest park around, and there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| And since those buildings came down, it's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| I don't question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| I think that it's going to be expensive office space for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| Is that going to be $2 million into that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Is that mostly what that 2.1 is going for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| The building that was built in 1884, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| was the original administration building at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| The state was using it up until the day they moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| But it is in need of some serious renovation work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| and we've done about absolutely everything we know to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| to try to keep the cost under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| But whenever you get into a building like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| there's always things you're unaware of until you start taking walls apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| and looking at systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| But we felt like it was important that we preserve that particular structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| One is just to commemorate what happened at that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| and what that place was about for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| But it will be another space that we hope that the public can use on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| We'll have some community space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| And Parks and Recreation will have a strong contingency of staff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| I think that's going to be important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| to be open to the community some way, somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| It's a gruesome, ugly reminder, too, of what has gone on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| So that's a tough deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| If it were me, I would have seen some of the historic preservation money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| that's allocated elsewhere being allocated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| I mean, it's a lot of money you put into historic preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| would be my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| That and another half a million in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| Lakeshore is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| Joe, you can see the thing shifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| I can remember when you had no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| I'm glad to see people are interested in parks and recreation facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| I'm prejudiced, but I think it's a really important part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| So I appreciate your ongoing support of our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| Mr. Ahrens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| To pick up Fund 216, the City Inspections Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| it's on page 21 at the bottom of the page on the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| I'm Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| We have a staff of 29 full-time inspectors and office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| Some of the highlights from the previous year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| we've implemented pre-submittal conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| which is an opportunity for developers and builders in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| and even out of town to come in and collaborate with not only city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| but we collaborate with KUB and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| everybody that they'll deal with in the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| just to get on the same page ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| work out some issues before they get too far down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| Another highlight, we collaborated with city staff and MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| in creating some form-based district administrative revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| which hopefully you'll be seeing in the near future come before you in council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| which provides an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| The form-based codes were designed and developed really for new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| as opposed to all of the existing structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| and so this is an opportunity where we can help facilitate redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| and improving those districts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| We've had several large projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| which resulted in increased revenues for the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| but also increased inspection numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| Some of those projects include the Children's Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| Medical Arts Building, and several residential projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| which include Riverside Apartments, Marble Alley, the standard on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| We are internally continuing to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| towards combination building inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| which that's different than the past in that once we're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| if you've got a project that's regulated by the residential code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| you'll have a one-stop shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| You won't have to coordinate four or five different inspectors for your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| These new combination inspectors will be able to perform all of the related inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| not only building, but all the trades inspections as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| We've reorganized our zoning division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| You've graciously allowed us to hire another zoning inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| We've got a zoning chief in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| and we've just hired another zoning inspector to replace the sign inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| who just retired a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| So we're doing all of that in anticipation of taking a more proactive approach in zoning enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| whether it be signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| We're looking to collaborate with the Historic Zoning Commission to help work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| and try and spread out the proactive approach amongst all areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| And finally, we're just really adjusting to an aging staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| We've got two new chief inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| We've got a new plumbing mechanical chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| We've got a new electrical chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| And we've got several that are on the drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| and we anticipate more retirements in the upcoming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| So if you have any questions, I'll be happy to pick up where Joe started with very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| I'm teasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| I just want to thank Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Your office has been very responsive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| and we've tried, I guess, as council people to include you in on some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| that maybe would be done more by staff so you would know what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| And we appreciate the responsiveness of your staff and you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| and we have questions or concerns because there's always neighbors that are unhappy about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| Sure. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| We appreciate you handling those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Any further questions from Mr. Aaron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| If not, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Mr. Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Fleet Services Fund is on page 31 of the handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| and also in your capital listing it's pages three and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| It's on two different pages split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| What was that first page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| The page in the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| The handout is page 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Good timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| On time inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Keith Shields, Director of Fleet Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| This past year we've had quite a few accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I'm going to just summarize a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| We successfully transitioned over to the Dodge Charger patrol car for the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| We have 25 more cars on order, and, in fact, I think some of them may have arrived today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| so we'll be upfitting those, getting those ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| We also purchased and placed into service a Dodge Ram 2500 CNG gasoline pickup truck this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| to test the effectiveness of compressed natural gas, how it performs in our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| and whether or not it's a viable option in the future for our larger vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| We also converted three lawnmowers over to propane this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| That does quite a few things for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| It's quite a bit cheaper, and also it's better for the environment because when you think about the lawnmowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| there's no emission control on those at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| so everything they blow out is not controlled like a motor vehicle is, like a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| With all the emission control features, you don't have that on the lawnmowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| We've also installed 99 of the automatic vehicle location systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| I think Janet may have discussed that earlier this morning with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| so we're pleased with the results of those, the data we're getting, and the information we receive from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:43| Going forward, we will continue to emphasize and stress safety as it relates to our team members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| and also to our facilities and the CIP purchases we make to make their jobs safer and more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:59| Training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| We will continue to invest in our team members to be sure that we provide safety training, skill training, proficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:09| and also try to keep up with technology as it changes so quickly as it deals with motor vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| and everything else we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| It's a never-changing event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| It's much like your cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| By the time you think you're up to date, the new one comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| We're continuously trying to update our technicians and their skill sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| so that we can maintain the Knoxville pieces of equipment that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| What questions do you have about fleet services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| I don't want to be redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| I asked a question earlier, and Jim York answered it, but he said that you would probably be more able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| My question was about electric cars, and was that feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| Is it time to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Since you're here, I'm going to ask it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Yes, sir, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| We have some of our fleet pool vehicles that are coming up for replacement that we're going to repurpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| in other areas of the city because those are the vehicles that go out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| so we always want to be sure we have them under warranty so that if there is a breakdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| we can get them worked on and taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| We are looking at the LEAF and the VOLT for the city pool vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| or even assigning them to some departments, but we have to be real specific about which departments get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| The LEAF has a certain amount of range per day that you can go out and run around town in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| so we have to be cognizant of that fact that we don't put it on an inspector who may run 200 miles a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| and at 80 miles, they're on the side of the road trying to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| We're looking at some specific applications there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| The VOLT gives us the best of both worlds in that it's gasoline and hybrid electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| It has about a 40-mile range on the battery in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| and then it switches over to gasoline the rest of the day, so there's pros and cons with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| There's also some cold weather anxiety up north, and they're still looking at some of the battery technology there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| It keeps improving much like everything else in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| But the battery range is getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| The technology is getting better on the battery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| so hopefully the range will get better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| but we will look at getting one of those to maybe try out in a specific application to see how it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| This might be more for the chief of police than you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| but they were talking earlier about changing out computers to tablets, putting in printers and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:37| and I was just wondering, you had mentioned safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| How many things can a police officer do before he gets distracted with the perp in the car in front of him or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| In other words, is there some concern about operational safety or efficiency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| I think there always has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| If you have distracted driving, regardless of where you are in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| whether you're driving a pool vehicle, a public works vehicle, whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| you have to be cognizant of that fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| and there are, I believe, interlock devices you can put on that when maybe the tablet is up, you can't run the engine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| But certainly we'll leave that to KPD to do their training out at the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| That's actually how we're going to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| When they're out for their training, we'll be at the track installing those devices in their vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| and I believe they'll be going through training then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| But there certainly is some visibility that the tablet needs to be folded down when driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| so it doesn't block the officer's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| But I'll leave that to Chief Roush and how they want to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| It should be much like the laptops they have now, the rules they have for using those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| and when they can use them and when they can't use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Appreciate it. Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| I brought the engineering management team with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| Jeff Branham, some of you may not have met yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| He's Chief of Traffic, and he just completed his first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| Steve King seems to have stepped out for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Tom Clabo, Chief of Civil Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| Brent Johnson of Stormwater, who I'm sad to say is ending his career at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| and moving on here very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| And Administrative Assistant Robin Hodges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| So if you all stump me, I'll have backup here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| Can I just tell them where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| You're on page 8 of the handout, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| And then also page 5 of the capital printout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| As you go around town, you probably run into a few detours and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| So you know that we're out there improving infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| Right now, well, the outcome should be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| The process may not be as convenient for everybody as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| I mean, as we might hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| But currently in process, we have Cross Park Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| and West Lund Drive drainage projects going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| We have resurfacing all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| We're working on Fountain City Lake improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| In cooperation with redevelopment, we're working on Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| Marble Alley downtown, River's Edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| Country Landing Park and its associated streets on the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| We're wrapping up wayfinding in cooperation with Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| We're working on Fort Dickerson, finishing up those golf cart paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| that Joe mentioned, also finishing up Knox Greenway, as he mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| and Lakeshore demolition that he mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| We just finished a major drainage project on Prosser Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| new sidewalks on Montview Road, Esri Drive, Myrtle Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| and Wilder Place and Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| And we're about to start projects on the Holbrook bridge replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| First Creek Greenway is about to get bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| We have a package of sidewalks in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| We're all looking forward to shutting down Gay Street to do the 700 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| We have the traffic signal modernization process that's just about to kick off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| a new parking meter demonstration downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and a sign inventory that's a citywide process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| We have a lot more of that sort of stuff in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| And, of course, those visible projects are like just the top of the iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| We have a great deal of activity going on developing those pipeline projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| as well as the basic operations of traffic signs and signals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| water quality, drainage projects throughout town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| So we're all very busy, and I think we're doing great things for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| For this budget, most of the budget goes to ongoing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:34| The significant new items in the capital budget are an item for sign replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:42| which is a follow-up to the sign inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| There are federal retro-reflectivity standards that we are required to survey our signs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| and replace those that don't meet the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| and we're anticipating that that's going to cost a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| The vendors who have courted us in the past said they're finding about 10% of signs do not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:12| in communities they've done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| So we have about 50,000 signs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| Something like 5,000 signs we'll need to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| There's also money in the budget to do construction of the old Broadway sidewalk connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| Last year we got design funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| This year we have construction funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| And the amount that was allocated for bicycle infrastructure was increased up to $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| That's a program that's really just getting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| but the infrastructure plan really kicked that into a position where we're doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:58| We have a plan, so we can spend that money in the most effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:08| Did that cover it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| Do you have any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Jim, the advanced traffic management system and the traffic signal modernization program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:24| in my mind they sound very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| Tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| There is some overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| Part of the time we've been calling the traffic signal modernization line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| traffic signal maintenance, which is more accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| and some of the documents we've got kicking around say maintenance rather than modernization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| but it really is maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| We've not been keeping up on investment in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| and to a large extent that line item gets used for the short-term fixes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5094)|
| 1:25:02| the failures and the places where we just really need some more performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| The bigger picture planning process, which is the ATMS, should mesh with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:19| It should be complementary, but the maintenance is really the shorter-term operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:29| Okay, so in the ATMS, I assume that's our traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:38| That's the real modernization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Where are we in that process, and when is it going to be complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| We have selected a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| Is the contract done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| So it has been signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| Okay, the contract is all the way through the steps within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| As soon as that gets finalized, the mayor signs off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| It's got to go through purchasing and law and signed off by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| There will be a kickoff meeting, and that will get all the stakeholders involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| and let everybody know what the real scope is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| It will probably be three years before that is designed and installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:31| About the first year to year and a half will be mostly up-front consultant design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| Bear in mind that this is the first phase, and that first phase is already funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| So this $500,000 is going into a pot to accumulate towards the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:55| Did that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Will that be the final phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| In other words, when are we going to see traffic flowing more smoothly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| Well, it will be moving more smoothly incrementally as we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| but the first phase will address probably three major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| So you'll be able to see some real differences after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| You'll also have some of the infrastructure in place for the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| The real emphasis on the ATMS project is communications between the signals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| up the corridor, and back to the people who do the maintenance and the operations center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| So all of the hardware won't necessarily be replaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| and the maintenance budget gets hit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| So it is a big system that we could spend a whole lot more money than this on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| but the first three years is going to make a big difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| particularly to the high-priority corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| So walk me back through this just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| When are the various phases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| When is the first phase going to be complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| In about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Oh, that's the first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| That's the first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| And that's just three corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| But some of them could be big corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| We haven't selected them for sure yet, but Broadway, Kingston Pike are great candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:27| But, you know, that's a lot of signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| That's a big chunk of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| I believe I saw somewhere, and I may be incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| is there a new position for a parking meter technician?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| And is that to, I guess, talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Is that to help implement the parking meter upgrade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| and is that position supposed to be filled in perpetuity, or does it have a time limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| It is a permanent position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| I'm sure there's going to be some flexibility with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| There will be some enforcement duties, and our real enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| our overall enforcement strategy is still under discussion internally about how we really want to push that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| So just having a we've been so inconsistent with enforcement throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| that having just a little more help, one additional person or part of four additional people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5363)|
| 1:29:32| we're sort of sticking our one toe in the water to see how it goes to have some enforcement capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| within the meter department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| And with the money last year and this year, I guess how many meters do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| and how many are going to be upgraded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Do you have an idea on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| I'm sorry, I've forgotten how many meters there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| 1,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| 1,400 meters throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| They are all going to get replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Okay, so it's a total overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| We're going to start the first phase is downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| The second phase is Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| And the third phase is miscellaneous distributed throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| Meanwhile, we're going to look at the places where they're actually getting used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| and figuring out if we can leave some of them out, add some more, shuffle them around some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| We're going to end up with about the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Yes, we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Yeah, Jim, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| How much money do we bring in a year on parking meters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Right now, my recollection is about $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Because of inconsistent enforcement and low prices compared to other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:53| we can do a lot better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| I was going to say, so you feel the investment we're putting into the new meters will end up making money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| I couldn't get support from him if it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| To expand on that, we're going to review everything in regards to parking meters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| the locations of where they could go, where they should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Some are not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Other areas could use a parking meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| And so we're going to be reviewing the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| As Jim said, we have a pilot program where we're testing out three different vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| and these are going to be advanced parking meters, of course, that can take more than just cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| Okay, got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| And I might note that by ordinance, engineering has most of the responsibility for meters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| but that puts us ñ it doesn't make any sense for us to do it in a silo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| We've got to have interaction with the administration, with the citizens, with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| to make sure that we're going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| Because you put some in last year that were new, right, or a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| Those are also demonstrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Okay, those are demonstrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| And we went back to the ñ I think we sort of went down the wrong path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| and I've got to take responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| By doing those demonstrations, it really didn't get us closer to having meters out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| What we had to do is go back and do an official request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| and build the demonstration into that RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| and then we can use the information we gather from the demonstration to choose the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| Jim, there's about a million dollars in bicycle infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| and I know you've been working on the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Is most of that money going to go to, like, bicycle lanes for roads you are improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| or building from scratch, or is it more towards retrofitting existing roadbed, if that makes sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| It's going to be almost exclusively retrofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| The improvements that go in on the new road will be in part in the budget of the new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| You'll just budget a complete street for a new road that has sidewalks and bicycles and cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| And we're also looking at opportunities for re-striping as we go through the resurfacing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| That doesn't go out of the – I mean, that's essentially no cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| so it doesn't come out of the bike infrastructure line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5608)|
| 1:33:35| When we had a meeting on the Magnolia Corridor design engineer maybe a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| I remember some bicycle enthusiasts saying, look, if I just got a, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| a three-foot lane alongside the cars, I'm going to be eating rocks being kicked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| or being afraid of being clipped, and that wasn't particularly safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| And they wanted either some separation or to be on a parallel side road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| How did you address that idea of safety or comfort of safety kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| That is an ongoing design question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| Every time we do this, we've got to figure out how much room we've got to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| how much room we have to work with, and what kind of facility we can get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| There's a real strong tendency in the 20 teens to go to a separated facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:33| Unfortunately, most of the time in Knoxville, we're very limited on right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| so that's not really a viable option in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| So is shared road kind of the message of the day in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| Shared road is a necessity for us, and a separated facility is the way things are headed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| but it's sort of a luxury from our perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| If we had extra lanes to shut down, we could go with separated facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| but there are not very many roads where we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| In the case of Magnolia, the amount of traffic on that road normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:14| you could justify shutting down lanes and making it a three-lane cross section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| instead of a five-lane cross section, and then you'd have a lot of room to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| But it's a TDOT road, and TDOT sees that as an alternative route for shutting down the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:30| which happens, and it does get interstate traffic when there's a problem on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:37| So that's a reasonable concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| Constantly balancing all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| Very briefly, back to the parking meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| What role does public building authority play in either enforcing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| Maybe I need to ask Chief Roush that. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Public building authority currently does the enforcement on Gay Street where there are no meters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5755)|
| 1:36:03| and so they're out there marking tires to enforce the two-hour time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| There may be a bigger role for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| That's still under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Yeah, they also manage the garages, city garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| But that is part of the policy discussion that we're having internally now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| is how we want to handle parking enforcement in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| whether it should be handled in engineering, PBA, or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:34| Jim, walk me through from I know what's going to take place out on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| in terms of the sidewalks and bicycle lanes and everything with the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| What's being done as far as connecting Adair to that area and then from that area into town in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| Is that considered under part of the Greenway or is it considered part of your bike program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| How does that all tie together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| What we have funding for now is just sidewalks for the length of Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| It would run from the south intersection of Broadway south of 640 up to Adair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:11| Just sidewalks, not considering bikes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| Yeah, well, there's very limited cross-section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| There's a lot of discussion with TDOT about trying to get some kind of bike facility in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| We're still going to explore squeezing something else in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| but there is a lot of traffic going in various directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| So the bikes may have to live with riding on the sidewalk or whatever else we can hook up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:43| But, yeah, that's certainly a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| The design process is just getting kicked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| The design process is just starting, so it's pretty much a blank piece of paper at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| How about the connections north and then south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| Well, to Adair, it does go all the way to – does it go all the way to Adair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| It does not go all the way to Adair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| It just goes to Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| So there is a Greenway connection under consideration that would get you to Adair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| And I don't know how far that proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| As far as coming into town, you have to weave your way through roads, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| Yeah, and there is – it would be fairly easy to get onto the existing signed route from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:32| and we would probably add some additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| All right, we need to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| We're starting to fall a little bit behind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| Mr. Harriman, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| And Ms. Dissler, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| So the cap budget starts in the handout on page 29 in Fund 507,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| and then the other component of it is the grant match that's included in the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| and that grant match money went from $717,000 last year to $699,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:05| I'm Dawn Dissler, Director of Transit, and I have Melissa Roberson here with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| my Chief Administrative Officer, in case I decide to tie my tongue or strip over anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| It's hard for me to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| I think I'm still the new kid on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| So it's not been quite a year, but almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| And CAT has had a really successful fiscal year for 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| We've continued with ridership increases and also system growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| And one of the best parts for me has been getting to know everybody in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| and working with the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| And I think we've done a pretty good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| We've worked with Parks and Rec, and I think one of the big things there was Everly Park in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| and that's just a great example of a multimodal area that has three bus routes going through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| It has greenway connections, sidewalks, transit enhancements like benches and shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| and just about every route in our system actually connects to either a city park or a greenway or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| which I think is pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| And working with engineering on sidewalks and lighting, also working with public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| David Brace has been great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| He's one of the main reasons we were able to keep buses running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| when everybody else shut down when there was snow and ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| So I really appreciate everybody working with CAT and with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| CAT is also part of that working with different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Working with redevelopment, we're pleased to also work with our KTA board, which Mayor Brown is a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| and we get to offer the free fare zone with Cumberland Avenue beginning on June 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| and we're pretty excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| I think everybody here actually got an e-mail today on that from my group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| And the free fare zone is intended to attract new riders to transit during the construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| It's also going to let the public know that Cumberland Avenue is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| It's not shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| The merchants are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| And the best way to get to Cumberland and through Cumberland is to be on a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| There's no sense in honking your horn and fighting and sitting there and getting all upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| when you can be sitting on a bus texting or playing games on your iPad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| or whatever it is you're using and want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| So also with that, we encourage all of you, if you want, to come ride with me one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| and we'll go to lunch out on Cumberland and we'll take the bus out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| It won't cost you a dime if we do it after June 1st because you can go for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| Our service plan, which I know is part of the mayor's budget for the upcoming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| that involves continuing to carefully and methodically expand transit service for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| We have begun this process during this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| and we've done that by creating some service efficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| which allowed us to add additional evening service to three neighborhood-based routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| which is the Burlington, the South Knoxville, and the Vestal route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| And we're hoping to continue that additional service with our Cedar Bluff Connector services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| with this upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| And then also we want to expand Sunday service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| Our Sunday service is probably the weakest link that we have here at CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| and that's because there's only four core routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| They don't start until after 10 o'clock in the morning, and they're done by 6 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| And what we're looking for is expanding those hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| and allowing for additional opportunities for people who live and come play in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| to go to worship services on Sundays, to go to work on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| There's a lot of people out there that work in the service industry on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| And then also be able to shop and come downtown and enjoy the things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| And that, we're hoping, will help us to expand from 8.15 in the morning until 8.15 at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| which we think is going to really continue to up the ridership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| One of the things that I thought was really neat when I was looking over some different numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| is we actually are providing a million more rides a year than we were 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| And that's pretty cool when you think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| That's a lot of rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| That's a lot of people using public transit, and that is only growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| We now have what they call, I call it from the young folks to the old folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| We have the millennials who don't want to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| I've got nieces and nephews that are 30 years old that don't have driver's licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| I mean, that was the first thing I wanted to do when I could get a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| These folks, no, they're taking the bus everywhere they go because you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| They don't want to put down their phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| They're constantly texting and looking at stuff on their phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| and they'd rather get on a bus and go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| And then we have folks, the baby boomers, things like that, that are getting ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| And those folks, they want to stay where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| They want to stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| They want to grow old in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| And they know that at some point they're going to have to give up their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| and they know that it's a whole lot easier just to jump on a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| and get where they need to go and not have to worry about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| whether they're going too slow or not paying attention and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| Another big thing that I think is good that we've done is we're trying to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| four what we call super stops where routes can come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| People don't have to come all the way downtown to transfer to a route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| We have two of those super stops that are already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| That would be our west super stop and our north super stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| We have our east super stop, which is in the design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| and then we also have our south super stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| which we are just in the middle of identifying the right place to put that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| So we're pretty proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| We currently are running a system of about 100 vehicles altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| with our Lyft and our bus services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| And I guess with that, I'll see if any of the Christmas trees light up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| First of all, I want to thank what Cat's doing in the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| and also at the Everly Park, the new pocket park that we're putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| One of the questions that has come up is whether or not we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| a covered bus stop at that particular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| Apparently we have a number of people that do pick up one of the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| that run through there, so if we could look into having a covered top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| And then the question came up, are any of the bus stops, especially the covered ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| do you have any solar panels on top of any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| At this point, we do not have any solar bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| That is something that we're looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| We're looking into different enhancements that we can start to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| because I was at the bike conference that they had here with Gil Penaloso here talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| and he's exactly right when he talked about the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| is just as important as the ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| It's cool to have a bus that gets you where you're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| but if you're standing out, well, for here I know a lot of snow is like three inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| I come from the north where you get three feet of snow, that's a lot of snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| But folks still don't want to stand out in the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| They don't want to stand out in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| So we're going to be looking more into the different enhancements we can do for bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| Solar will be one of them, and we will be glad to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| I want to put a plug in for Everly Park because we're talking about the lighting for the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| and that was one of the things that came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| the possibility if we had solar panels on top of the bus stop that then we could use for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| So I wanted to bring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| The other thing I wanted to mention too, which I really appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| I have sent several people who have been complaining about the change of the bus routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| especially through the Sequoia area, to you, and I have not heard back from those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| So I assume that I want to thank you for taking care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| and it's obvious that they got the right kind of answer from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| So I appreciate the fact that we can send those folks to you and get the answers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| Move on to Dan first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Mayor Bryan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| You mentioned expansion of Sunday service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| Would that possibly include the CAT lift as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| You have a lot of seniors who are homebound, nursing homebound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| that could use that service since we're in the Bible Belt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| and a lot of them like to attend service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| South or north, a lot of people like to attend services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| So, yes, whenever we expand regular bus route service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| part of that expansion will be looking into the lift service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| and not only is it the right thing to do, it's also mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| So the ADA has us to provide the same type of complimentary service on the lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:43| for those people who qualify, the same hours within our lift area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| and we'll also be expanding that as we expand the bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Don, a year or more ago we got the GOBUS report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| and had that consultation by him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| and he mentioned in there that he thought we had too many buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| and we might be able to eliminate a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| and he also mentioned excessive parts and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| Have you seen that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Have you found that to be true, or have you studied that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| and has there been any movement on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| I can tell you myself that we have the exact right correct spare ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| for the amount of bus routes that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| The FTA allows you to have up to a 20% spare ratio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| and we actually are sitting at right at 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| which is what you really need to make sure that in case some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| You have to be able to take buses out of service to do preventative maintenance on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| This is not just for buses that break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| You want to make sure that you're keeping those buses safe and in good shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| one, so they last, two, so they give an enjoyable experience for folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| but also because that's the efficient thing to do with your money also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| make sure these vehicles are kept in good shape and keep using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| So I don't feel that we have too many vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| I think he identified too many employees maybe for subs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| or did Reno, for somebody who's out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| was that another area that he identified as a potential area to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| I was going from memory here, but you've looked at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| You feel like it's in order and it's in the national record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| We've actually looked over quite a few different areas since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| and the group is really good at doing a lot with a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| They really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| I was actually surprised at how much this group does for as small of an organization as they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| but as large of a service as they do provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| It's actually a very good service for the area that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| Yeah, Dawn, we were talking before about bikes and bike routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| and I'm just curious, what happens when an older gentleman like myself or Finbar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| wants to go, say, biking at Lakeshore, but they don't really want to ride all the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| Do you have provisions for how many bikes you can take as a passenger on the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| get there, have your recreation, and then go home exhausted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| We not only want you to be healthy, we want you to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| So, yeah, we have those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Every vehicle that we have that is in our fixed route line service has a bike rack on the front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| That bike rack can hold two bikes at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Two at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| But we also don't discourage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| As long as the bus isn't, like, packed or anything, it would be okay to bring the bike on the bus also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:54| So, yeah, we can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| The second question was we sat through the Urban Land Institute's presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:03| We heard folks commenting from parts of East Knoxville about what a shame it would be to, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:11| close the Coliseum or the auditorium there, and as a practical matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| it's set up where it's really close to the interstate, to James White Fork Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| It handles traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| It has great parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| Have you looked at increasing the service, say, an hour before and an hour after a show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| so that one of their concerns could be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| and that is people would come downtown and also to go to a show would also go to dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| and whatever without moving cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| In other words, is there some kind of service we can offer on show night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| that makes it really convenient to do two or three stops of activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| I think the best way to address that situation and the best way to look at service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| is to continue to expand the service as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| I don't think you just kind of look at a piece here and a piece there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| As you continue to make your service more frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| and we continue to make the service go longer into the night and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| people have to be able to rely on the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| They have to know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| So just like during the bad weather, the snow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| I can remember getting that phone call and saying, hey, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| What we do is we come to work and we drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| We might drive a little slower, might not drive on some of the back roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| but we're still providing the service so that people know they can rely on us and we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| And from that, we actually got a few riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| We had some people who rode during the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| That enables them to plan their trips because they know they can count on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| They know it's going to be some nights where there aren't as many people on a bus as other nights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| but as the city grows and you start to bring these folks to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| the folks that you want here to work in your city and live and play in your city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| these are the folks that are going to want to take the buses to the places they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Could I make one quick comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| I just want to, again, thank CAT for their hiring practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| They have hired many people who have made mistakes in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| and these people have become productive, taxpaying citizens, people who may have had a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:26| But CAT has an excellent record in hiring people, and I just wanted to compliment CAT on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:34| It set a good example with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| Mary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:50| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| I am Mary Bogert, general manager of the Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| With me today I have a few members of my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| I have Tom Conaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| He's our director of finance, and I have Rebecca Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| He's our director of sales and marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| The rest of the team is back in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| I hope you'll appreciate taking care of about 12,000 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| We have 17,000 attendees with DI in town, so it's a pleasure to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| Typically, I always give you all an update on the lay of the land for our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| We tend to be six months to a year behind the national trend as far as economy goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| Last year was a really tough year for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| If you'll recall, we pulled it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| We made our budget, but not without a lot of cutbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| and really watching our indirect expenses very tightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| We did have quite a significant reduction in our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| We lost several positions to attrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| We had layoffs, and we eliminated a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| So that was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| We made our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| The economy in our market has started to stabilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| We carried this cost savings initiative into the current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| and I'm pleased to tell you that we are on target to make our budget in the current fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| so that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Looking forward, bookings are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| Our team, along with the Visit Knoxville sales team, have been working hand-in-hand very, very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| better than ever in the past, and bookings are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| We're starting to see all that paying off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| So next year, just to give you an idea, we're up 30 event bookings already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| and that is a combination of our team and their team working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| Future bookings beyond that are looking even better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| So regarding our budget, it's relatively flat next year to this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| revenue is up about $160,000, so why is the budget flat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| Well, one of the things we're doing is we'd like to bring back a couple of the positions that we lost through attrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| We've got to be able to service this business that's going to be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| We're investing in a little additional training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Our wages and salaries, we've got a 2.5 increase budgeted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| Our cost of utilities per unit continue to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| Our usage isn't necessarily rising, but our cost per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| And then, of course, our medical benefits continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| Lastly, the other increase that you'll see is in our maintenance line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| The building's getting some age on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| We're spending more money to maintenance a lot of our equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| Other than that, we're real pleased and excited about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| We don't have any capital funding requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| Actually, our request for funding is about $4,000 less than it was in the current year, so it's relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:35| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:44| Are you seeing any change in the national level bookings as opposed to the local events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| In other words, are you getting more big out of town groups coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Because that was an issue as the economy went bad in 2008 and 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| That was a concern, but that's where you get the tourist dollars and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| That's why the facility was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| I mean, we love our filler business, but one of the things that affected us last year was we have so many new venues coming into the market that can do the local events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:19| And if you've been having your Christmas party at the convention center for 10 years, you might want to try something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:25| Rotating it around, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| So we did see that, and we knew that that was a trend that was likely to stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| That happened along the timing of Visit Knoxville, kind of taking over and kicking in, and the sales teams working so well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:42| And so that's been a great supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| We're out there booking exactly what that facility was built to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| One of the other things we're starting to see is a trend of us, for the very first time, being in a position to be very selective about the groups that we are booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7071)|
| 1:58:00| We're making choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| Do we take the 500-room-night piece of business versus a 2,000-room-night piece of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:10| Well, let's talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| This piece of business is going to be in town for five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| They're going to stay one person to a hotel room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| They're going to be out in the market spending a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| I shouldn't say room nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Let's say attendees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| These 2,000 attendees are probably going to stay four to a room, only be here for a couple of days and pack their coolers in and not eating out at restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| And eat peanuts they got on the plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| Well, we're able to be a little bit more selective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| We're starting to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| We're already in a scenario where our exhibition hall is booked January of 2015 all the way through May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:45| I don't have dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| So we're literally turning away business now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| My second question is what about the newness of the Nashville Convention Center that was hurting a bit a year ago because everyone wanted to try it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:58| Is that fading any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| It is fading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| A lot of our association business did go to Nashville and is slowly returning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| One of the things, and I'm going to be very PC, we do a really nice job of providing great customer service, making customers feel welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:13| We have a really good food and beverage team, and that's a lot of what we're hearing when being compared to other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| A big city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| A ruder big city like Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Well, we make people feel special when they come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| They're not a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| Let me call on Councilman Saunders here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| We really need to pick up the pace here a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| This shouldn't take but a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| It may not even be a question for you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| It may be for Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| It affects you, though, the viaduct, the walkway over the – where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| Is that thing kind of open or is it fully open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| The bridge is temporarily open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| We opened it and have it secured and safe for people to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| We wanted to make sure it was open for DI, for Freedom School, and then University Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| There were some camps there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| So because of those very large events, we wanted to make sure that it was open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| There's some other work on that bridge, but it's work that's not closing the structure at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| So it will be open for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| It will be closed again for us to finish the project, but not until DI and these other events are over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| I will also say that those upgrades are huge to us, and thank you all very much to the administration, all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| All those upgrades make us so much more marketable when we're going out to other cities trying to sell to meeting planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Ms. Bumpus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:43| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| I'm Kim Bumpus, president of Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| And in the spirit of time, I'm just going to hit the key highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| And please visit our website and go to the public notice section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| You will get summaries of all of our quarterly reports and current dashboards that tell you all the stats of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| But as you've already heard from Mary and earlier today, hotel-motel tax is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| We're trending 17 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Smith travel, year to date, we're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| We're right at about 6.8 percent in occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| We're growing our average daily rate by 2.1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| That is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| REVPAR, which is really how our hoteliers see if they're making money, that's revenue per available room, is up 9 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:26| That's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| And we really don't see any time that we're going to kind of take our foot off the pedal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| I mean, tourism is the number two industry in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| And Knoxville, Tennessee is really on fire right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| In partnership with this state, we fit every component to the Made in Tennessee campaign that's running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| We're musical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| We're beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| And we have a lot of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| And those are the three key components to that campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| And I know that we've sent you out the commercials, the soundtrack of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| We have a new digital campaign running right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| There's so many exciting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| This next fiscal year is about really expanding our communication opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| and really telling the community what the Convention and Visitors Bureau is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| how tourism impacts us as a community, and what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| And so it's an exciting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| We're working great with the Convention Center and their team, with Chilhowee Park and the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| All of the venues are doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| I also have with me Kurt Willis, who is the Visit Knoxville film director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| There are some exciting things happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| Again, you can get that in kind of the summary of our quarterly reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| And I'll kind of leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| I mean, there's so much stuff that I could really kind of keep talking for the next 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| which would make everybody crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| But one other announcement that will be coming is we will be having a press conference a week from tomorrow with Garth Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| So you'll be getting all that in your e-mails pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| So there's just a lot of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| So any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| Do you see any change of emphasis for what you're doing or just more of the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| In other words, is there some new initiative in the wings that you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| or are you just trying to market as best you can to all the folks that want to come to our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:12| Well, the list is long and mighty on new initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| Where we're really focusing where it comes into new is what's called tourism infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| Like right now we're rolling out a campaign with Visit Knoxville TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| where we will be the information channel in all of the hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| We'll be the default channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| So instead of someone turning on the current default channel, which is run by Town Magic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| and them getting bombarded with advertisements from Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, and Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:41| they will now be Visit Knoxville TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| We'll be telling them what they can do in Knoxville, where they should eat, where they should visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| and really kind of grabbing them with that first impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| So that's a new initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Sales, marketing, those are kind of staples to a CVB, and yes, we're doing those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| but we're doing it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| We definitely have a budget, which makes us have to think outside the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| and do things where we can maximize that return, and we're doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| and that comes through partnership with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| It also comes through new partnerships we'll be rolling out with all of our major tourism stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| on how they can invest with us to expand our reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| So there's a lot of different ways we're doing it, but, yeah, there's new and there's old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| Do you go back and assess or interview people that have come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| and find out what they liked or didn't like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| In other words, are you getting good feedback for the experience they're getting here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| Definitely, and we're actually working on a research project right now in partnership with our agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| which is Tomris, and we'll have those results in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| and from that we'll be creating a new positioning statement for Knoxville for tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| We'll be rolling that out at the first of the year, and that will coincide with the new website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| the new visitor's guide, a lot of different new things that will be hitting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| So question, how will you determine who goes on this reel that you're going to have in the hotel rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| or the continuous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| That is going to be, obviously we're doing that for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| One, to control that messaging, but two, it's a revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| It's a way for people to invest and visit Knoxville and grow the marketing fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| in partnership with what the city puts in and what the county puts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| So we'll be doing that, but there will be some infomercial-type stuff too for all of our attractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| and then when restaurants and different experiences like that want to invest in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| then there will be a small partnership fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| So let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| What is the impact or what is the benefit of all the outdoor sports that we have here to offer now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7540)|
| 2:05:49| whether it be the urban wilderness, IMs, Blue Ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| The outdoor experience for East Tennessee and primarily Knoxville is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| I mean, that really is going to end up being sort of a destination experience in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:04| It's not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Right now it's an excellent added value to everyone that we're bringing to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| So, for instance, when you're looking at group, you know, everyone, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| not everyone has as awesome of a convention center as we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| but everyone has a convention center and they have hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| And so once you get to that short list where your center is what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| and these hotels are what they want, well, their next decision factor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| what are the experiences I can have when I'm not within, you know, those walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| And that is where the outdoor component plays a huge competitive advantage for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| So you feel like that that is definitely the investment that we make is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:44| is definitely coming back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| Oh, I think definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| I mean, it's a game changer in partnership with the other experiences that we also have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7609)|
| 2:06:58| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Do you do anything to help market the botanical garden and arboretum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| I mean, there's folks that, you know, when you travel on vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| that's a great stop to do something with the family or if you're at a convention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| maybe the rest of the family goes over and spends a half a day there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| Are you doing stuff with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| I mean, we are a non-membership convention and visitors bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| so we market all of our assets for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| And then we also market those assets in different ways when they want that type of partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:28| So, you know, if they want a pamphlet or brochure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| or help with figuring out how to get people to their destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| that is what we do, and, yes, we do work with the botanical gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| But, I mean, you like go to the conventioneers and provide information to them too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| And we also have what's called the ride-along program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| where when visitors guides go out to that leisure market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| and remember, we're putting Knoxville on the map as a premier getaway destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| We're going after that leisure traveler from the two- to four-night stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| and we put those brochures into the visitor's guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| So when they open it up, a bunch of extra pamphlets then fall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| That kind of entices them on what they could do if they choose Knoxville as their destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| So the public assembly facilities fund is shown on page 27 at the top, fund 503,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7697)|
| 2:08:23| and there are two small capital initiatives on page 13 of the handout for capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7703)|
| 2:08:31| So 27 in the handout and page 13 of the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| Yes, my name is Greg McKay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| and it's an honor for me to serve as the director of public assembly facilities for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| I brought with me our general manager, Dale Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| The public assembly facilities is over the city-owned and operated entertainment venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| which is the Coliseum, the Auditorium, along with the parking garages there and the Plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| as well as Chilhowee Park with Jacob Building, the Barnes, and the Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| So out at the Coliseum, we're proud to say that we're the host for the championship ice bears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| They won the Southern Professional Hockey League championship this year, and we're proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| They did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| We've also been a busy year at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| We had 154 performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| We had a utilization factor of 41 percent, which could be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| But one thing I noticed while we were doing the study, when we had people come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7766)|
| 2:09:32| is we realized that people didn't really know how much stuff was going on at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| I didn't realize it myself until I got this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| So we have tried to ramp up our social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| We've increased our Instagram readership by some 400 percent, and we're on Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| We're on Twitter, trying to get out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| trying to find a free way to let people know what we're doing since we don't have an advertising budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| I know everybody's curious about the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| and I've been advised by Jim Hagerman to say that it will be ready in June, just not to say which year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| But we are anticipating that it should be here sometime next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| It's much more extensive and comprehensive than I realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| Even just last week, they were still requesting we find information about shows from 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:18| It's going to be very good when they're done with it, but it's been a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| Out at the Chill Highway Park, we've had some new shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| We've had the Neon Vibe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| We've had Robotics Revolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| We had 201 event days last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| We're also working more with the neighborhood and local groups to try to bring them into the park and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:43| We're also trying to make the park look better without spending a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| Anybody could make it look great with a million dollars, but we've found ways to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| We've had a couple of communities where the community comes out and helps us plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| Ken Oaks digs lilies to give us some day lilies, and we planted them along the bank of the new bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| We had the neighborhood get together and do all the planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| We got a project done for maybe $500 that would have cost us $12,000 to $15,000 if we had to hire someone to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7867)|
| 2:11:15| We are looking at making the place better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| In the last year, we've put our 50K solar array on the Jacob Building, which is now generating a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| There was no city investment in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| It was paid for by a third-party person, and we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| We opened up our new 13-stall public bathroom out at Chill Highway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| That and a combination of Kaboom, which I'd like to take credit for, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| It's a new playground that the MUSE got a grant for, and it was a community build also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:47| Now that center along the Beeman Street side has become a hub of activity between the bathrooms, the picnic shelters, the Kaboom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| and we're trying to make it look better with all the plantings that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| If you've got any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| Greg, on your capital budget, parking garage pole lights, I assume whatever you install will be operated then by the electricity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:12| generated by the panels over there at the parking garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| The pole lights are for the Coliseum parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| We do have solar panels over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| That's what I'm thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Indirectly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| I mean, those go into KUB, who pays us for them, and we in turn buy electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| Just out of curiosity, what percent of your overall utility use does that provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| Those solar panels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| They provide an income of about $350, average $350 a month, which is more than enough to power all the parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7957)|
| 2:12:49| Councilman Delvaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| Just curious, with regard to Chilhowee Park, are you finding any additional uses that you could make of the Jacobs Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| or the grounds that might bring in additional traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| I mean, you have some shows that come year after year, and you hope they continue, but is there any new thrust that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| Any new stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| As a matter of fact, I kind of glossed over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| I'm particularly excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| We actually have two shows planned this summer for the Homer Hamilton Amphitheater, which is seldom used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=7999)|
| 2:13:28| The fair uses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| We've had a couple of wrestling shows since I got there, but there's going to be two concerts there this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| so we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| I think it's an underused facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| We've also had some new shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| I'm looking through my notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| I've got them somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| I mentioned, oh, there's one called Questival, which is a social media scavenger hunt of sorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:50| It's going to take over the Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| And here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| The Color Run is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| The Knoxville Toy and Comic Expo is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| Knoxville Scale Modelers Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| And Waste Connections has their employee picnic over in Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| Next year we have some new shows planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| A Tinsel and Treasures is going to come to Chillhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| I think they were at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| St. Jude's is doing a 5K run, and Knox Heritage is going to be doing a summer supper over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:24| The second question was with regard to the area along Magnolia there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| There's a couple of old private buildings that somewhat detract from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| Is there any hope that Jim York will release enough money for you to buy those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| and incorporate that land into the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| Well, there's certainly hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| I mean, I see them every day and realize, you know, except for the pool place, they're in pretty bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| They're not inviting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| I mean, they're kind of off-putting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| They're not inviting at all, especially the one with the stencil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Keep Out, on the plywood that's nailed to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| I used to love the Guns, Guns, Guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| That always gave me a warm feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| I would hope that if there was money available in the future that we'd look in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| Sort of expand the fence out and control the corner, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| I was a little bit surprised that there wasn't anything in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| for a continuation of the study of the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| Did you all talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| The continuation of the study of the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| I mean, you've got a plan coming back, right, in June, as he says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| I mean, is there going to be any additional feasibility study on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| On the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| I think we need to get this back and really digest it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| I mean, they're going to be doing a complete feasibility analysis of all the other venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| this particular venue, and then also the structural analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| And like Greg just said, this report is fairly extensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| probably more so than what we had anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| Greg and I were able to see a very rough draft of two of the deliverables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| that did not have the third piece to it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| and it's pretty impressive the information they've accumulated and put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| So it's going to take a while for all of us to digest that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| and then, of course, we're going to have to make some decisions based on that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| You think that would be something that you would consider doing at Chilhowee Park as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| to analyze what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| I think eventually, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| The good news is there are some really good, positive things happening at Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| and Greg was able to highlight that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| Of course, if you guys haven't been to the Muse, you've got to get over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| It's amazing what they've done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| Kaboom, the new bathrooms and picnic shelters, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| Greg's been wonderful in trying to get some people out there to do some beautification efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| That's been very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| And then one of the things that's in here is, of course, the new sign for Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| So, yes, I do think that that will be the next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| but I think we've got to deal with this Coliseum Auditorium first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8204)|
| 2:16:52| Has there been any overtures to Mr. Haslam or Mr. Clayton, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8212)|
| 2:17:02| about the possibility of putting their name on a nice performing arts building at that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| No, but you're free to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| I'm happy to dedicate it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Thank you, Mr. Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| We have effectively alienated our police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| The only people with guns, we've made them wait 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| So come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| It's your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| Just don't say shoot when you get some real bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| Okay, the police department is pages 11 through 13 in the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| And also page 11 in your capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| It just so happens they ended on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| Chief, before you start, I mean, we've all heard of the unfortunate incident that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| but I would assume a good outcome from what I've read and heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| Yes, and I appreciate you asking, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| Officer Jimmy Wilson, I talked to him this morning, of course, was with him last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| He's doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| I talked with him this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| He's in great spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| He's a tough guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| I asked him how he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| He said it didn't hurt quite as bad as he thought it was going to, and said it felt like a carpet burn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| So I guess that's the result, and we're very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| We're very thankful, of course, for the opportunity to get the funding to buy all of our officers ballistic vests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8308)|
| 2:18:36| and they wear them, and thank goodness they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| So clearly we're at the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| We take care of the safety of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| and as we know with all the things going on throughout our country, this job gets tougher and tougher every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8328)|
| 2:18:57| But our officers continue to do an amazing job keeping a wonderful community engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8337)|
| 2:19:04| so that we don't see these issues that we've seen, these isolated incidents throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:10| And so we're very proud of the force we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8350)|
| 2:19:15| We currently have, we're authorized 416 officers, about 115 non-sworn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8355)|
| 2:19:23| and of those we currently have, I think we're at about 403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:31| So as of today in the officer ranks, about 108 or 109 of our civilian positions have been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| So we're doing pretty good there in terms of manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| We come with our regular request in terms of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| As you all know, we're the largest group in the city as far as personnel, and we are a service agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| and so the majority of our funding goes to salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| We realize we're the largest part of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| but we also realize we have a huge responsibility for the safety of the city, and we take that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:15| You've gotten before you our request, and we have a few capital projects that we've requested as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:23| Happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| Can you tell us a little bit about the Joint Training Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| We heard a little bit from Chief Stan Sharp doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| but you guys are working together apparently at the Cement Plant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| So it's actually one of the things that's happened with us is our academy has run for 20-plus years over at the Moses Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:46| That, of course, has been sold and repurposed, and so we had to look for a new home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| We're currently operating temporarily out of our facility on the rifle range out in the east area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8452)|
| 2:21:01| And so we started looking for an opportunity to build a new academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8461)|
| 2:21:08| There are several requirements that we have to have because of our accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| Our academy is accredited, and so we have certain requirements we need to have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| and one, of course, is an administration building with a classroom and library and all those amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| And so there was an opportunity to obtain some property we're still working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| but I think we're closer than we have been on obtaining that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| and then the next steps will be to put shovels in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| And when we talked about this, the fire was also looking for a stable facility for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:49| and we certainly had the conversation about doing this jointly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| and having one large facility for all public safety to be located at one spot for our training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8513)|
| 2:22:03| A separate question is there's all this talk at the national level about every cop having a personal camera on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8523)|
| 2:22:13| How do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| I mean, at some point you're an equipment acmule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| and I'm just curious how you balance all that with doing your job and getting things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| So body-worn cameras is a major discussion that's going on nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| Our position is we are not against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| The issue is in Tennessee we have some work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| and I'll be working with several other police chiefs in our state and sheriff's office with legislators at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8554)|
| 2:22:42| talking about those issues, and some have to do with personal privacy issues for people in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| And so we've got to work on how that video can be accessed and by whom, and so that's one piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8568)|
| 2:22:56| Once it's a record, who gets it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| Right. At this point, anyone can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| So that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| So if I come to your home and go into your home when you call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| and generally people don't call because they want me over for coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| And so when I come to your home, whatever it is that I'm dealing with there for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| your neighbor sees the car parked out front, then they come to the police department tomorrow and ask for a copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| and then they post it on the Internet for all to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| Well, it's good to case houses then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| It could be as well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| And so those are the issues that we've got to work out with the state before we dive into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:31| And so then the other issues, of course, will be budgetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| They're practically throwing cameras at us, but where the cost is is in the storage of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:41| And we certainly don't have enough servers to store that kind of data, and so we'd have to go to the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8621)|
| 2:23:47| And for an agency our size, you're looking at close to half a million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| Just to store the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| Yeah, it's a complex question, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Chief, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| I'll ask maybe the easy one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| The first item on the capital budget for a drone, I assume that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8645)|
| 2:24:12| It's an unmanned aerial vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| Yeah, drones have warheads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| This does not have a warhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| You don't have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Yeah, so an unmanned aerial vehicle, we have requested for our search and rescue team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| The state law very clearly says how and when that can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| And so that is one of the approved utilizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| We have a lot of dense areas around here where young people get lost as well as our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:42| And so we have to be able to get through that area quickly for the safety of an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| And so this will give us a new capability to be able to find people that are lost or missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| Also, certainly we can use it if we're searching for a fugitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| Well, secondly, it's more of a comment, and it's to applaud you, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| for your stance on releasing data relative to your officers and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| I know it's a touchy area, but I like the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| Yeah, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| As you all know, the Police Data Initiative is a national initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| and we are very engaged in that on a national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8718)|
| 2:25:25| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| I asked this earlier of a different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| Maybe it was Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8730)|
| 2:25:31| But there's a lot of overtime in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| and I realize there are occasions where officers are out there and they have to finish what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| One of the items is for $1.1 million, almost $1.2 million for the patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| and that's the biggest group of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| I'm curious, is that somewhat of a placeholder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| Is that your experience level today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| Is that the kind of stuff that the feds help fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| and so it's a good way to get personnel costs covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| I mean, I'm just trying to figure out how overtime fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| So we have a number of reasons we use overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| Everything from officers having to report to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8761)|
| 2:26:05| We have to pay them for their court time, their court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| So that's a big drain on the overtime budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| But then we also have a number of things that come up throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| For example, the extra personnel we put on the greenway after the most recent incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| the extra personnel we put up in the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| And so when we have these types of things, we have to cover them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| without pulling from our resources to keep the rest of the city under safe watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8792)|
| 2:26:40| So, yes, these are generally based on Jim does a great job of watching how we use that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8800)|
| 2:26:48| and helps us budget that appropriately each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| Speaking of the greenway, I saw Officer Carberry, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| Yes, Don Carberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| So is that the enforcement that you're using now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| Are there multiple officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| She is with our neighborhood bike officer patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| And so what we've done is now it's kind of a combination between the officers who work that shift regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| and some of them are working additional hours filling that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| So they're hitting it both during their regular duties as well as during overtime duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| And then I noticed as well that you have officers at Fort Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Yeah, hopefully we can discourage the jumping from the rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| Well, we had discussions with the mayor this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| You're probably aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| I think we've got a good situation coming up or a good answer to that solution, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| So any other equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| Yeah, I just wanted to compliment and thank the police department generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| You send officers to almost every kind of public neighborhood meeting, the business, professional associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8874)|
| 2:28:00| I think it's really great kind of team building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| Everyone feels like they're part of the same effort and the same team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| And I think it's healthy for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| I think it's healthy for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| And I appreciate your guys taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| Sometimes it's after hours and they've got to show up with a map and a discussion of what's on the raids online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:19| But it really is appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| It's part of our liaison officer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| And I think it also is a huge part of why the community has the trust that they have in our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8905)|
| 2:28:33| and why we can sit mostly confident that some of these issues we're seeing in other places will not necessarily happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:45| We don't want to be saying cheese it, it's the cops or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| You guys are part of a team that makes the city work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| So I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| Other agencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| So MPC's on page 16 at the bottom of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| And then I think Jim mentioned something earlier about part of the budget amendment that was coming to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8949)|
| 2:29:20| Again, we're going to have a couple of budget amendments on the first council meeting in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| And one of those I think will be part of that will be some additional funding for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8967)|
| 2:29:35| Will that be a budget amendment for this current year or be for the current year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8975)|
| 2:29:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis and members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| In the interest of time, and you're respecting your time in that and other folks behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| we just want to be very brief in my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| As you're very much aware, MPC has gone through a lot of change in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| The staff has done a very good job in moving forward with those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9002)|
| 2:30:08| But also I would really want to highlight that the Metropolitan Planning Commissioners themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9008)|
| 2:30:14| and the work that they do and the guidance that they provide to staff and the recommendations that they give to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9014)|
