| 0:00:00| We're going to start the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| They don't want you to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=4)|
| 0:00:06| It's private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=6)|
| 0:00:07| That's what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=7)|
| 0:00:08| They don't want you to give us a hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=8)|
| 0:00:11| A hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=11)|
| 0:00:17| Chairman, I have to leave about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=17)|
| 0:00:20| I don't see but two or three people, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=20)|
| 0:00:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| Okay, the first item is an ordinance amending the Knox County Charter to add Section 9.18 to Article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=23)|
| 0:00:29| providing for the maintenance and administration of an effective civil service merit system for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| or all Knox County employees in the classified service as determined by the Commission of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=34)|
| 0:00:39| Knox County Charter is adopted November 8, 1988, and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| Ordinance 101, second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| Go ahead, Frances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| I'm Frances Fogerson, Human Resources Director for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| I spoke yesterday, and so I'm going to make this a fairly abbreviated version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| The one thing that I want to point out that many persons don't understand about county government is that there is a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=59)|
| 0:01:09| personnel plan, county personnel policies, and that is directed to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=69)|
| 0:01:18| and put into place jointly by the county mayor and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| That was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| We have quite an extensive policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| One person pointed out this ordinance was approved in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| It contains the required four base personnel policy and goes well, well beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| including discipline, a grievance system, classification and compensation, benefits eligibility, quite a lot of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=99)|
| 0:01:49| Now, that being said, it is not in place universally in the county because of that state law that we've talked about before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=109)|
| 0:01:58| that permits each elected official, each county official, to have separate and distinct policies if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=118)|
| 0:02:06| And I've mentioned before they have all so chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| With that, let's just give a few comments about the proposal of having a civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| Civil service is a very good system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| It has many advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| It also has some disadvantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| I would like to talk just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| I gave some figures that you may have read in the paper that said under the most cost-effective approach we could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=149)|
| 0:02:38| that civil service, in my estimation, would cost an additional $750,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=158)|
| 0:02:47| I still believe that that is a fairly accurate figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| However, please keep in mind that because a portion of that money included start-up professional consultation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| that that would not be a recurring figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| There was some comparison that that figure, when added to the approximate $1 million that we have for the rest of the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:11| is excessive compared to the city's system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| I would like to point out to you, I believe it was mentioned yesterday, the city civil service system does not administer benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=196)|
| 0:03:25| So we are talking about four of our employees that deal with insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| And we could administer civil service for precisely the same amount of money that the city does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| if we could drop our four medical insurance plans, two dental, one vision, flexible spending account, and employee wellness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| Now, surely we do not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| So in order to keep the administration of the employee benefits, and let me point out that is a county-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| that is the one place where we are unified in our personnel system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| is that all county offices use the same system of insurance and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| If we maintain administration of that within our current human resources department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| then we still would have to add five staff to do civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| There was some discussion about having access to a grievance and disciplinary system for other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=258)|
| 0:04:28| Right now, those elements are not required in those separate and distinct policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| Again, let me tell you, ours hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| We have the disciplinary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| We have the grievance and appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| We have performance evaluations, the class and compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| It's all in our plan and doesn't cost anything extra to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| So in essence, to have a civil service plan to add that extra element of the merit-based hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| that goes beyond the qualification certification that we do right now would involve adding additional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| and that would require additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| I just wanted to ask very quickly, Frances, I know that you had talked about the startup costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Is there a way that you could break that down and just put it in our packet or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| as to where you have estimated your staff costs, your space costs, your telecommunications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| Because you had broken those out yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Yes, I did, and basically I'm using what our current HR budget is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| Okay, but can you delineate that for us and put it in a paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| And then also, who would you ask or who would you do you know the names of anybody that you would contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=352)|
| 0:06:02| to give you the information to help you with those consultations in the startup process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| and those sorts of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Do you know of anybody right off the top of your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| I believe we would have to put that out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| We would have to develop an RFP and put it out to bid, and so no, right now I would not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| So you have no idea of who, what sort of, if there's a major company in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| There certainly are major companies that do human resources consulting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| and I could give you an example of a particular job they may have done for a local organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| I mean, just the names of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Do you know any of their names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| For compensation, we have used PTG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Mercer is another company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| That's what the city used for that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| And off my head, I can't give you others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| I do know that we have had RFPs for certain professional consulting services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| and several companies have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| So our purchasing department would have a list of companies that have bid previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Okay, that can answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| I was trying to think if there's anything else I wanted to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Go ahead, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| So I'm kind of a bottom line kind of a guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| In terms of we have an employee today, and then we have an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| same employee if this civil service measure is passed, and they're a problem employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| and we need to get from point A to point B, point B being they're no longer employed by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=461)|
| 0:07:50| I mean, there's four causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| We have issues with John Doe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| How do those two things compare in terms of time and in terms of cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| Do you understand my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Not precisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| How would we, if someone comes to you and parks and rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| and we have this employee engineering, this employee that's not performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| and they make a request to terminate this employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| We usually have a consultation with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| discuss whether or not we have gone through the progressive discipline process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| whether that's appropriate, you know, how long the employee has been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| what the particular offense is, whether we've had any performance contracts in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| Commissioner, it really varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| However, bottom line is, you know, we are an at-will employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| I don't want you to interpret that as saying we make terminations with no reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| although I think legally we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| We definitely compare an employee's performance or their conduct against our stated policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| And I guess that's probably my at-will is at one end of the spectrum, but, you know, having...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| I really think there's quite a bit of misperception about at-will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| You do retain your at-will privilege, but, you know, for many very good solid reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| we don't have no reason when we fire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| So then another side to that question is if this system as you have given us is implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| how would that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| We have employee in X department that needs...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| Having not experienced the civil service system, it's a little...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| I'm a little bit at a disadvantage other than in legal standings, their terminations are for cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| and in research papers I've read, terminations may be more difficult, but I can't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| I'm not sure I can precisely describe how they differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Commissioner Francis, I might be able to just throw in a thought or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| One way it could work if the amendment passes for the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| and then if the commission passes an ordinance to implement that amendment is then across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=623)|
| 0:10:33| in any fee office an employee who perceives herself or himself as aggrieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| would come before the merit, the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| They would ask for a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| The board would hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Evidence would be presented on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| The merit board would make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| and then usually the ordinance would grant either aggrieved party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| either the employee or the employer, the right to file an appeal with the chancery court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| and then it goes before the chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| In that situation, it could go before the chancery court de novo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| which means the chancery court hears it all over again from A to Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| or it could go before the chancery court only for judicial review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| which means the chancery court just reviews the record below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| and if the record below substantiates pretty much any good material substantial reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| for the board doing what the board did, then the board would be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| What are the practical implications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| A long time, I guess, would be a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| and of course if the termination were found to be incorrect under the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| then you'd be looking at back wages, you'd be looking at reinstatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| and those kinds of monetary...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| because what you're doing in a civil service system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| you are creating a property right in the employment for the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| and under an employment at will situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| there is no property right in the employment for the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| and under Tennessee law, that's what employment at will means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| There's no property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| And Francis is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I mean, we're not talking about being willy-nilly unjust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| but a civil service system does create a procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| and a process that lasts longer and could conceivably cost the county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:52| Isn't it also true that a civil service system is for the exceptional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| not the routine, for that moment for that employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| who may have a legitimate claim of being arbitrarily or capriciously excluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| And if you design it that way in the ordinance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Thank you, Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| My name is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| I work in Knox County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| Commissioners, I know I'm going to have to put you through this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| but I wrote a letter in response to Commissioner Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| when she sent out the ordinance and asked for comments from employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| and I would like to read that into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| and then I just have a couple of comments to make about this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| This is to Commissioner Elaine Davis, dated June 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| I received a copy of your memorandum and the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I want to thank you for the opportunity to comment on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| and thank you for the consideration you are giving to Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| I've read the ordinance and wanted to get my initial comments to you in a timely fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| so you have time to consider their worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| May I say at the outset that I'm neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| regarding the subject of a civil service system for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| I see advantages and disadvantages on both sides of the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| My biggest concern is that any system that gets implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| is done with careful consideration, the appropriate level of planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| and the involvement of all those who will be most greatly impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| It has been my observation that many resolutions and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| are passed without those elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| and as a result provide more confusion than solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| As to this particular ordinance, I have the following concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Number one, based on definition of the major players in the proposed system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| they are political appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| The secretary, i.e., the director of human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| is appointed by and reports to the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| is unclassified, and could be replaced at the discretion of any mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| The members of the merit board would be political appointees also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| Why the sheriff would have a vote on who gets elected to the board is a conundrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| since the ordinance specifies that sheriff's department personnel would be unclassified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| Affording votes to the fee officers when the question of the commission's authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| to impose a civil service system in those offices has not been resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| is also a mystery to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Item two, there are no minimum qualifications specified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| for either the secretary or the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| The powers and duties of these positions are vast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| and if properly executed will require a great deal of time and expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| While there is oversight by the commission in terms of approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| a mechanism for internal review and approval is lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| The commission should not be the only review or checkpoint between creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| and implementation of policies and procedures governing working conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| as well as classification plans and compensation schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| Item three, the ordinance as written is specific in some areas and general in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| For example, section 1-16 is a list of actions with no specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| as to whether they must be taken in sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Section 1-19, however, is very specific and detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| These two items are equally important, disciplinary action and layoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| and should be equally defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| The level of detail required in the ordinance to make it both effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| and consistent should be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| Item four, finally, and I consider this very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| much would be required to implement this ordinance in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| The timing of this implementation, including the sequence of events that should take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| and the method for communicating to and involving the employees, is not provided for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| It is always difficult for me to offer criticism without suggesting possible alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| I consider it unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| However, this subject is not one that lends itself to brief suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| I realize that the conversation has to begin somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| and that you are limited to the amount of time you will be personally able to keep this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| So may I simply suggest that the ordinance be drafted such that it specifies intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| a direction, and a timetable without the specifics of how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| The how really needs to be worked out by those involved in the day-to-day operation of each office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| managers and employees together without the political appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| and approved by the commission when completed as amendments to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| Again, Commissioner Davis, I want to thank you for taking this step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| and for giving employees the opportunity to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| I hope this helps some and I would be happy to discuss this subject further with you at your convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| That was my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| And here are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| I was not aware that this was going to be proposed as a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| Ms. Stackhouse, I wonder if you could tell me, when you do a charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| are you not required to attach some level of what it would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| I don't think you have to have a fiscal note to a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| And one of the reasons that we went back and determined for ourselves in the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| that a charter amendment would be more appropriate is when you look at the enabling legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| that allows a county to charter, it talks about charter contents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| Can I interrupt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| I'm sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| I think there's a level of disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| I think you're asking about a cost thing, and that's true when it goes on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| but not true if it's passed directly by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| That's the short answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| That's the difference because then you're not proposing that this become a ballot item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| Well, yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Well, if you amend the charter, I thought it had to go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| It will be a ballot item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| And so if it becomes a ballot item, there has to be a dollar value associated with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Well, you may be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| And it has to be a fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| I thought there had to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| And that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| No, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| But we went from ordinance concept to amendment concept because the charter enabling legislation says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1215)|
| 0:20:25| that the charter contents may provide for a civil service merit system and a pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| and it's in the same paragraph of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Our charter already provides for the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| So we felt that to be most correct, if you can ever be most correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| that it would be better for it to be a charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| and then that, we felt, would provide a safer floor for trying to make the civil service system countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1250)|
| 0:21:00| because there remains this sort of gloopy legal issue about can it apply to all the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| Maybe yes because they're part of the charter now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Maybe no because we're trumping some state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| And all those issues are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| But at least if it's a charter amendment as opposed to a mere ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| then I think the commission would be on more solid ground when the commission comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| than to draft the ordinance that will flow from the charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| because the charter amendment right now is pretty general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| I mean it's just a couple pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| And then the commission would draft some ordinance that would have all the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| But, you know, Barbara, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| It's supposed to have a fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Well, see, these are the concerns that I have about the discussions that have taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| regarding the estimates of what it would cost to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| because I've had a little bit of experience when it comes to folks trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| that it will cost X amount of dollars to do something in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| Every time we try to do something in Knox County, regardless of what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| we need more people and more people are more costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| And we always need more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| And I just had this occur when I went before the pension board regarding the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| that they were not putting our money in our accounts in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| And so as a participant on a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| I kept suggesting that they just needed to change some people's job responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| And the fact of the matter is they wanted more people and they wanted more space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| and they needed to go out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Well, when it all boiled down to it, they were very successful in making the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| that they needed to do without any additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| Somehow magic happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| And I submit to you that to suggest that just because there are X number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| in a department that do this job in the city, then I need X number more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| I think that bears some looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| And just as I challenged the pension board, I challenged this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| and every commissioner to look at estimates in depth before you suggest or accept them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1400)|
| 0:23:32| And I don't know how the law department would come up with a fiscal number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| I can just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| I don't think we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| I don't think our department could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Who are the responsible people for deciding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Especially when you get part of the argument about this is that so many of these things are already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1428)|
| 0:23:57| Well, if they're already in place, why would it cost so much to make a shift from here to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| I don't know where you plug in magical numbers about how many employee complaints are going to be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| Where do you get those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| That's really hallucinogenic imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| It certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| And part of the thing is that in the discussion of what it might take if somebody were terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| and the legal implications, well, you have to look at the other side, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| How many dollars have been lost due to successful wrongful termination suits that have been against the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| under the present system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| So, you know, there's a little bit of swarming that has to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| And I just would like to make sure that the right people are involved in the crystal ball, with the crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| So I don't know where this will all go, but I think a deep breath is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1491)|
| 0:25:00| Can I ask one question of you, Barbara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Where would you suggest that we get some of these numbers other than look at past litigation costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| and what else did you recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| Well, because I'm a member of the International City County Management Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| I get a lot of information regarding what's going on in other cities and counties in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| in the United States and internationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| So it's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| You know, people who do analysis have a step-by-step thing that they go through that builds to a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| and there are going to be some assumptions that are going to have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| But it's not something that you just come up with a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| You have literally first to define all of the elements that are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| and sometimes that takes looking at various approaches to how you want to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1556)|
| 0:26:06| your particular civil service thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| It's not an easy thing that you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| You know, people make a lot of money doing this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| And so I'm just suggesting that there are folks who understand how you do cost-benefit analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1577)|
| 0:26:27| but first you have to consider what do you really want this thing to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| What is it that you legitimately can get away with or can put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| To me, it hasn't been decided yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| And I just think that before you draft an ordinance or you put something on the ballot, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1604)|
| 0:26:52| suppose people in their infinite wisdom decided that they think this would be a good thing for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| Now you have to draft the ordinance and the specifics of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| and that's where you run into problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| My goodness gracious, you've got to know how much the city has gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| in terms of what they started with to where they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| I went over and talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| They have a 300-page volume of how that program operates on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| But that didn't just come about by magic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| That involved an awful lot of step-by-step hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Now my recommendation would be to take advantage of what they've been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| and learn from, start little and build and build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Barbara, I would like to say, too, it's going to be very difficult for us to compare the past to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| since we have not had an across-the-board civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| It's sort of like comparing apples to oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Because we've been a termination-at-will employer, even though we have a handbook, we make it very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| There are only very narrow, limited circumstances where an employee can grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1686)|
| 0:28:16| Obviously, they can grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Through the county, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| They can grieve if they are an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Grieve through the courts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Of the mayor's office and go through the personnel board, but then the mayor is the final arbiter on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| They can grieve through the courts, but only under certain limited circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Their cause of action has to arise under Title VII or the Family Medical Leave Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| or the Americans with Disabilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| And those are narrow circumstances for grieving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| Or if they actually believe they have a constitutional claim under the First Amendment or equal protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| But those are still narrow circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| So to try to compare the cost associated with defending or settling employment issues up to now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| with what they may look like in the future if you have an across-the-board merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| civil service system where you've created a property right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| I think it could be more difficult to look backward in order to project forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| It might be instructive to look at what it has cost the city or similarly situated cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| or counties in other parts of the country where they have created a property right in a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| I'm not disagreeing with you at all, Marianne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| This is not a science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| It's an art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| And you have to identify what your assumptions are along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| But because you make such good points, I think one of the things that is important is that the right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1790)|
| 0:29:59| who think logically and who can kind of put it together need to get together to do this kind of evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1799)|
| 0:30:11| Can I ask you one question, Marianne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| I know that in drafting this you used Shelby County as an example because they have a civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| And you've raised the question several times that you're not sure if fee offices could be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| Now, are the fee offices covered in Shelby County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| I think some of them are, but Shelby County started out with a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| And because they had a private act that created a civil service system for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| then their ordinance was grounded on the private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| Here we're doing somewhat of a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| We are relying on the philosophy espoused by the Tennessee Supreme Court in Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| to say that a charter county can do lots of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| We're relying on the charter-enabling legislation that says we can provide for a civil service system in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| And we're going in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| So the charter amendment that we've drafted is much more general than that ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| the draft ordinance attached to it, which is just a mere example of where the commission could go were the amendment to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1883)|
| 0:31:32| So it's, you know, Shelby County was a place to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| and there may be many things in that draft ordinance that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| and this county would want to do substantially differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| No, I agree. There are plenty of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| But we don't, you know, we're a little different animal because we're not talking about resting this on a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| And, for instance, what Commissioner Harmon just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| you could draft an ordinance that says that you may only appeal if you can make out a claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| that your termination was arbitrary and capricious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| or the chancery court may only review it for arbitrariness and capriciousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| All that can be worked into that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| It's not in there right now because we were just trying to offer the commission something to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| But the charter amendment, as it's written, is pretty general, and it doesn't have all those specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| You know, the commission can make it more specific or narrow that amendment if the commission wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| There really hasn't been any conversation at the commission level to talk about narrowing the amendment even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| But the commission certainly has the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| And, Barbara, that was some of the things that we were going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| I know that we kind of wanted to wait and see what public hearings brought about, what issues and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| There are a lot of things in here that I had wanted to make recommendations to or change or discuss on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| and John felt like that we needed to go ahead and just pass it and then bring about the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| And so I appreciate your comments, and I appreciate your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Francis has been more than helpful in bringing certain points and issues to light that we need to make sure that are part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| So I appreciate both of you all taking the time and effort to come and discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Seeing none, we have two more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Does anyone want to speak on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080722publichearing?start=2019)|
