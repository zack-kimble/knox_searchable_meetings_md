| 2:06:17| I've done a little research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| The mayor's salary is throughout the big four cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| Again, Knoxville is currently at $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| Chattanooga is $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| Nashville is $136,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| And I found that out recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| It was at $90,000, so there's been a substantial change there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| And if you go to Memphis, it's $162,000 for Mayor Wharton there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7601)|
| 2:06:48| I want to talk a little bit just briefly about precedent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Even though $12,500 is substantial, it's a lot of money to a lot of people, and I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| But I want to also point out the fact that in 1997, the council voted for a raise of $25,000 for the mayor seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7618)|
| 2:07:10| And in 2001, there was a $20,000 adjustment made to the mayor's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7630)|
| 2:07:18| So though $12,500 is nothing to scoff at, but, again, there's been much more substantial raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7638)|
| 2:07:27| And this is certainly well under the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7647)|
| 2:07:36| And so the pension issue, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| Another interesting fact here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| When we voted in, you know, term limits back in whenever it was, 1997 or whenever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| you know, a city elected official can serve for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| The way the pension is set up now, as we all are fully aware, you won't vest, a new person won't vest for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7674)|
| 2:08:03| So even though the current mayor is an exception to that, but moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| you will not be able to enjoy the benefits of a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| So I think that that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| Because due to the fact that if you're really a qualified candidate for the office of the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| I mean, more than likely that person is going to have a fairly decent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| They're going to be, you know, with benefits and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| So, you know, what we're asking for someone to do is to step out of the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| with more than likely would have the benefits that I described before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7715)|
| 2:08:41| So I think that the salary, if it was to be increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| and something that I would recommend that we look at every two years instead of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| waiting these long periods of time that we don't have these large jumps as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| So, you know, I just really think that if you don't have the ability to have an enticing salary and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7738)|
| 2:09:08| it's going to become a seat that really only the wealthy, the wealthiest people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| would have the ability to run for this seat and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| and not have to worry about the benefits of the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| So I don't want it to become an exclusive club, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| I think that that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| And so, I mean, I'll summarize a little bit and then open it up for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| There might be a little bit of debate about this, I'm going to assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| But history has shown us that by far this is not even, it's not the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| and it's really, in my mind, not even the largest salary increase for the mayor's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7779)|
| 2:09:46| With the pension, I think it's reasonable to have a salary that is not only aligned with the other major cities in our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| but provides enough incentive to leave private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| As I stated before, it's been nine years and I doubt many in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| and I know I can speak to that, though through tough economic times recently, since 05 particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| but I think most in the private sector have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| received some type of incremental pay increase, you know, since nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7810)|
| 2:10:17| Another important factor, I think Councilman Wallace brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| was that about the timing of the salary increase of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| Now, this is unique, again, because it's charter, it's by the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| so this would not take effect if we, if the council was to approve this, would not take effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| There's been, I saw two ordinances, it's either the last Saturday of, or the third Saturday in December or January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7839)|
| 2:10:47| I'm not exactly sure which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| But either case, we would budget for it, it would be, you know, everybody would know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7849)|
| 2:10:55| And so, next to last, you know, if we don't do it now, again, we'd have to wait two more years and the gap widens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7855)|
| 2:11:04| But I really want to emphasize that this, you know, the city mayor had no idea that I was going to bring this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7864)|
| 2:11:12| and people said, why are you bringing it forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| And the reason I brought it forward now is because we've been dealing with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| and it just was in my mind that, you know, this would be the appropriate time, we budget for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| you know, we've dealt with salaries and we've, it just seemed like an appropriate time to go ahead and hit it head on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| So those are the reasons that I brought this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| I appreciate the co-sponsors that I enjoyed, that joined me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7892)|
| 2:11:37| And so I'll just open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7897)|
| 2:11:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor Cowley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| Well, I mean, the amount of money is something we shouldn't spend all night debating here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| It's a relatively modest amount of money compared to the kind of things we've had on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| But I do wonder about the timing, and I say this with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| I wonder whether you don't have somewhat of a conflict of interest since the newspaper said you were going to run for mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| and it was going to be a cap in your career, and are you raising the wages for yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| And I don't mean that in any demeaning sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| If the major cities are paying more, that's certainly something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| But I wonder if there isn't some kind of a conflict of interest, if you will directly benefit from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| That said, the amount of money is a relatively modest increase in the scheme of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7946)|
| 2:12:33| so I'm not going to spend all night talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| But those are the points I think are worthy of bringing up, if not for ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| and for the public to question what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| The mayor has been quoted as saying she did not ask for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| and I don't know whether that's because it's not good politically to do when you're about to enter a race or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7966)|
| 2:12:53| and I respect that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| But I guess it's the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| If I understand correctly what you're saying, to get this on a ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| it would have to be an ordinance by the beginning of August, I guess, or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| It's not on a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| It's a vote of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| There is no charter change or anything required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| It's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| And so timing-wise, why now as opposed to after the budget or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7995)|
| 2:13:21| What advantage do we gain by doing this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| Well, like I stated before, you can start picking up the qualifying papers in March to run for the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8004)|
| 2:13:32| So rather than do it after that time, and if the city mayor was the only candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| then it really does look like a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| So my opinion is if someone is teetering, if they're thinking about really running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8021)|
| 2:13:47| it may entice them, it may not entice them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| I'm just, in my mind, politically, this is how I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| I think it's better to do it earlier than it is later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| And that way it's out and everybody knows what's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8038)|
| 2:14:03| And so, I mean, I can't describe it any better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| I mean, as far as – I mean, I'm going to go ahead and then – are you – are you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| Yeah, I was just – those are the questions that occurred to me as this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| Like I said, certainly the amount isn't something that is a mountain to climb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| So I'm concerned about the timing and whether there's some potential conflict there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| Yeah, well, I mean, since you pointed me out directly, I mean, I've been doing this –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8065)|
| 2:14:34| I've been on council since 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| I've served – I've been elected four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| I think I've served, you know, pretty decently in them, being elected four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| I respect your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| You know, that would be five years down the road, and that's an eternity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| And that's two years after my current term and last term as a council person is over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| And two years removed, I can tell you, is a very, very long time in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8099)|
| 2:15:07| People forget about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| You know, I kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| Change your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| Well, and I kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| I say I'm starting to look like Jack Sharp without hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| I've been around for a long time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| And people, even though if you serve well or don't serve well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| I understand the reality of people that they get tired of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| and they look for fresh, younger faces or different ideas and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8127)|
| 2:15:33| But, I mean, it doesn't have – you know, I'm gainfully employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| I mean, I have means to support myself, and I'm certainly not doing it to better my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8139)|
| 2:15:50| Again, it's time that we address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| You know, it's been nine years for all the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| So, anyway, I'm not going to talk any more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| I think, simply, this is a fair compensation for the mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8163)|
| 2:16:09| And given that it will not take effect until the next mayor is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| and that next mayor may be the current mayor, but it will be the next mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| So I'm very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| And if nobody else is going to speak, I will move that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| I have no problem with this either, but I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| Have you considered a pay raise for city council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| And also, or the reimbursements the way the county does and the school board does for city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8197)|
| 2:16:45| When was the last time city council had a pay raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| And it won't affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| The last pay raise went into effect right before I was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| I was the first elected to council, so 12 and a half, 13 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| I mean, it seems like we've done police and fire and general service, and now we're doing the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| and we've done everybody but the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| And so I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| I'm not saying that that happens, but I'm saying has this been looked into not only in terms of salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8232)|
| 2:17:17| but also I know when I ran, I didn't even know there was a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| But I do know there are expenses that accumulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| And that's true, and directed at me, no, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8245)|
| 2:17:31| I mean, any council member can rightfully bring that, just as I can as vice mayor or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8251)|
| 2:17:38| We all carry the same weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| So if someone wanted to bring that forward, then, you know, they can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| But I have not researched any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| But, again, if someone wanted to research, I've got some lights over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| I bet there's going to be some discussion about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| And I'll go to Councilman Brown, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| Well, I'm thinking about, first of all, the next election has to be done after a council election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| If we didn't do it this time, it would be 2017 to go into effect in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| And I'm thinking about the recent property tax increase that people voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8296)|
| 2:18:23| And I don't know if it's such a good thing in the eye of the public to raise the salary of the mayor at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8303)|
| 2:18:31| even though it's a small increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| I don't know if that's such a good thing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| I think we all need to remember that this is the office of the mayor regardless of the person who is sitting in that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8323)|
| 2:18:50| And so regardless of whether I like this mayor, don't like this mayor, the next one or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| I hear the names of several council members bantered around as potential mayoral candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| But we're looking at the seat, not an individual, not a possibility down the road in two years, five years, 20 years, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8342)|
| 2:19:11| I can assure you I won't be running for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| And I won't have another term on council, so life is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| Everybody can relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| But I just fully think that this is the office of the mayor we're looking at, and I think that this is the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8361)|
| 2:19:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| No further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| Hearing none, 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8385)|
| 2:19:52| We have one person that signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| Joyce McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| It's been a while since you've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8402)|
| 2:20:16| I hear by objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8416)|
| 2:20:28| I'm Boris McCall, 4710 Washington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| I've been a resident of the city of Knoxville for just about as long as it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8432)|
| 2:20:40| For the last 83 years I've lived in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| I have been a member of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| I have retired from the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8450)|
| 2:20:53| I enjoyed my stay with the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8453)|
| 2:21:00| And I'm quite well versed in the city's attitude towards certain police officers and certain issues that goes on in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8460)|
| 2:21:19| I recently got a copy of this proposed ordinance, which is, in just a moment I'll call the number to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8479)|
| 2:21:33| which is Ordinance Number 0-177-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8493)|
| 2:21:43| And I'm here to tell you that I am opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8503)|
| 2:21:50| It's detrimental to my welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| Would you mind, what's the caption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| What's it about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| In regards to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| To the changing of the retirement ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8523)|
| 2:22:11| It's a silly ordinance, and I'm going to give you the legislation if you just give me time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8537)|
| 2:22:18| The Tennessee Constitution under Article 11, Section Number 2, is what I'm here to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8538)|
| 2:22:40| If that ordinance, which they're citing under Section 9 of the Constitution, is to the matter that I am objecting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8560)|
| 2:22:59| and if this ordinance passes, a lot of those of us who are aging are going to suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8579)|
| 2:23:11| And I think that this ordinance is put here to preempt some court action that's coming down the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8591)|
| 2:23:25| here in not too long of a period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| And I want to make this brochure that I have here that contains both the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8610)|
| 2:23:45| and the violation of the state's Constitution under Section 2 as well as Section 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8625)|
| 2:24:00| which the city has proposed to operate from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| And I would like to place into the record for purposes of, we have to go to the Chancellor's Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8646)|
| 2:24:19| to argue why it's going to be detrimental to my welfare, my family's welfare, and probably a lot of other retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8659)|
| 2:24:33| because we feel, I feel, I can't speak for nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| Well, I'm about to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| I feel that it's a silly ordinance, very silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8682)|
| 2:24:51| And if I can give this to someone to mark as an exhibit, A, B, and C, I would like now to give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8691)|
| 2:25:10| And I hope I made the five-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| If I could just try again, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| Can I ask you what's the subject matter of the silly ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| Because I don't, you said a number, but I don't know what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| Well, I'll tell you what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| It's about the ordinance that's drafted, and you'd think some middle midget put it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8727)|
| 2:25:35| What's the subject matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| I just told you they were trying to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| For instance, they're trying to say that some of us who are retired, been retired as persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8741)|
| 2:25:51| and you're trying to change it and cite it as human beings on a pension program in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8751)|
| 2:26:05| don't have trains or utilities employed in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8765)|
| 2:26:14| And they're changing, calling me a non-person and trying to put in a simplistic name and say that we are human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8774)|
| 2:26:28| Well, I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| My mother told me that 83 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| And I resent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| And every policeman in the city of Knoxville who are my age or running closely should also have a complaint because it's denigrating us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8796)|
| 2:26:55| Thank you so much for coming this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| It's well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| For consistency's sake, it's five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| You've been here several times, and you're welcome to come back to every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| Well, I'm not coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=8830)|
