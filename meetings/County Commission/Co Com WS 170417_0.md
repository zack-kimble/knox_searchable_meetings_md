| 0:00:49| Chris who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| And his pink tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| Chairman Smith, you had asked me today about revenue breakout by general fund and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=56)|
| 0:01:05| it comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| I'm going to give you like the top four or five and that's going to kind of compose everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=66)|
| 0:01:22| and basically this is based off 2017 numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| The current property taxes for the general fund account for 67.5% of the revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=85)|
| 0:01:34| The local option taxes account for 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| Permits, fees, and fines account for about 10.26%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| State of Tennessee accounts for about 5.7%, and fee from officials, which are excess fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=108)|
| 0:01:57| account for about 4.65%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| That will get you close to like 97%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| The rest is either federal or other governments or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| Could you repeat the first number, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| 67.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Number three, just go down the numbers again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Current county property taxes account for 67.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| Permits, fees, and fines account for about 10.26%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| County local option taxes account for 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| State of Tennessee accounts for 5.77%, and fee from officials accounts for 4.65%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=158)|
| 0:02:48| And that 5.7% from the state of Tennessee, is that basically sales tax also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| No, no, that would be haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| That's haul tax, and any fees that we receive from the state, we get some bank fees and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| And so all sales tax would be in what we call the county local option tax line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| And the general fund don't get a lot of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| We budget 4.8, and we give $2 million to Solid Waste, 2.4 to Solid Waste, thanks to the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=193)|
| 0:03:21| And so that's that total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| And the majority of the sales tax goes to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| And so that's just something that you ask about, and I just wanted to give you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=207)|
| 0:03:35| We were able today, just for a warning, you didn't receive a packet from me, and you may have received one from Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| but we've been pretty much eyeballs deep in budget, so if you want any more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| I would tell you the state's still not sent sales tax, and so we're waiting on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| And Gary's waited with bated breath back there for sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| He's nervously waiting like I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| But they're late, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| But we did get a chance to look at property tax today that came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| and so we get to look at property tax through the month of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| And for the general fund, we have collected through March about $105.5 million compared to about $103.8 a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=251)|
| 0:04:23| So that's about a 1.7% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| That increase will hold true on all three funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| General Purpose School Fund received about $95.7 million compared to $94.1 a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| Debt Service Fund has received $51.1 compared to $50.2 from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=277)|
| 0:04:47| That's about a 1.7% increase over the same time of year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| We normally see about 1.5% growth year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| You've heard me say that for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| At the end of January, we were actually up about 5.4%, and I think that was really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=299)|
| 0:05:08| And so it has definitely, people have paid early, whether it was mortgage companies or whatever, paid early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| And that has settled back down to what would be considered normal for good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| We recently, this past week, got our, we're going to go to market, I think, this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| and issue our $99 million worth of bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| And we had our phone calls with our two rating agencies, which is Moody's and Standard & Poor's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=331)|
| 0:05:41| and both reaffirmed our bond rating, AA1 and AA+, both with stable outlooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| And so that is positive, and that's what we expected to happen, and that is what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| And so if you have an interest in looking at those reports, we can send those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| If you want to go to sleep at night, you can read them, and they're very entertaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| They say the same thing that we have saw over the past few years, and it's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| And so those bonds will be issued this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| We'll see what type of interest rate that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| It's always interesting, and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| I'm pretty sure it's this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| We haven't got sales tax yet for this year, for this month, and so we'll wait on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=382)|
| 0:06:33| Will tax is up about $400,000 over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| That's actually through February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Hotel and motel tax is still up about $870,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Once again, that's also through January, so we haven't received the new months in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| And so I'm waiting on those reports to come in, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| That's about all that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| I mean, we're basically looking and analyzing our numbers to formulate a budget for FY18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=419)|
| 0:07:11| That will be coming, delivered by the mayor on May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| And we have worked really closely with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| and Gary's probably sick of me calling him, and I know I'm sick of him calling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| And so I think we're in a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| And so the only other thing is because there's nothing else that's really out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=451)|
| 0:07:46| so I'll stop there and answer any type of questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Commissioner Spoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| Wheel tax, you said, were up $400,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| Wheel tax, let's see here, through the month of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| we had received a little over $8.7 million compared to the previous year of about $8.35, so right at $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=484)|
| 0:08:16| So in eight months, they've registered over 11,000 more vehicles in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=496)|
| 0:08:27| Is that set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| Is that above?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I know it's above collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Is that above budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Well, it's above actual over actual, and so it would be above budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=516)|
| 0:08:45| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| 11,000 cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| And so I would remind you that the majority of wheel tax goes to our public libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| With the next biggest piece going to the general purpose school fund and a small piece going to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Very, very small piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Mr. Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| In the 2018 budget, we keep looking at revenues that come in from the haul tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| Are we making any kind of plans when they phase that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| I thought this year I would just increase haul income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I'd double it and just see what the state did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I'm kidding, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Yeah, what you will see is us to continue to reduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| We have reduced that in the FY18 budget by approximately 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| So that will be phased out, and we will begin to phase that out as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| And it's, you know, that's an impact on the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| I think gas tax goes to the House floor maybe on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| And so I know we'll continue to watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| If the state does pass a gas tax, right, that's more money in gasoline tax for infrastructure and for roads and paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=605)|
| 0:10:15| Keep in mind, though, that what that does is, as it is proposed, it accelerates the haul income tax repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| And so I've told Dwight I have to take some of his money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| Do you in the budget, did you leave any leeway for if that does happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Because it will cut it by 25 percent of what the 25 was already getting cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| We have proposed the budget as is normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| So we did not take into account the gas tax passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| So we basically just said, okay, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| If the state does pass the gas tax or whatever the improve act, whatever it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| then we'll go back and adjust what we need to adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| I firmly believe that we have revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| We would have enough growth in revenue in the general fund to offset haul tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| Keep in mind that we actually had a good quarter to end for 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| And so once we get haul income tax, we budget for 17 current year, 2.1 million last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=670)|
| 0:11:19| We got in like three, if you take out the correction from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| I think we'll get another good year this year of haul income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| But you will see us phase that 2.1 out over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| If we have to expedite it, then we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| We purposely did not anticipate the state doing anything on gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=697)|
| 0:11:46| Hey, Chris, currently right now the state reappraisals are going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| We will lock in our property tax rate the day that we lock in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| At that point, the full appeal process will not be through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| How much do we leave on the table from reductions from that aggregate base that we're basing that rate off of that get further reduced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| I would tell you that the reappraisals that are going out are all at Shouse's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| I have mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| No, just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| I'm going to give Shouse a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| We base the budget off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| We say, what do we anticipate annual growth being on property tax, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| And so we base it off as if there is no reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| And then we know we'll have to make an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| And so we know that there's never going to be a year where we go down, okay, in assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| And so there will be some corrections that come through that equalization board, and that's to be expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=774)|
| 0:13:03| There's also some growth that's always built into reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| They'll let you count your new growth for four years or whatever, and there's a calculation that goes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| I think no matter what, you're always going to see us with an annual growth of 1.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| I just think during reappraisal that chance to move that needle from 1.5 to 2 percent or 2.25 is probably there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| And they'll tell you, the state will tell you that reappraisal is a zero-sum game in the aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| That's true to a point, but there's always some room there for growth because you're going to set your tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=815)|
| 0:13:44| and you get to either round up or you round down if you don't go out four pennies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| And so there's some room either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| You will never see us, though, how we budget where we would come out on the losing end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| You mentioned the rounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| I know in Knox County rounds to two, and the state allows you to go to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| which is probably pennies for a homeowner but an aggregate to the county of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Okay, so let's just go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| It can hurt you or harm you, so I'll give you two examples, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Let's assume that the tax rate comes back and they say the new tax rate should be 2.0861.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=860)|
| 0:14:29| Let's pick a number, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Well, the state, nine times that out of ten, will say, okay, you can round that number to 209, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| If you're 20848, they're not going to let you round up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| They're going to make you round down or stay if you would go out four decimal points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| So if we round down, which we have in the past, we've had both, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| So it basically works its way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| But for us to round down 4.8, right, to lose that .0048 is a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| You think about it, our penny on the tax rate is 1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| So while a county may be like Scott County, that's not a big number to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| A county like us, it is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| But we have historically chosen just to go to the two decimal spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=920)|
| 0:15:33| As a homeowner, you probably not want to fill those extra two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Either way, I mean, either way, when it's round up or round down, you're not going to fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| But the state does allow you to go to four if you will go to the state's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| and see what counties and cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| It's about split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I mean, it's split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| I know the city goes to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| We go to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| So are you saying if you go to four, you may have the possibility of having to round all the way down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| You wouldn't on four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| You do on two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| So if you stay with two, the advantage is you get to round up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| The disadvantage is you've got to round down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| If you stay to the fourth, I was going to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| And as you know, with assessments, they round to the nearest dollar anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Where have we fallen in the, what is it, three assessments we've had now as a state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| I can, let me, I will say I know the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| The last two were down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| The last two, we've had one apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Four years ago, we were at 232.48, and we had to round down to 232.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| I think the year before that, that came down to 236.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| We were at 236.64 and got to round up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| So like I said, it probably evens out over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| I mean, where do you fall on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Anybody else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| You don't have any phone calls, have you, over reappraisal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| Ed would like to make his phone call right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Ed, do you want to make your phone call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I think he's going to meet us outside in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| Oh, can we complain now to you or do we have to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| I will tell you, Commissioner, I have nothing to do with reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| I just budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| That's all I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| One, this call I got yesterday, this gentleman who seemed to be well informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| I don't understand how my taxes can go up $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| And I said, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| So obviously he's misreading the yellow sheet completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| His assessment may have went up $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| His assessment could have went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| And so, I mean, that's what the equalization board's there for, and, you know, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| I was giving Shouse a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Shouse just collects, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| He just collects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1078)|
| 0:17:58| He just takes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| And so, and I will say, I've said it before, they do a great job of collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Ninety-six percent in year one is quite amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Hey, Chris, I just was going to tell them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| I did not tell them to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I did not call them to call our trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| I just called our property assessor, John Whitehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| and scheduled a meeting in my district already for Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| John said he'll, he's more than glad to come and explain it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| I've had a few phone calls, but nothing that I can do anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| And next we have our new superintendent, Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| I'm going to ask Gary to work his way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| I think there's a handout there for you, but before Gary talks about the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| I just want to let you know that the board last week did approve a budget, general operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| actually a capital budget and school nutrition budget that we've submitted to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| and worked with Chris and his folks on our projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| and certainly appreciate the fine relationship we have with Chris and his folks and with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| So there was considerable debate about the budget last week before it was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| but a $471,146,000 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Some of the main priorities in that budget, we're going to be able to enhance teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| and staff compensation this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| There's funding in there to support the Disparities in Education Outcome Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| some cultural competency training for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I think we'll get 55 schools trained next year and then the remainder of the year after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Also, we'll be employing mental health workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| or assistants with mental health backgrounds in our middle school and high schools to help in that regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| and then also open up a welcome center for English language learner families to get them directed in the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| to get their children into schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| We're continuing the investment in transportation, $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Last year was the first year of a three-year march to put an investment in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| So this is year two, so $1.2 million in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| And then, as you know, we're opening up two new middle schools in the fall, not next fall, but the fall after, fall of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| So there are funds there to hire, go ahead and put in place a couple of principals, one for each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| and some clerical support and then a guidance counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Just one thing about the salaries, what we're looking at, the board's looking at right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| would be a 3% increase for teachers, the classroom teachers and certified folks, also a 3% for classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1259)|
| 0:21:08| And one group of classified employees are going to be receiving a little bit more than that are educational assistants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| who are really grossly underpaid, so we're adding actually a dollar on the hour to their salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| So at the entry level, I think that works out to about 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| and at the top step, about 6.75% of a salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| So, again, I feel very good about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| I wish we talked about 4% raise for teachers, and that's what's in the memorandum of understanding with our teacher association is 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1293)|
| 0:21:43| But with the funding as it is right now, it looks like 3% is where we are with that teacher raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| So I just wanted to kind of give you an update on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| I know that wasn't necessarily part of Gary's report, but since that was pretty recent in terms of board action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1313)|
| 0:22:02| I wanted to update you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| And I don't know if you have any questions about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| Maybe get Gary on up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Mr. Thomas, quickly, I got an e-mail and some other questions outside of this e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| Some of the cuts that have been coming, discussions of cuts, I guess, that have been coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| I guess, could you explain to me a little bit about the assistive technology cuts at Cedar Bluff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| And then also I want to talk a little, you know, the concept or the thinking behind, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| when Austin East and Fulton start excelling and then we start cutting back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| And so talk about those cuts as well, and I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Yes, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| There's been some discussion about, I think, three assistive technology positions that were repurposed within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| That came from the recommendation from our executive director, Ms. Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Part of that is the services that we're delivering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| She had actually been looking at this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| She was the one that put the model into place a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| She's been looking at that since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| We feel like that with the existing personnel or she feels like with existing personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| that we can actually expand the training, I mean, expand the services to more students, doing it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| She really needed to repurpose because the general purpose budget needed to pick up some special education teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| So what she was looking at is a way to continue with the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| but doing it in a different delivery model to help her pick up the equivalent of about three teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| So there are positions that these folks could, will be available for these folks to go for, to apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| Yeah, the e-mail come from a parent, not a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| And so it's a concerned autistic parent of an autistic child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Yes, and I've had discussions with Ms. Massey about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| And she feels like that actually we're going to be able to pick up what we deliver to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| So she's had this plan in place for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| So we don't intend for the services to be decreased to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| And actually we intend for the service to be delivered across the district even better than it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| And that's not to take away from what these three people have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| But I'm still meeting with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| We'll be meeting with her again for a more detailed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| But she assures me that we're not going to reduce services that we've been providing to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| And, yes, the situation at Fulton and Austin East with some reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| and additional resources were put into both schools at a time when we restructured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| So now that they've made the gains, what the thinking is that we can pull back on some of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| That concerns me a bit because I certainly don't want us to pull out what's helped us to get to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| So, again, I'm still looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| I met with the principal at Austin East, Ms. Dethridge, and Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| and I met with the principal at Austin East a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| And he expressed some concerns about the staffing formula and what he was losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| So I hope to be looking at that to see if we can more strategically maybe not pull out as many positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1522)|
| 0:25:33| I think they were slated to lose eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| I believe stability provision was formed to lose four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| But certainly he's concerned, you know, about losing four positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| So I'm still looking at that, Commissioner, working with staff to see if we can further mitigate any losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| And really, I guess in my mind, what allowed us to improve and whatever allowed us to improve to where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1551)|
| 0:26:01| let's make sure we don't pull that back to the point that we go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| We can't afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| And really, I guess, since I've come on commission, we've got about a hundred more million dollars a year invested in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| So where are these cuts coming from or where are these teachers going is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Well, there will be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| There's the end of contract for some teachers because we're looking at a reduction in title programs of about 13 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1581)|
| 0:26:31| Title one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Title one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Part of the positions there are end of contract just because, again, being on soft money and title one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| certainly the teachers will be able to apply for vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| I can't say that every teacher will get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Also, the other reductions were due to staffing formula reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| Basically, what we tried to do this year is adhere more closely to the staffing formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| In years past, we might have been a little bit more generous to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| and not asking them to make the cuts as much as we're asking them to make this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| But it's just it has to do basically with student enrollment and just the shifts in enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| So those reductions, there are some tenured teachers involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| What we're working to do is to make sure that we have those tenured teachers placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| My goal is to try to have that done by the end of school so that when teachers leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| they know where they'll be working and they can actually leave and enjoy their vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| and rest and relax over the summer because we're going to come back hardcore starting in fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| So try to have those placed by the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Dr. Thomas, on the AT technology, these are employees that are PTs and OTs, physical therapists and nurses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1665)|
| 0:27:57| That have had specialized training in how to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| and help these children with these disabilities use this equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Is the plan just to train more of them, our current staff of PTs and OTs and LBNs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| They, according to what Ms. Massey has told me, they have a certain amount of training right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| So there will be additional training for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| And in terms of the technology piece, I'm working with our chief technology officer, Ms. Gail Byard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| She had asked for a couple of positions that would be specifically nothing but technology positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| So we're kind of looking at that as well in terms of having the backup for the technology piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| but then the OTs and PTs actually increasing their capacity so that we can serve more students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1726)|
| 0:28:55| So that's the overall goal is to just have more training for more people to be able to apply this to more students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Increasing the transportation budget by a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| I think we have roughly 60-some-odd contractors and 300-something buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| And with the million dollars last year and the million dollars this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I think that's close to a 15 percent increase going just towards the contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| And I think you all have committed to another year of a million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| How close will you think that will get us to where we need to be in terms of being able to pay people enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| to find reasonable people to do these jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| There might be others to argue with me on this, but I think that gets us to where we need to be next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| because there were years when resources were not placed in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| I know there were years where increases were asked for, but with budget cuts and restraints and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| those increases weren't provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I think we got to a point with our contractors where it was difficult to hire drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| It was difficult to maintain the equipment like it needs to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| And actually, of course, they're in business to make a little bit of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| so there has to be a profit, a little bit of a profit margin for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| So we've about squeezed them out of business, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| But we feel like with one more year of a million-dollar increase that we're going to be where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| And I think that's pretty much what came out of the studies, two independent studies, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| that were done back after the tragic bus accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| And on the salaries for teachers, they're certified and classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| It's a the whole step, the whole scale gets a 3 percent raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| And then in addition to that, each employee gets a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| So it's actually a step and 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| It is, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| There's, I think, about 21 percent, roughly 21 percent of our employees are topped out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| meaning that they're at the top of the step, which basically they would get a 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| But you're correct, if I was on step 10 this year, then I will go to step 11, so I'll get that increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| plus I will get the 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| So it's actually a step and a 3 percent raise for a significant portion of our certified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| And for a lot of them, that is going to fall in the 4 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Yes, sir, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| And, again, it just varies because there's different step increases are different across the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| I would say somewhere around 5 percent, maybe, and Gary might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| But roughly that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| So there could be some that get a little bit less and might be some that even get a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Hey, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Yeah, hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Just to go back to one of Commissioner Anders' points, just to really clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| and I'm going to go ahead and send you an e-mail just so we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| What I suspect is most of the commissioners may have gotten the same e-mail about cuts to the assistive technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| I've reread the e-mail, and I think I'm putting myself in the shoes of the parent who's one of our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| who maybe at first glance maybe it sounded almost like some of the technology may be removed from the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| when maybe what it could be is some of the head counts that were designated with teaching it are going to be put somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| So I guess what I'd ask is, you know, kind of clarify for that we can get back to this one of our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| that we're not talking about removing the technology from the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| that this change is more about changing the way you're training the folks out in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| That's how I've read it, but I want some clarification from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| That's absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| It's not to remove the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| So let me be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| It would be helpful if you don't mind sharing the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| I've got all I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Yeah, I'd be glad for us to address, to specifically address that parent, too, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| And, again, not in any kind of manner other than to be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| But, yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| The technology piece of that is still going to be in place for our students who need that technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| I just wanted to return to the number of teachers that are going to be impacted by, as we rifted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| How many teacher positions are we speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| Gosh, Commissioner, I think on the, it was probably around 60 maybe in terms of staffing, about 45 or 6 of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2008)|
| 0:33:41| maybe tenured positions that I was talking about being placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| On the Title I, let me get a number for you on that on the end of contract because I hate to quote a number to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2026)|
| 0:33:55| But I think it was, Gary, do you know the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| It might have been somewhere around 106, 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| But let me get both numbers for you so I don't misspeak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| I think we're concerned that we affect tenured teachers in schools that are, have made tremendous gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2048)|
| 0:34:18| And that will impact the, you know, the students, your classes, your class sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| the program support for those students, and obviously, you know, the teacher placement itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| So it just impacts students across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| And I know one of your priorities is to make sure we maintain, you know, the gains we've already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| And I'm still certainly working towards that as we, one piece of the information that's missing at this point, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| is we've projected our state revenue, basic education program numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| I think maybe an estimate did come in for April, but I'm not, I haven't, okay, Gary's not seen it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| But we get four estimates from the state for the BEP, basic education program formula funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| The first comes in April, then May, June, July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| The July is the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Maybe, you know, again, if we've under-projected, and I don't know that we have or haven't at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| but, you know, if we've under-projected state revenue, then maybe it's a possibility of some additional revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| that would, could be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| I know we want to be careful about utilizing additional revenue, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| but two new schools coming up in the fall of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| But certainly a concern for me is to not go backwards with the gains we've made at the schools that we've really put resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| into and helped get them to where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And that's a huge concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| On your capital improvement plan for the next three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| you've got a little over $4 million targeted for security upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| What does that entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| The camera systems at our schools, because it, again, depending on the size of the campus and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| I think primarily most of that is replacement of camera systems that have gotten outdated and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| I didn't bring that capital plan with me, but just from my memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| that's what most of it, I mean, you spend, it costs quite a bit of money to outfit a large campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| high school campus with cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| And then also you've got the, what you classify as, how is it listed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| as system-wide drives, parking and paving, a half a million dollars that you don't want to do until FY20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| Are you also painting the stripes for the parking spaces at our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| Where we would do paving, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| And it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| And, again, I'd have to look at that list to see what's exactly specified there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| But it can include striping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| It can include repaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| It's not enough money to do everything we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| But, again, we try to hit the places that are the most urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| And the other thing I noticed, it looks like next year you're going to do some significant cafeteria upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| at Powell High School and Middle School as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| That's been something that we've talked about in meetings before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| The middle school has got the area that's unfinished, and then at the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| also to make some provisions for a larger dining area to accommodate the students at Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2256)|
| 0:37:49| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Mr. Thomas, can we get a list of the schools that are planning on doing more cameras and security at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2272)|
| 0:38:02| Do they know or is there a list already that had the schools named?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Again, I didn't bring my backup information with me, but, yes, we would know where we're going to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| So I can get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Yeah, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I want to thank you for looking at those two schools in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| How will that, in improving the high school there, will that give us more opportunity to get classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| where we're not doing classes around lunchtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Yeah, Gary just informed me, too, that those are placeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| The money is not there yet, but there's placeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| I believe it was a million and a half for Powell Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| Yeah, and maybe over three million, I believe, for Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| But to answer your question, I think it includes shifting the administrative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| building some administrative offices, so freeing up more space for a commons area like we have in some of our other high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| Well, my question was, they were having problems scheduling classes because we had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Yeah, what was it, six lunch periods or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| I'm with you, yes, because of I think there might have been six or seven shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| So, yes, that should address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| So, and the finishing of the Powell Middle School, that's the cafeteria, that's correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| Yes, that space that's unfinished right now, I don't believe there's any HVAC in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| and it's got a gravel floor, but it would be outfitting the kitchen equipment and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And it's a million and a half dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Yeah, I think I was right, maybe three and a half at Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| Again, I'm going from memory on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Dr. Thomas, with the two new schools coming online, these teachers that are being ripped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| will they be given any priority if their qualifications meet middle school criteria when those schools do open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| We're going to be talking about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| I know the last time we opened a new middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| part of the reason we're getting the principals on board is to help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| But there will be a certain amount of teachers, staff that will move with the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| but then there will also quite likely be some additional positions that people can apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| and go through the interview process with the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| And I just wanted to comment for my fellow commissioners on the camera security systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| Systems in our schools, some of them are very old, some of them are fairly new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| but they do a lot more than just security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| They help us with liability and a whole lot of other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2452)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| I have one other inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Could you talk about your recommendations, your new recommendations on the disparity that will be included in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| proposal aside from training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I know training is the biggest one for the staff for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| What else is involved in the disparities committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| We are looking at, and I think part of the recommendation was some personnel with background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| and training in mental health issues to help from a behavioral standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Some of our students, of course, need more resources than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| but those positions will be in the middle schools and in the high schools, in each middle school and each high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| That should help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| The thinking is that that's going to help us, too, with the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| behavioral issues and discipline issues and those kinds of situations that occur in the middle and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2509)|
| 0:41:57| Also, anything that we can do that's not going to cost money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| like with the positive behavior intervention strategies and restorative training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| we're going to continue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| I know some of our schools have actually put some things, some strategies in place that are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| that are not costing any additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| I think Bearden Middle School maybe is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Assistant Principal talked with me about it and having some real good effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| We're going to explore that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Anything we can do that's not going to cost anything, make that a priority, obviously, for our other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Dr. Thomas, I want to tell you congratulations, and also we look forward to working with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| And it's Bob or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| I mean, I don't have a doctorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| I've got plenty of education, but not that final piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| But you're welcome, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| I'm looking forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Like I said, I've been around a while working with commissions, and I haven't sat in your seat, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| but I do know the pressures that you're under to fund all the pieces of government that have to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| And, you know, education takes a big share of that and a big chunk of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| and you've always been really great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I plan on continuing to work with you and trying to help you make your job as easy as I can possibly make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| because I know it's very difficult with what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| And thank you for what you do and for serving our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2611)|
| 0:43:43| Well, that's going to be hard to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| So just to follow up on a couple of things that Bob said, once the mayor releases his proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2625)|
| 0:43:56| we will invite each of you to come to the school district to sit with your school board member, if you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2636)|
| 0:44:05| and we will go through the budget in detail with you and answer the sorts of questions that you've had tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| The other thing is on the disparities, there were a couple of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| one of them being the ombudsman position that was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| And it has been filled, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| The assistant principal from Austin East has taken that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| And also the plans for a welcome center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| One of the issues that the district has is when the district receives students that transfer in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| essentially they're told, go to the school where you're zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| But that doesn't really address the needs of that student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| whether that's a matter of English language learners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| or it's someone who's coming from out of district and we have no record on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| And this welcome center will be designed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| We'll be designed for a place for these individual students with their families to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| to see what their needs are and to see where they should actually be placed in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| So we're looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| It's not a real high-cost item, but trying to find a place to put it right now is one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2707)|
| 0:45:19| And on BEP, as Bob said, we haven't gotten the first indication of what that's going to be for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| We do our best guess at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| and we're guessing at about a $9.5 million increase over this previous year or over this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| But as Chris was talking about tax collections, that's one of those things as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| that he and I, primarily he, does projections of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| and then we sit down and look at the numbers and try to see where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| And all of this is in flux, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Looking at the current year, you should have received a brief handout on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| and give you just a quick update on where we stand this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| When we look at revenues and local option sales tax collections, you didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| We sent it out last week, so sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| We sent it by e-mail to the lady who sets the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2785)|
| 0:46:41| Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2801)|
| 0:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Sorry about that, but we sent it out last Tuesday or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| We'll get it to you, but just briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| the things that we're talking about now are the same things we talked about last quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Sales tax collections are looking good for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| We're projecting about a $2.5 million increase in those over budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| which will get us up to about $458 million in total revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| But the issues we're facing are the same issues that I talked about the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| around, the big one being our medical insurance premiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| and we're still looking at about a $2.5 million over budget there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| as well as in what we call unbudgeted positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| Those are positions that are established once the school year starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| We got the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| It came in on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| So when we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| we're seeing now a projection of a surplus for the year of about $850,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| or $873,000, which is $850,000 above where we were at the end of the last quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| I was going to go back to the Welcome Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| You know, is it going to be in a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Is it going to be at the Sarah Miller Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| I mean, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Right now we're looking at Austin East High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| because Austin East has plenty of capacity that's not being used from the level of enrollment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| The other option is looking to the community for someone with a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| a benefactor, to buy a building and let us use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| But in Sam Hill, is there a room at Sammy Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| Well, the one thing we're looking for as well is bus accessibility, the bus routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| and Austin East works really well for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| I was just trying to make sure we weren't recreating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| You know, Lonsdale, obviously, that area has a large population of non-English speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| and others not far from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| I did a quick data study of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Actually, it's been about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| and there were third grade classes where a teacher would walk in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| and more than half of the students didn't speak English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| So I've tried to put myself in that third grade teacher's shoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| and try to figure out what you're going to do at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| I was just kind of curious to make sure we weren't ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| because there's plenty of space that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| but I understand that the bus would be the most smart move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| One thing that one spot that had been considered was there's a building behind Vine Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| that has a medical center in it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| but with the rezoning for Gibbs and Hardin Valley that are going to go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| Vine's going to increase in enrollment significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| So there was just no space there then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| Gary, are you not also looking at a possible increase in insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| health insurance from the state again next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| In the governor's budget, he included a 6.9% increase in the rates for 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| which we've tried to factor into the budget for 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| and we've actually increased the budget for health insurance by $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| and added up over $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| Because the 6.9% increase last year turned out to be more along the lines of 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Yes, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that we can ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| that it's not 14 this time around because if it is, we're ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| I don't know what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Same boat again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Yes, same boat again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| It was the same leaking, the same holes trying to plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| But as Bob talked about, even if revenues do come in higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| we're looking at two new middle schools coming online in the next year, the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| And, you know, the comments can be made, well, you can shift staff around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| they can staff the schools, but that just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I mean, you've got a whole new ‑‑ two new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| You've got administrative staff for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| You've got custodial staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| You have maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| You have security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| You have utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| You have on and on down the line, which just ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| it's not a zero‑sum game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| So what is the actual operating cost increase by adding these two schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| net the effect of some shifts that can be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Yeah, you can't hold me to this, but it's probably going to be in the three to four million dollar range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| Per school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| No, I hope that we can do it for both schools, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| That's pretty optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| And the debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Debt service is what Chris talked about, the $99 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| You guys are floating 60, I think 63 million of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| On our side, to pay for these two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| And if you look at the capital plan, that was the other comment I was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| That capital plan, the numbers to look at are the bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| because those are locked in under the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| So even though it's just $10 million for FY18, five of that's going to finish up projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| these two middle schools plus the Pond Gap project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| So it doesn't leave a whole lot of money for security cameras or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| NSCIP was also finishing it up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Wasn't it on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Yeah, the NSCIP project is part of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| Does anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Do you have anything else, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3142)|

| 0:55:56| The reason that we need them added to this month's agenda is that they're time sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3356)|
| 0:56:06| and if we do not have them added and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| then the Board of Education cannot act on certain contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| which are things that we need to get done or they need to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3373)|

| 0:56:41| This is resolution 114 will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| That's a resolution approving the appointment of Stuart Blackstock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| and James Beck as hearing officers in Knoxville Board of Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3414)|

| 0:57:12| and abuse hotline coming from the audit committee to change the responsibility of the fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3432)|

| 1:04:03| And I think, bear with me just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3843)|
| 1:04:11| Item 40 for the litter grant, I'd like a little clarification on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3851)|
| 1:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Item 54 also, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Item 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3869)|
| 1:04:51| Any other items to be discussed today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3891)|
| 1:05:03| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Consent be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Motion before us is that consent be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Motion is properly before us to have the consent set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| The first item is on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Item number nine is discussion of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| appointing Jim Wright, Jr. as a member and as an alternate member to the Knox County Sheriff's Office Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| This is resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Do I hear a motion for forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| I have two candidates' information to go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| The two candidates are not here today but will be with us at the meeting Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| I'll say this today and I'll say it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| Jim Wright is a close personal friend and I stand behind him 100 percent on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3964)|
| 1:06:12| Both candidates will be here for full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| The motion before us is Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| How was the candidate selected from the merit board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| Did we as a merit board present those to us, but did they do that as a public notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3986)|
| 1:06:36| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| I think this is the first one I've ever been involved in and that's why I was just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| I think sometimes Commissioner or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Jim Wright had been an alternate member and then as a position opened up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| this is to allow him to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| He is the one that is moving up from an alternate member to a member of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| It's the two names that are being offered are alternate member names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| Correct, but how did the two alternates find out about the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| I do not know how the merit system council submits its recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| That's not how it always is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| There's always an alternate member and then the next year the alternate member moves up into a spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| and you keep moving up like this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| His question relates to how does the merit system council select the new names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4047)|
| 1:07:36| for those that are going to be alternate members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| I do not know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| The merit council doesn't actually select it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| You just put in your application, your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| How do you know when to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| I think it's like all the other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| It's on Knox County's website as to what terms that you serve and when it expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4071)|
| 1:08:01| Probably in the sheriff's thing, they have an interest or they're involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| For me, you're with that with a friend or family that may have told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| The merit system council makes the recommendations to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4093)|
| 1:08:29| The motion before us is to send to full commission without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4109)|
| 1:08:39| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| Madam Clerk, item 114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| This is a resolution approving the appointments of Stuart B. Blackstock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| and James Jim Beck as hearing officers for the Knox County Board of Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4137)|
| 1:09:06| That's item 114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| It does not have an item number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| It's resolution 114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| It's the one that has been prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| I think the reason that we have this one before us is the appointments need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| so that whoever is appointed can attend training in connection with this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4168)|
| 1:09:42| The motion before us is to send to full commission without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| On page six, item number 20 is approving a sub-grant agreement with Battelle Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| for the acceptance of a grant award in the amount of $36,000 for the Knox County School STEM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| to act as a STEM hub in the Tennessee STEM Innovation Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| This is resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I think it's a tremendous opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| I just wanted to see which schools were going to be involved in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| since we had more than one school designated as STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4224)|
| 1:10:35| Hi, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| I just walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Who asked the specific question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| Was it you, Ms. Geale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| My name is Daphne Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I work with Knox County Schools in the Office of Innovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| and it is not for the L&M STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| This is a revival of the regional hub through the state and the Battelle Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| And so it benefits all of the schools in our district along with all of the other regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| So this is a leadership opportunity for our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| We can put on the professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| We can be leaders in all of the resources and workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| We get to invite other regions to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| But we're hosting, and so we're excited to revive the hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| But it's not for one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| It's actually for all the schools as well as the surrounding districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| I couldn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| A little bit of the horse before the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Commissioner Geale, did you make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| I think that's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Is there any further discussion of this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| If not, the motion before us is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Item number 21 is approving the participation of the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| in the Sprint's One Million Project Program for the provision of free wireless connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| and devices to economically disadvantaged students at the Austin East Magnet High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| Carter High, Central High, and Fulton High Schools, resolution 210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| Commissioner Geale, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| And I have just one question regarding the connectivity and the devices for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4335)|
| 1:12:26| Is it our devices or they're going to provide devices for the students to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| And can those devices be taken into the homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| I see that wasn't real clear, so I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| So Sprint got in touch with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Based on free and reduced lunch percentages, they identified these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| If you look at the options, it does say the word device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| So we have actually looked at most of our schools are doing such a great job of having one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| Those devices will be what we call hotspots, which will allow internet wireless access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| The purpose of the grant is not to provide a device, not a smart tablet or device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| It's to provide internet access in the homes, which is why we're so excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| So many of our schools, especially in our Title I schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| are doing a fantastic job of building capacity with their technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| but the students can't access the internet once they go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| And so this is going to allow our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| And so, yes, the hotspots do go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| That's the purpose of the grant, to not only support the students, but to support the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| And Sprint has been amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| They came to our district and asked us to apply for this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| Also, in case it's kind of a strange number, if you look, you'll see different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| Ms. Gill's already on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| She's nodding her head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| You see different numbers for different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| That's because we had to take a percentage of the percentage of free and reduced lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| to allow us to determine how many devices each school would receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| Commissioner Geale, and your motion was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| So move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4440)|

| 1:14:21| The one that could be the most important one that we could recognize today, if anyone wanted to talk, is item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4469)|

| 1:14:38| and Robert M. Bob Thomas as director of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Again, congratulations on your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| Super Bob, because you must remember I promoted him in title from plain old Bob title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| plain old Bob to Super Bob sometime past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| Congratulations on your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4501)|

| 1:15:14| and your willingness to make sure we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| and that we're able to work together with you going forward in your contract as superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| This is not on our agenda to approve today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you and other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| if anyone is seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4534)|

| 1:17:20| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| The reason this one is being moved through quickly is that the language being taught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| if this contract is not approved now, the funding would be moved to a different school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| We would not receive it here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4655)|

| 1:18:05| This contract is not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| That's the reason we're pulling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Mr. Law Director, when do you think we will read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| The only issues are there are substantive from a legal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| but the numbers and everything and the services are pretty much what is in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| We have some venue jurisdictions and choice of law negotiations to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| and we'll have it ready for you by county commission, regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| Substantively, it is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| Motion before us is no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4722)|

| 1:18:51| Page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Item 32 is approving Amendment 2 to Contracts with Syracuse Technologies, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| for the provision of an inmate communications and management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| which amendment provides for the acquisition of up to an additional 900 tablets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| in the amount of $425 per tablet with the Knox County agreeing to forfeit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| its commission payments for securities for the inmate use of email and messaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| for the extent necessary to offset additional costs requiring the tablets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Yeah, just some clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| This is asking for up to 900 more tablets with a no commission on purchase of up to 900 tablets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| How many tablets do we have out there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Three hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Three hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| So you got any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Are you going by the 900?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| We're going by best case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| Inmate to tablet where we're doing a ratio of one to four when we first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| This is a very new technology for jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| We're leading the edge on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| We found that we needed more so more inmates could have them in their hands at more amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| because you have to factor in charging times and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| So the biggest complaint we had was they didn't have enough in their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| And we use these things for communications for so many things in our jails now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| letting us know about grievances, letting us know about their medical needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| We just don't see there's a way we can go without having at least a ratio of one to one available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| so we can say we're not denying the access to tell us their problems and needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| How long does an inmate have this tablet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Is it 24 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| And I guess the second part of the question is what can they access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| What they have right now they can have for 15 minutes at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| And after 15 minutes they have what's called a cool down period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| They can't access it again for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| With this provision, if we get more tablets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| there won't be what's called a go pass requiring them to purchase anything to keep it on their person for 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| This way it will be more applicable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| The revenues that we come in for right now are emails right now is what comes in off this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| And we're doing around 80,000 of them a month right now with not having enough emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| We believe the offset of that coming into the money is pretty much an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| because we'll have more email money coming in, more visitation, more video call money at the long end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| so they won't be sitting on a charger charge and it will actually be being used in their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| So that's the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| So it's just really email between family members, I guess, or friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| Email family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Anybody they need to talk to if they want to talk to their attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| they can talk to their attorneys sometimes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| And they have family visits through video visits as well on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| Would you, just for information purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| what would be the commission off of that that would be savings to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| The commission off of what, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| I think it says here that it will forfeit the commission off the sale of the new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| What we're taking, forfeiting the commission off the email portion only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| The email portion right now, it's 40 cents a email back and forth each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| And we get 50 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| The county gets 50 percent of each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Right now we're averaging $14,000 to $15,000 a month is what you're making off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| I just wanted to get that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Let me get your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Terry Wilshire, 5001 Maloneyville Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Yes, Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Can you tell us were these tablets put out for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| $425 is high for a tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| I mean, they're available for $100, $125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| Why are they $425?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| The tablets, the original $300 were given with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| We got them for zero cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| It didn't cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| The tablet itself, you write your $250 or $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| They also include the software that's driven on them or the technology added on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| plus an indestructible case that's put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| It's manufactured especially for an M.A. tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| You can't just put a regular tablet from Walmart in a sale because it would get destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| So it's got value-added features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Hey, Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| I think I got a little confused whenever Carson was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| So we're giving up the commission to use to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| So there's no out-of-pocket money that we're using to purchase these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Or is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| We're forfeiting the commission to pay for the until they're paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| Or how long are we forfeiting the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Only forfeiting until we get the number of tablets needed up to 900,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| which is the way the language is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| So we could stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| If we got 500 up to 500, we say operating looks like it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| We don't need any extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| We could stop it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| Commission's come back in the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| We restart up with the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| And there's language in there for future in case we, at the end of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| we needed some more, we could actually forfeit like for one month at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| and buy some extras if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Next question is social media or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Or is it just e-mail and contact with their attorneys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Very controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| There's no social media on these things at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| We don't want them getting out and getting in contact with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| Fully controlled also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| It's not a true e-mail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| It's more of a messaging system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Every message goes out as filtered going out and filtered coming back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| So it's nothing like a true e-mail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| They can get to victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| People say they don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| All they got to do is get on their e-mail and say, I don't want this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| They don't get anything from the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| And my next question is they're in a tough box, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| Are those guaranteed by the company, the indestructible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| and they're going to replace them if they get broke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| There's no guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| They've replaced everyone we've ever had any problems with and we've had this program over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| We've had tablets for over two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| We've had probably less than 10 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Anything happen to them, they've replaced every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Normally with 300 and then adding 900, that would give us 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| How many with uptime and downtime from charging would that have in circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| within the detention facility at any given time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| We'll put all 1,200 out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| The problem is if you have four or 500 inmates, got them in their cells and they use them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| use the battery time down, you have to have that relief factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| While one's on a charger, they can be using it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| That's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| How many would that mean will have in use at any given time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| All of them could be used at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| This company actually gave us a network that will support that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| As many as they want to be on at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| Every inmate could have a ratio to one to one if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| That was the whole purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| You'll probably never have that because you'll have some inmates that don't use them as much as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| Some are power users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| We have some that keep them 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| They're continuously checking them out, using them for their law director or law library on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| using them for contacting family, friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Okay, I guess that's what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| With 1,200, will there be enough commissions to pay for 1,200 if they're not getting 100% utility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| Will there be enough commissions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| That's how they're being paid for is off the e-mails, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| Oh, I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| Yes, it'll take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| What we're averaging, honestly, I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Right now, if it's $14,000 to $15,000 a month we're going to forfeit, that's how many tablets we'll buy at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| We'll forfeit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| They'll send us 35 to 40 tablets until we get to a point where we need to be, then our commission starts back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| I'm sorry, I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Okay, so I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| You're just going to buy them with your current commissions that are derived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| It was better to do that than try to go into money and try to use taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| So the inmates are literally paying for it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| And is there any kind of maintenance contract on these to keep them running properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| For the network, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| They have a continuous network that's contained by the company as far as the tablets themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| We've added a one-year warranty on there that's on there, just like any other tablet you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| It's got a one-year warranty against defects or manufactured defects and wear or tear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| And I guess it's we look around and we think we should have one-to-one technology in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| and here we have it with our inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| But I think there are some other benefits to this besides idle hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| These people are sitting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| It gives them something to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| It gives them a way to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| It could have some very positive things, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Yes, studies across the nation, everybody that's going to these kind of technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| So they don't have idle hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| They're not getting in trouble with reduction in incident reports, reductions of fights, reductions of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| And they've become quite dependent on these things because they have such another great contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| with their outside loved ones and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| It's like they can stay in contact so much better than they used to in the old days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| In fact, they don't use phones as much as they use these things, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| And so it's become a great tool for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| And not only just for them, for us maintaining us, making sure we stay accredited facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| We get all the information they ask about problems or grievances they may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| or issues they want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| We direct those directly to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| For example, someone is interested in one of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| What used to be they had to write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| They went to two or three hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Well, now when a program comes up and they want to go on a program, they go on the tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| They type in their interest and the next business day they've got an answer about being on a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| So we're getting to programs quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| We're getting to education better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| We're actually going to be adding some other educational means on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| So it's overall it's been a win-win for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| We've got agencies across the nation that come in and see how we're doing here at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| We're proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| We're forefronters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| What brand of tablets are we currently using and will it still be the same brand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| The company has went to a different brand name which was an improvement over memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| and also the charging capacities on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| And it escapes me the exact name brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| It's not like Samsung or anything like that because the company actually gets the tablet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| and they take everything off of it that comes on it from the factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| It's a Windows tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| They actually load it with their software so it's very secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| They can't get out to the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| It's all locked down and within their connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| So there's nothing on it but just their software once they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| So it's not like you go out and you buy a Samsung or you buy an Apple or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| So it's just an Apple tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| They take everything off of it and they do it their own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| So it's secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| Captain, how much are we making a month right now off email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| Right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| Commission off email alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Between $14,000 and $15,000 a month for our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| We get 50 percent of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| We're bringing 15 in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| I'd like to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| After we get all these tablets paid for, what do you think our commission will be monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| Estimation-wise, I mean, we're doing about 80,000 messages a month right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| I'm guessing we'll go to 100,000 to 120,000 at least, that may be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| just based on the number of people that don't have access to them while they're on downtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| So it will increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| We've had months that went as far as 85,000 messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Just for clarification, 15 is the gross, so we're getting $7,500, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| No, we're getting the full amount of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| So we are getting $14,000 or $15,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| That's what I wanted to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| That is actually the amount we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| I was trying to do math in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| No, that's Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Oh, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| PBA, my light's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| Now this $15,000 or $14,000, is that going into your general fund for expenditures just for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| It goes to Knox County General Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| It goes to Knox County General Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Do you have on the light, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| No, that's Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| I can see Carson's hands and the light went out, so it wasn't Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| But currently, we're going to use that $14,000 now to purchase more tablets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Thank you, Captain Wilshire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| On page 10, item 36, is a resolution approving a proposal of the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5460)|
| 1:31:09| to construct a project design as federal project number STP-NHE-11529,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5469)|
| 1:31:18| state project number 47026-1270-14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| and described as SR-115-US-129 Alcoa Highway from Woodson Road to south end of Tennessee Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5484)|
| 1:31:33| This is resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Since this is Alcoa Highway and everybody's concerned about Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| this is the new construction from Woodson to UT Hospital exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| I'm pretty sure Norris County does not have to have any monetary on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| I just wanted you to explain it so anybody watching and I get a question, I know what to tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| You're exactly right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| There is no financial cost to the county in this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| The only thing is the, I guess, the access roads that will be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| Alcoa Highway will be going from two lane to at grade intersections to a three lane interstate access control facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5536)|
| 1:32:25| That access control involves connecting some side roads with what's called frontage roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| Those roads that are inside the county, some will be inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| The ones that are inside the county, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| this agreement sets up the mechanism for us to maintain those once the state completes the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| So that's pretty much the general summary of what the agreement entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| It's just us maintaining those roads once the project's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5572)|

| 1:32:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| On page 11, item number 40 is a resolution authorizing the submission of an application for the fiscal year 2017-2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5582)|
| 1:33:11| little grant from the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| and if said application is approved, authorizing Knox County to enter into a grant contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| for the acceptance of the grant award in the amount up to $169,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| This is resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| Commissioner Daley asked that it be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| I recognize him first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Motion is good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| Zach or whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| Drew Thurman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| Yeah, Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| Apologize, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| No, no, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| We get confused a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Of course you know my soapbox is litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| And can you explain, this is a $169,000 grant from the state of Tennessee that we do not have to match this grant, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5640)|
| 1:34:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Every year it changes a little bit in terms of the total dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| and it funds for us to operate a roadside litter pickup program for state eligible roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5655)|
| 1:34:24| and it allows us to also buy supplies and fund some staff, operate vehicles and fuel maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| It's fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Part of the money has to be spent on education, about 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| and we actually have a contractor for that, Keep Knoxville Beautiful, does all the education portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| So this does pay for us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Currently we have three litter crew leaders that go out in the community and they take voluntary laborers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| Some of you know that we've had an issue with the DUI probationers being essentially eliminated when the state law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5697)|
| 1:35:07| But we've tried to replace those probationers by partnering with the drug recovery, veterans court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5707)|
| 1:35:19| the criminal court clerk, instituted a program for folks to work off their court fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| by also attending our voluntary pickup program, and there's the community alternatives to prison programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5726)|
| 1:35:35| We're trying to replace that lost labor from the mandatory DUI litter pickup sentencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| with other kind of voluntary self-reporting labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| But we have three crew leaders and a couple of different vehicles to take them out on a daily basis, Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| Now how's that working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Have you got the volunteers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| I know we're not got the 80,000 man hours that we lost because of the current DUI law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| Yeah, it's definitely been a hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| We used to have something like 112 folks a month, and we're down to where we're lucky to have 30 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5769)|
| 1:36:19| voluntary laborers to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| But the folks we're replacing them with are folks that maybe do a repeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| So if you're in the recovery court or in your community alternatives to prison program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| or the court clerk working your fees off, you might have several different times to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| instead of just three days and then you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| So the folks that we are getting are doing a really good job because they learn what they've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| They maybe come back once every week for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5804)|
| 1:36:55| But it's still been a challenge to find the amount of laborers we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| We think that about five per day, if we had five folks every day, that would be a really great number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| It allows us to respond to any of the litter pickup requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| And it is one of our most requested services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| People use the convenience centers, but most of the times they just want to know when they call us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| they want to know the hours of operation, stuff like that, what they can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| When our phone rings, most of the time if it's a request for some type of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| it is for us to examine and pick up some kind of roadside litter, dumping, tires, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| Is it correct that when the DUI law was changed in July that we lost, what was it, 137 or 138.60 per person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5856)|
| 1:37:47| Did we not charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| So there is a fee component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| I don't know if I can speak to that very well because the probation is who charged that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| You're talking about the revenue sharing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Yeah, I believe they did have to, in addition to having to serve those three shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| I do know they did have a, they had to pay to probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| and there was some revenue sharing with the department and that went back into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| So, yes, the answer, I believe, is yes, we have lost some revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| I don't know what that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| and I don't know whether it would be finance or probation would be able to speak exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| to the amount of lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Well, I'm still working on a few options for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| and spoke with the lieutenant governor a couple of times trying to get this law changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| where it would be hopefully an opt-in type situation for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| because we, in Knox County, we are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| Mr. Wright there done an excellent piece on the litter DUI back a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5920)|
| 1:38:47| He's going to come here tonight, give him a plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| So hopefully when I get ready, I'm going to call on this commission to let's get this law changed back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| to where we can get that 80,000 man hours back out there and help clean these roads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| We appreciate that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| We also appreciate, I know you and Commissioner Anders both do regular cleanups in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| We've had a lot of folks that call that are really angry about the litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| and we've definitely tried to channel that anger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| and explain that we're not the ones that put the litter on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| We're the ones that are actually one of the few folks that are being the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| to take the litter away from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| So we encourage anyone who is really concerned about it to volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| because there are folks that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| We have Adopt-A-Road programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| We are able to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Part of this litter grant does fund community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| that want to do regular litter pickups in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| I have to give Charlie's district a hand up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| but I'm a member of the Halls Crossroads Women's League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| and we have regular cleanups and all out there in Norris Freeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| and some of those dangerous roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| So this is just in the county in terms of the litter or does it come into the city park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| So the state has some rules about what's eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| They call them state aid roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| and essentially it's a county road that touches a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| Part of this grant does not require us to pick up the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| or actually the state highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| but if the road adjoins or connects to a state road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| then they become eligible under this litter grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| So there are activities that we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| We can't use this litter grant necessarily to assist someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| picking up a dump that's not on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| or like a stream cleanup, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| So we do have to keep some of those reporting separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| A good description of that would be in my district, Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| which in turn seems to be a city road, a county road, and a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| That's why we have so much trouble in trying to get some safety precautions out on Tassel Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| because it involves all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| and particularly with one of our elementary schools out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| And you mentioned the 30 percent education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| Is that going to be by printing material, commercials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| I mean, when we were growing up and going through school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| litter was a big thing that was taught in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| And that, to me, the education is really where all this starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| because when it's taught in the schools to the kids at a young age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| they are the biggest examples to their parents to not throw out the McDonald's bag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6104)|
| 1:41:51| the Burger King bag and whatever you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| And I've always been very big about that, but I'm married into a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| and, I mean, every one of them pick up trash down Shannondale Road, Tassel Pike, Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| all of the areas where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| And so I get asked this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Every family gets together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| When are you going to do something about the trash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| When are you going to do something about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| So when this came across, I was glad Carson beat me to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| In terms of how are we going to do the education, I mean, because it is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| I mean, it seems to be that we see more litter than we've ever seen before in all of our areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6148)|
| 1:42:36| And so that I'd like to address on, you know, how we're going to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| because I think it really starts way back in elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| educating the kids and making it a big deal to go out and pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| We used to have to go pick up litter on the playground and all, you know, when we were there in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| Because that's a part of being a good citizen and giving back, you know, when you grow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| Also, in terms of needing more people to volunteer, have you thought about going into the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| Because I know last year, with a lot of them getting their scholarship, they didn't have the volunteer hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| So, and we've used different things I've been involved in, different organizations from the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| or football teams or baseball teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| And that, I think, would be a good way to extend the education in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| So I just wondered if you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| So a couple of responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| One is the contract with Keep Knoxville Beautiful, it does prescribe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| And I believe the way the contract works is we use the exact criteria that's furnished by this litter grant of who we have to target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6218)|
| 1:43:50| And it divides it up like adults, elected officials, youth, businesses, institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6230)|
| 1:43:58| And so there are some target areas, and they are supposed to educate along all those different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6238)|
| 1:44:07| In terms of the schools, they do have some school programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| They go in, they have like a talking tree, and they have some different presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| They also participate at events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| And like, for instance, if you've ever been to one of the open streets, they might have a booth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| and they offer you a bag or a water bottle if you'll go pick up litter during the event and then return it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| And they do a pretty good job of doing events and having some programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| They have Great American Cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| And all of that effort, all those efforts are attributable to the educational portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6277)|
| 1:44:44| So if you looked at a lot of what Keep Knoxville Beautiful does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| it really is in line with specifically this funding source as well as their mission of beautification in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6287)|
| 1:44:55| And as far as preventing litter, I don't know, because we've had these Tennessee trash commercials for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6295)|
| 1:45:04| It's an enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| There's, you know, again, we take the angry phone calls at Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| I'm sure you all take angry calls or speak to constituents that are upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| And I try to always explain that we are not the ones that put it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| We're not the ones littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| We are a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| But actually, it's all of our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| It's a community problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| And it's actually, it's really sad that it even exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| I wish I knew the answer to solve the fact that people litter or allow waste to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6332)|
| 1:45:40| We provide seven awesome locations for you to legally dispose of your household waste and recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| And that's the only place, as far as I'm concerned, that you should be putting your waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| not allowing it to blow out of your truck, not throwing it out, not flicking your cigarette butts out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6351)|
| 1:45:59| So we are very passionate as a department about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| And I wish I had the mad, you know, new of a way to really stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| But part of that is enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| And we go after illegal dumpers when we can identify their names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| if there was something identifiable that we find along the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| But a tire, cigarette butt, the little things that you, there's no identifying marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6380)|
| 1:46:28| We cannot prosecute those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Even a police officer would have to witness it in order to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Well, and I learned many years ago from a highway state trooper up at Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| or Carter High School doing driver's ed, the only thing that's illegal is chicken feathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| You know, chicken feathers and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| Yes, and Ken Schwall did a segment on this several years ago that we go back to about litter and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6413)|
| 1:47:01| So if anybody's listening today or that they want to get involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| because you said there's three different groups, how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| do they just call Keep Knoxville Beautiful office to be able to sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| Well, so if you want to pick up along a road in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| we have a list of roads that we know are habitual problems and that are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| One other thing I know you had mentioned about young folks in the schools wanting to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| That's part of our selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| We may know of roads that are really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| You mentioned Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| It may not be the most suitable road for young folks to be picking up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| So if someone wants to get involved, they can call Knox County Solid Waste, 215-JUNK, 215-5865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| You can press zero to speak to a human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| We have a really good record of answering the phone, picking up during office hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| and returning your call if we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| So we can get you to what you need, to who you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| If your complaint is about a state road, we can get you to TDOT and you can complain to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| If it's something in the city, we can get you to 311 to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| And if you want to get active, we can help you get signed up to either do a one-off type cleanup event in your area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| or you can adopt a specific portion that we've identified that would be safe to clean up on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6495)|
| 1:48:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| The $50,700 that's going towards the litter education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| is that something that we could have handled in-house paying for staff for an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| as opposed to farming it out to where they're just paying for staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| I believe it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| I will say that this goes back, it predates me and our previous several directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| The state of Tennessee, if you were to go to the Tennessee Department of Transportation Litter Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| and Beautification Program, they definitely encourage all counties to partner with a Keep America Beautiful affiliate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6537)|
| 1:49:11| It's encouraged through our grant seminars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| Instead of giving them a direct grant, they're following it through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| I'll just say that Keep America Beautiful and the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| and the way this money is funded is from the beverage industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| It's basically a tax on the distribution of beverages sold in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6565)|
| 1:49:33| That's a very long partnership and I've never been one to question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| I've asked some people that operate the solid waste facilities in my district to run a little tab for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6581)|
| 1:49:51| For some reason it got squelched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| I wanted to know how many trucks, pickup trucks, whatever trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| comes into your facilities that doesn't have a tarp over it because we do have a tarp law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| For some reason I'm not getting the information back from those two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| I just wanted to know how many people are not following that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| And then the other issue is when those waste management trucks that pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| and deliver it to the landfill, are they secured properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| I went behind one truck that was not secured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| and it was just blowing out all over the place that came from one of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| What are we doing for those type issues that we're going to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| and take care of those problems that we can at least get our hands on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6638)|
| 1:50:45| Well, some of that enforcement, you know, that would be up to law enforcement on the private haulers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6645)|
| 1:50:53| if they're hauling to and from a landfill and they're not securing their loads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| That's not part of the solid waste department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| All I was asking for them was to see how many trucks do show up that are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| you know, does not have tarps on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| I just wanted that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| I'll try to explain the difficulty of that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| We have 45,000 vehicles come through on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| And most of these centers have one to two personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| They are watching four to five trash compactors, two bulky compactors and a recycling area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| and they are making sure that the folks are safe that are using that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| and making sure that things, you know, that people are putting the things where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| So not allowing paint, not allowing bulky items to be disposed of as bagged household trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6706)|
| 1:51:54| It's like organized chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| And for us to ask them to, in addition to what they're already doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| to keep a tabulation of how many trucks come in with and without tarps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| that would be a very difficult request to fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| I'm not asking for a precise number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| I'm just saying how many, you know, do you get 10, 12, 20 a day or something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| I don't want an exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| I'm just saying how many people are not following the law there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| And plus when they're leaving, when you're going to the landfill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| are we making sure that those trucks are really secured so we're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| Because I was behind one that was coming out of one of those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| and got on the interstate going toward Raccoon Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| and it was just flying out of the back of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| So if it was going to Raccoon Valley, I can guarantee you that's not our material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| because our stuff goes to a waste transfer station off of Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| I can tell you there are protocols for how they, when they back up to one of our containers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| there's a thing, they call it a diaper, where the ram has pushed all the waste in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| They do secure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| It is a mesh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| It's pretty tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| It's 2,000 pounds of pressure pushes all that waste in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| That is the industry way of securing those loads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| and our folks who haul the containers away do follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| Commissioner Busler, do you have other questions related to this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| I just want to know if they were just following regular protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| The motion is properly before us to approve the receipt of this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6822)|

| 1:54:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| Did procurement get with you to see if this is a potential piece of property in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| that we might have right-of-way needs from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| Yes, Mr. Ben Charble and procurement did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| We looked at our records and we can't really, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| determine any safety issue that exists now that would precipitate the need for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| to acquire the property in the future, at least at the current time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6895)|

| 1:55:08| This is a resolution that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| It's to amend IM's Meads Query lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| The motion that is before us is not numbered at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| Motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6923)|

| 1:55:27| The item is before us to amend the lease agreement, IM's Meads Query.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6927)|
| 1:55:37| The motion is for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| We will have the information from Parks and Rec this week to discuss at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| Again, the motion is no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6947)|

| 1:55:59| it's a resolution adopting a public records policy for Knox County, Tennessee, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6959)|
| 1:56:06| I move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| Mr. Law Director, I do not wish to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| but is this action that we're taking directed to us by state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6972)|
| 1:56:22| The legislature passed a law requiring every county to have a policy in effect by July the 1st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6982)|
| 1:56:29| and this is what you're voting on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Did I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| Seeing no further discussion, the motion before us is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=6999)|

| 1:56:49| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| We have one, yes, one last item that is added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7013)|

| 1:57:42| Madam Clerk, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Did I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| No recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| Motion is before us to move line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| No recommendation to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| We're going to pause for just a second because I think we're down to nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| but we're down to the discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| although the first thing that I had on the discussion items was discussion of upcoming budget issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7094)|
| 1:58:25| Is Honorable Mayor Burchett present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7105)|
| 1:58:32| Mayor Burchett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| I love him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| I just love him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| Were you deep in prayer over the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| I know your head was down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| No, I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| I would like to call out one of our directors who did a very good deed this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| Dwight VanDeVate had an employee that had a little motorcycle accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| and Dwight volunteered his house for a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| and I think we owe him a debt of gratitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| He kind of went above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7146)|
| 1:59:13| Don't get the big head, Dwight, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| I just want to give him a little accolade there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| What was your question, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| Yes, I believe you placed out public information today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| The presentation of the budget will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Yeah, May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| May 1st, here, 9 a.m., be there, be square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| Nothing fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| We're not going to provide you with a meal or anything, so just be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7174)|
| 1:59:40| Unless you want to do that, Mr. Chairman, out of your budget, you're more than welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| No meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Is there anything else you'd like to bring to us this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| That's it, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| As we then continue with the discussion of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| the budget will be presented by the Honorable Mayor Monday, May 1st, at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7199)|
| 2:00:07| We, County Commission, have to have a public hearing on that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| So I would propose that a couple of weeks would be sufficient time for members of Commission to study the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7213)|
| 2:00:21| and come up with your questions and be prepared to accept public comment for a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7221)|
| 2:00:32| And I propose Monday, May the 15th at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| At the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| How about after the work session to allow the public to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| The proposal that is before us to have two parts to this public hearing because I think that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7241)|
| 2:00:48| if we have questions of staff that they appear during normal business day working hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7248)|
| 2:01:03| the proposal that is before us to have a public hearing May the 15th at 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| I believe I'll change that to 3 for the purpose of discussion that we have our public meeting at 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7269)|
| 2:01:19| followed by a reopening of public hearing at 6 following the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7279)|
| 2:01:27| Now then, the floor is open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7287)|
| 2:01:36| I see no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| So without objection, we will have a public hearing on the proposed budget for Knox County Monday, May the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7298)|
| 2:01:51| at 3 p.m. and at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7311)|
| 2:02:06| It will be until people are exhausted or we have to call the work session in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7326)|
| 2:02:16| The work session will be at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7336)|
| 2:02:24| Commission office, please send out the appropriate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7344)|
| 2:02:34| What's the next discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| Discussion of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| Safe to assume that the vote would be at the May meeting on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7364)|
| 2:02:54| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| We'll add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| Yeah, please add the budget to the May agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you had brought to us a discussion of committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7392)|
| 2:03:19| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| This afternoon during the Knox County Audit Committee, we were reviewing the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| and it says that the members serving from the Knox County Commission serve a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| In our committee list, the only exception to that as we have it listed is the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7413)|
| 2:03:42| and for some reason we are taking the commissioner who is no longer elected and in August vacated or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7422)|
| 2:03:55| We're still filling the balance of that term, and I don't think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| I think it should be that when you elect when someone is a current commissioner on September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7440)|
| 2:04:07| and they're assigned to that committee that they serve the four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| They're not filling the balance of somebody else's term who's not a sitting Knox County commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| and that is the only thing in our committee list where we do that because, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| the Retirement and Pension Board, you're there for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| The Arena Use Committee, you're there for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| The Audit Committee, apparently now we're filling in whoever was the previous county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| whatever years they were serving, and that just doesn't seem right, and I'm not sure how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| I would imagine that it came with staggered terms when we went into the staggered terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| and I think that's something we probably haven't looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| but I think it would be wise if you're going to eliminate that or try to format that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7496)|
| 2:05:06| I think it would be wise to have some stagger in pension and in audit so that you have some experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| We do in pension, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| We do in pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| I think that's where that's coming from is that stagger where somebody that was on audit like Brown comes off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7515)|
| 2:05:22| because he's no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Right, because you're filling Brown's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| It could be a four-year deal that fills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| He should be a four-year deal on there that creates that stagger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| You should have been the staggered term, but you're filling, I don't know, you doing a four-year term for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| I have no idea what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| As far as membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| But in the new audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| The whole idea of the audit committee says that that commissioner serves a four-year term when he's not really serving a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| I was actually serving a six-year term on commission, but I believe the audit committee terms should have been four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7555)|
| 2:06:04| but I'm not even sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| Is this an item for discussion of full commission or does this need to go to our rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| It needs to go to your rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| The concern about the terms of membership of the audit committee is referred to the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7573)|
| 2:06:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| And it should, to me, it should just fall in the same as the arena use committee, the pension and retirement board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| It shouldn't be something where you're a carryover from a previous commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7593)|
| 2:06:42| Honorable Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| I just wanted to note that we've been graced with the presence of some new visitors back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7607)|
| 2:06:53| PAC 255 is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| If we could ask them to stand and recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| One more skate back here in the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7618)|
| 2:07:07| PAC number again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| 255.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| And the sponsoring organization is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7631)|
| 2:07:19| Colonial Heights United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| Thank you all for your attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7642)|
| 2:07:30| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| Yeah, these young men are here tonight to speak with me just a little bit later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| and they're going to be earning their arrow of light after this requirement, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| So it's an honor that they are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Why don't we just on this particular item get an opinion from the law director and bring it back to us next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7667)|
| 2:07:56| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| So we will carry this discussion item to full commission meeting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7684)|
| 2:08:17| Madam Clerk, what did we have as the next discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| A discussion on the sidewalks around the middle school at Pyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| Commissioner Bussler, I bring that because one of your constituents, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| has sent a broadcast e-mail to all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7712)|
| 2:08:40| Could you give us some background of what's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| or what should be expected out of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| Well, we have Cindy back here in public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| Would you like to come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| Dwight Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| Oh, Dwight's down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| Well, we'll have Dwight up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| We'll have not an expert, but we'll have Dwight speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| I'll gladly defer to Cindy, and she is the expert on safe routes to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| But since this was my neck of the woods, I thought I might be familiar with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| So the discussion, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| Well, the discussion, we've had public meetings out there about walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| in parental zones where kids can walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| And I think Cindy's been doing studies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| I think she's done it around the elementary and the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| So if you want to speak to what's going on so far out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7769)|
| 2:09:36| Okay, we had a study that was done for walkability around all of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| in unincorporated Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| And based on that study, we've got recommendations for where we should be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| at putting sidewalks as our primary location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| The study also has recommendations for potential greenway connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| and sidewalks that should be put in after the primary ones are put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| The schools in Powell, the elementary school and middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| came up high on the list of needs and the likelihood of students walking to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7809)|
| 2:10:15| So those projects, I want to say we had those in design last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| And the ones at the Powell Middle School are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| And they were built according to what was recommended in the actual study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| Right now, in the fall, we had a public meeting out at Powell Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| for the ones that were going to be built out at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7837)|
| 2:10:43| Basically, it was recommending about 1,000 feet of sidewalk on the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| and west sides of the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| At the public meeting, I would say it was a fair guess to say no one objected to anything we proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| for the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| But the west side, there were six homeowners along Wells Drive itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| And of those six, five objected to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| So we kind of put things on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| And since then, I want to say it was last Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| we had another meeting with the Enhanced Powell Group to take another look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| And we in engineering have been out and re-walked the property and we re-drove it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| and we looked at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| And from a constructability standpoint as well as the cost difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| the best location if we are going to build sidewalks for the Powell Elementary School on the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7899)|
| 2:11:46| is to locate them along Wells Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| At this point, that decision has not been made as to whether or not we'll actually do the project or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7909)|
| 2:12:00| I was there at the meeting and you really need the permission of the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7920)|
| 2:12:08| that are out that way to put the sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| My point was to some of the sidewalks, if we're going to use them, they should have a dual purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| also not only servicing the schools, which is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| but also servicing some of the businesses we have out there that we're trying to redevelop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| in the downtown Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| There's some situations we need to look at, too, before we put sidewalks out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| And I think our new superintendent, Mr. Thomas, as you're sitting back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7956)|
| 2:12:47| the issue is about what we're going to do with Powell Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7967)|
| 2:12:52| It's been there so long and we have so many portables out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| If we put a sidewalk out there, is that school going to be redesigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| or are we down the road in the not too distant future maybe building another school out that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7981)|
| 2:13:08| Because sidewalks are expensive to keep up also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=7993)|
| 2:13:20| You are correct, Commissioner, in terms of the overcrowded situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| In the capital plan, I think there's not a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| but it's identified, I think, as a Northwest-type solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| that would allow us to maybe do some work at Adrian Burnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| and to possibly build something that would alleviate some of the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| But right now, I don't think there's been anything identified that would close that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| But if we're going to follow these statutes about having the sidewalks for these schools to be accessed by walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8029)|
| 2:13:58| or what they call a walking school bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| has the school system even looked at some of the issues that we're going to have up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| We've talked about it, but we still haven't identified anything in the next few years that would provide a solution to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8050)|
| 2:14:18| So that's kind of where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| Let me get back to Cindy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| I appreciate you coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| As of right now, what we've talked to people out there, the ones that we need the permission to go ahead and do the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8069)|
| 2:14:36| we don't have those people kind of in agreement with us of what we're needing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| So right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| Right now, chances are we will build the sidewalks on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| and we'll move the money to another location because we've got lots of locations in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8092)|
| 2:14:59| and the parental responsibility zones that people are interested in having sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8099)|
| 2:15:06| So that's going to answer some of the questions of that mass issue that was sent out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8106)|
| 2:15:15| If a study has been performed and here is the expert, the school system, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8115)|
| 2:15:22| does look at transportation issues but maybe not at walkability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| If studies have been performed and we're going to move sidewalks to a lower-priority area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8127)|
| 2:15:36| we look like we'd be defeating the purpose of the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8136)|
| 2:15:45| I don't know if we can get condemnation on the property to build the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| Could we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| Without them coming out there and lynching me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| Construction easements and drainage easements would be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| But if they are not able to come to an equitable agreement, then, yes, it would move on to condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| I don't know that that is something that you'd want to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| That's not what I want to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| We are, Commissioner, rapidly getting to the point where if we're going to advance the discussion on the west side of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| we are going to have to internally decide if we believe it's merited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| And we, drawing guidance from the mayor, approach the use of eminent domain very, very cautiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8193)|
| 2:16:40| And I can't tell you candidly that I think this is a situation where it would get us across that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8200)|
| 2:16:47| If it did, then we would advance that discussion to the mayor next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| And if he were persuaded that it was the appropriate thing to do, then we'd bring it before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| Bluntly, I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| I think what Cindy's outlined is a very reasonable proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| I cannot say enough about the hours and hours and hours that she and Jim Snowden have spent out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| walking everybody through these routes and trying to get them to understand that every route has an implication for a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8228)|
| 2:17:15| Every route has cost implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Every route has utility implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| What we have on Wells Drive is far and away the best, most cost-effective and efficient alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| But if we can't get there, we can't get there, and we will need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| And I want to thank Cindy and Jim for all the work that they've done, and they've put a lot of hours on it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| I think speaking to the Wells, the route there, I think there's a couple of houses that it's within five to six feet of their residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8261)|
| 2:17:49| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| You know, I don't know the exact measurements, but they're very, very tight in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| And there is no question that the spacing is not what we would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| I will say in one case the affected property owner is concerned about spacing from a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| But at the end of the day, it is their property and it's their prerogative to offer their objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8285)|
| 2:18:11| And so, again, sidewalks going into the built environment are just tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8291)|
| 2:18:17| This is one reason we work hard, and I know this commission gets a lot of pushback from the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| and understand that as well, but when you construct a sidewalk in the built environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| it is exponentially harder than it is constructing a sidewalk when you have new road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8307)|
| 2:18:33| or a new subdivision going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| And that's one reason we tend to continue to be advocates for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| My next question is for Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Some of the discussion at the community meetings and on some message boards have been that Powell Elementary doesn't allow walkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8320)|
| 2:18:49| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| I'm not aware of that, but I know it's congested around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| I can imagine that the principal is looking out for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| But if we're going to pave it to walk kids to school, wouldn't we try to find a way to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8337)|
| 2:19:03| We'll be glad to look at that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| Seeing no further discussion, Madam Clerk, the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| Employee policy reporting to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| If you think back a few months ago, Knox County has gone through adoption of new employee policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8362)|
| 2:19:33| If we commission, we have a policy for the employees that report to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8373)|
| 2:19:49| What I would like to see us do now that we're sort of in a period of time that we've got the budget immediately facing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8389)|
| 2:19:58| but I would like to see us have a committee within commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8398)|
| 2:20:05| look at the employee policy and report back to commission whether we should follow county rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8405)|
| 2:20:16| or law director's rules or administration rules or whether we continue to have our own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8416)|
| 2:20:24| And the time that we can deal with that is in the month of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| But in the meantime, we need a little bit of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| And I see a lot of up and down over here, so I would like to, if it would be okay with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| I've got two committees now I'm working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| I would like to see Commissioners Gill, Carringer, and Nystrom read up on the employee policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8443)|
| 2:20:51| and give some conversation with your fellow commissioners sometime in the next three months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8451)|
| 2:21:03| Up to, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| I'll accept also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| I welcome the assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| Seeing no further lights upon the waters here, the next item for discussion is discretionary funds, discretionary spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8480)|
| 2:21:37| I know that other counties do different from what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| I know that there are different amounts or varying amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| I know that there are different processes for which constituent funds are administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8506)|
| 2:22:00| I would like to also have three other commissioners look at discretionary funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8520)|
| 2:22:08| And the three that I'd like to ask are those three that primarily wrestle with state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8528)|
| 2:22:15| and that being Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Bussler, and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| And sometime in the next three months or so come back to Commission speaking about how discretionary funding is handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8546)|
| 2:22:38| and have us a better understanding of what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| And you don't want to have a report back prior to us approving the budget for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Because that can easily be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| No, not for this year's budget for something considerations of later date for use ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8573)|
| 2:23:07| Now, you'll notice that I left out some commissioners because we're the senior ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8587)|
| 2:23:20| We might not know a new idea if it hit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8600)|
| 2:23:28| We have one more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| We got the issue from the Audit Committee related to the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| Yes, we have another added item of unnumbered the fraud, waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8619)|
| 2:23:46| and abuse hotline responsibility moving from risk management to the internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8626)|
| 2:23:55| per the recommendation of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| Any further discussion of that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| Did I hear a motion of no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| Or motion with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| Was it already added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| It was an add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8655)|

| 2:24:17| It was an add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| It was an add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| He wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Out of abundance of a caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| I would think that we would need to add that by three-quarter vote of commission to next Monday's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8663)|
| 2:24:30| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| I would ask for a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| Is that a part of my motion to approve an item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| We can add the item with three-quarter vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| All in favor of adding this item for Commissioner Anders' motion, which I second, to the agenda, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8687)|
| 2:24:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| That was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| This item to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| Make a motion to be moved without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8710)|
| 2:25:16| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8716)|

| 2:25:32| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8736)|

| 2:25:46| I'd like to bring before Commission two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| First, Thursday the 4th, 4 to 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| the John J. Duncan Senior Award for Senior Advocacy will be recognized at the pavilion at Hunter Valley Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8757)|
| 2:26:07| Also, I would like to recognize that the Development Corporation has secured a $500,000 grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8767)|
| 2:26:16| which will be used to add wastewater treatment in the East Bridge Industrial Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8776)|
| 2:26:25| and the Development Corporation will be there at the East Bridge Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8785)|

| 2:26:45| Commissioner Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| He doesn't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| Just a couple of quick announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8809)|

| 2:26:59| The five drivers we're honoring this month have done an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| They've been graded very highly and they'll be getting a $100 check from Ted Russell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| and also a certificate of appreciation from Super Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| He'll be there and be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8833)|

| 2:27:21| Yeah, 3101 Magnolia from 5 to 7 Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| Ms. Gill had better be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| We're going to have ribs, have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| Hot chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Yeah, hot chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| A lot of people will come by and hopefully say hello to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| And then also Friday morning, 7 a.m. at the Foundry, Knoxville Kiwanis Club is having their pancake breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8855)|
| 2:27:42| So it goes to their day camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| The funds go to their day camp and you can get a chance to come by 7 o'clock on Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8866)|
| 2:27:52| It's a good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8872)|
| 2:27:53| Have some pancakes and get a ticket from your Kiwanis Club member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| Yes, I wanted to just announce this Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Central United Methodist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8881)|
| 2:28:08| the 4th and Gill neighborhood and surrounding area, our property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| John Whitehead will be there to talk about the appraisers and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8893)|
| 2:28:19| So if anybody is welcome to come, it's in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| And then another thing is the women's suffrage monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| I was asked that next Monday, which will be our county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| is the last day to be able to donate to that or particularly with Mother's Day coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8916)|
| 2:28:45| that was to give the women the right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| And they are, for $100, you can do in memory, in honor of a brick to be put around up here on Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8928)|
| 2:28:59| with the monument up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| So I thought with Mother's Day it would be a nice gift you could do for daughters, moms, grandmothers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| or, you know, a special lady who's been very instrumental in your lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| and offer $100 to have their name engraved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| And we can have, I'll have some, we'll have them bring some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| I think we all got one maybe back before Christmas, an envelope that had all the information and the brochures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8964)|
| 2:29:33| Because I know our registrar, Dee Cherry Witt, has been helping working with me on this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8973)|
| 2:29:40| But I will get some brochures and have them up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| I just think that would be a good tribute for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| And since it's Tennessee, even more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| I'd like to announce that the Southville High School will be putting on Beauty and the Beast Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| So if you all want to go see one of my favorite cartoon movies, it's Beauty and the Beast at Southville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9001)|
| 2:30:09| Anything else to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9010)|

| 2:30:22| And I will give you one so that I can see what your two steps look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9022)|
| 2:30:28| Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| I think that's a challenge for some others across the room over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| The Hall, I cannot believe, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| Hall's Crossroads Women's League is having their outdoor classroom event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| That's a big, big event out there at Hall's High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| It's Thursday night, the 20th from 6 to 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| They have barbecue and all you can eat ice cream and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| It's a really great event for Hall's High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| And music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| Yes, and music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| And then the Lincoln Day dinner is also this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9059)|
| 2:31:07| Seeing no further discussion to come before commission at this time, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170417?start=9067)|
