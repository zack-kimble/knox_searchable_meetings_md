| 0:00:57| Commissioner Wright here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| Mr. DeFreeze. Mr. Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| here. Chris is the last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| Call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| We have fourteen members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| present. Five are absent. A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| few are on their way. Before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| we start, I want to say to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| fellow commissioners, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=84)|
| 0:01:24| a long task ahead of us. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| sure all of us know. I want us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| to be very precise in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| question answering. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| guess the word for the day is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| compromise. In politics, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| don't get everything we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| but we need to compromise with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| each other so we can get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| budget done hopefully today or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| hopefully today. So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| I want to turn it over to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| vice chair. Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| Colleagues, I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| asking the law department today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| to draw up language for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| referendum on a half cent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| increase in the sales tax. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| intend to bring that to you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Monday. My point in mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| that is this will have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| effect on this year's budget at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| all. So I'm sure that on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| it'll be discussed and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| even cussed. But as far as any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| discussion on it today, just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| reminder, this will not affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| this year's budget at all and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| we'll have ample opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| discuss it on Monday should you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| allow me to put it on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| for Monday or not the ballot but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| on the agenda for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| the fact that we've got several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| commissioners that are not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| yet, I think with one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| evidently will not be here at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| all today. We've got several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| that are, as you say, on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| way. The importance of what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| have before us, I really think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| we need to wait until some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| them show up before we proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Well, that's the reason I waited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| ten minutes to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| I understand. And I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| need to wait some more because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| think it's important to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| their input in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| No one won't be here until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| May I suggest another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| alternative and that is to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| about some procedural matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| For example, I think it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| be totally appropriate when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| get to the section dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| the approval of the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| county budget to go through one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| by one the various amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| that have been proposed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| various commissioners. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| that I've proposed some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Commissioner Hammond has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| proposed one, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Daniels and Davis have proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| I believe from what I hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Commissioner Pinkston has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| to propose. Why don't we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| them in the first the written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| ones that we received in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| and take those amendments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| preferably take the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| piecemeal, that is, each section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| that the person wants to do as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| separate vote when we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| that point. I think that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| be a reasonable way to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| because each idea should stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| on its own and not clump together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| in a package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| I just wanted to see if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| was consensus that that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| an appropriate way to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| when we get to the amendments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| the actual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Mr. Chairman, I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Commissioner Harmon that each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| amendment needs to have its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| say up or down vote, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| as we get into it, I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| will become apparent how it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| play out as far as every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| commissioner will have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| opportunity to offer amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| to the budget and then every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| commissioner will have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| to give reasons why they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| support or not support a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| particular amendment, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| as soon as we get into it, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| think it will start to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| how to proceed from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Mark, where are those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| amendments? I've read them, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| I've got so many books up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Well, if you want to find one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| convenient place, we have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| memo from John Troyer which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| analyzed the six he had in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Well, actually six different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| commissioners. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| you have that handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Well, I've got everything up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Yeah, I know. Let me see if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| can find my copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Quick question for the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| director. On Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Hammond's proposal, that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| take two-thirds votes, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| For the will tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| No, for his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| Let's talk about the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| What the law provides is by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| resolution of its county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| legislative body, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| governing body can approve of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| such increase up to 2.75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Right now we're at two and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| And that has to then be voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| This is according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| And that has to be then voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| on by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| And that's found at TCA 67-6705.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| It's subject to approval of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| So you can put it on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| by operation of this statute by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| simply passing a resolution of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| You know, I don't believe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| has been a charter issue, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| may be what Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| And I don't know that it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| be a charter issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| If this body wishes to put it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| the vote of the people, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| by simple majority vote on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| resolution have it placed on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| That's the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| I honestly think with this being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| such a regressive tax and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| penalizing the people that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| afford it the least, I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| body needs to do that with great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| And that is there a way for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| to become a two-thirds majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| vote and are done on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Because I think there will be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| outcry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| And to have that outcry come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| between now and we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| approve it on Monday, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| would be a travesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Well, you know, if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| the language in the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| itself, it says any county by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| resolution of its county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| And if you then look at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| charter, a resolution is passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| on one reading by a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| vote of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Takes two-thirds to add it if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| there's an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| In order to add this matter to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| the agenda for Monday, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| not unanimous, which many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| it is, but if it's not, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| It takes a two-thirds majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| vote to do that and to add it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| And that's by your own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| I guess the last soapbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| statement is that, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| have spent over the history a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| lot of times, a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| adding taxes that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| penalize the people that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| afford it the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| And I was just thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| This isn't done, you know, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Monday and then it's a done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| And if a strong block votes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| in, then it's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| it will be like the will tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| And we'll be talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| tax five, six, seven, ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| from now that every area voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| against it except one and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| So I would just hope that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| just really consider that before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| putting it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Well, we have 16 commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| One won't be here until a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| after nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| One won't be here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| And I'm not sure where Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Briggs is, but we have a phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| call in to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| So I'm going to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| I want to start with John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Since the mayor's budget was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| first, I wanted basically one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| thing for him to explain to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| He said, you know, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| to have a budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| So I wanted basically one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| for him to explain to each and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| every one of us about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Yeah, thank you, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| We have spent a great deal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| time in projections and putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| together a proposal that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| feel good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| I just want to say that first of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| all, we're going to beat budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| We're going to beat budget this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| We're going to beat budget this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| So let's start with the baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| because many of these discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| points about the budget have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| been about budget to budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| And I want to clarify and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| sure that everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| our property taxes, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| right off the bat, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| budgeted $788,000 a year on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| penny on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| We're already at $797,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| We've already beat budget this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| year on property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| And we still have a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| portion of June yet to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| and we've got July yet to count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| for our totals for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| And so when we say that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| gone up from $788,000, a penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| on the tax rate, to $814,000 a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| penny on the tax rate, our real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| increase is only going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| $797,000, where it is today, up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| to $814,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| And that's a much smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| And I feel and the numbers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| going up and we still have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| time yet for collections for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| So I feel very, very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| about our budget projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| You take them as a whole, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| 1.8% over last year and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Over this year's actual, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| going to be even less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| And so I'm here we are a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| later after the mayor proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| his budget and I feel very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| comfortable with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| We're going to make it and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| think that's an excellent way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| start this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| John, you should know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| shouldn't sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| This wheel tax was put in in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| 2004, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Parts of it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I mean, there was two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Well, I mean, the last part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| the $30 was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| It was projected in 2004 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| this would bring in $12 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| And it's never reached that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| point yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| It's never reached that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| It's never reached that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| This is a regressive tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Right now I'm with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| McKenzie even on the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| People out here working for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| living right now need relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| This gasoline is killing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| and we need to do anything we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Now I realize we need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| revenue but I feel like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| property tax increase, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| deduct that on their income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| If we're going to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| they can deduct that on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| If they owe on their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| normally it'll be paid for out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| of their escrow without bothering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| them so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| And there's things that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| do to help these people plus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| working class people that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| need a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| It's going to be cheaper for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| them than it would be paying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| That's going to put a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| more money back in the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| that they have to spend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| $36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| The sales tax is regressive and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| I think it hurts the people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| here right now that are crying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Okay, I want to just comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Commissioner Pinkston's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| From my perspective, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| concerned about a balanced budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| and if Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| wants to make a proposal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| change our revenue mix, say he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| wants less of the wheel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| more of the property tax and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| still fund the budget, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| I think that as many times as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| can, it's good to have as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| diversity in our revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| structure, but this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| commission decision and if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| commission were to choose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| trade revenues, then that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| entirely within the scope of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| commission's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| That's what I'm for doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Since we own the wheel tax, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| like to ask our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| since the people voted for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| wheel tax, how can we rescind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| The Tennessee Supreme Court has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| addressed this and there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| number of opinions from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Attorney General's Office, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| the State Attorney General's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Office related to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| But basically, the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Supreme Court has adopted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| position that you can, that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| legislative body can repeal a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| tax that has been approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| the populace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| And on the other hand, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| populace can disapprove of a tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| that's been approved by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| And you can flip-flop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| You can keep going back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| forth, you know, to the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| absurdity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| But just the mere fact that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| was voted on and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| through a referendum does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| take away this body's power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| under the state statute to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| repeal the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| Commissioner Luthell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| John, I'd asked you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| You're saying 814 is what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| penny brings in under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| current rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| And I'm glad you brought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| And if a new penny, so if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| were a tax increase, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| senior tax freeze, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| folks that have signed up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| it and been approved, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| taxes will not go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| So there is some loss there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| And also, you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| we're only going to collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| maybe 96% or so of the new tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| as you move forward as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| to the old tax where you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| still continuing in with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| penalty and interest that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| coming from past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| So there is some reduction in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| new penny that you receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| And how much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| I think based on the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| who have signed up so far on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| the senior tax freeze that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| net collections on the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| on the property tax, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| property tax would generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| $814,000 on existing tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| But because some people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| their taxes frozen if they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| signed up for the senior tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| freeze, then the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| number would be right at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| I'm just curious, Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| have you done a breakdown on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| what the maximizing the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| option would bring in versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| the wheel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| And before you got here, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| mentioned this will have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| impact on this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| And I was under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| that we would have to have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Our law director has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| really we only need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| So I will not be bringing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| forward on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| I agree with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| We need to have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| So I was just, it was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| So I'm not going to bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| But since it's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| have a bearing on this year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| budget, I just suggested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| we not have any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| because the voters would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| We don't know what they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I don't even know if this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| will approve it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| So with it hanging up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| air, I'm really not prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| to discuss it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| In the future, bring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| I'm a big supporter of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| fair tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| I think sales tax is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| the most fair taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| And I would be very open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| John Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| I'm going to be against the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| sales tax, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| But, John, here a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| ago when the county, I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| in politics at that time, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| voted the sales tax in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| I thought they had limited out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| to what the state would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| them to raise the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Well, what the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| provides is a fair tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| It's a fair tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1067)|

| 0:18:21| It's a fair tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Mr. Lambert, going back to the fair tax, you're supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| I think most people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| But the fair tax, I believe, eliminates all these other taxes, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| So, if we eliminate them, then I can go for the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| But as long as we have these other taxes, I can't vote for a sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| I'm for eliminating as many taxes as possible, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| So, Commissioner Abbott, Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Yeah, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I just wanted to let everybody know I was at a 9-1-1 board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| I'm here now and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| I want to take up Commissioner William Daniel's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| The new book that the finance department sent you, and a lot of you probably have a copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| it's on the first tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| You have the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| I turn it over to you, Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:59| Just a second, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| This is the first time I've had a chance to look at this, as all of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:26| Okay, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| One of the things I wanted to do when I came on commission was try to bring some fresh ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| and help people think outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| When I brought these to bear a couple weeks ago, it was also to help our employees think outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:49| We have an employee in county government right now, Roy Braden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| who I think exemplifies trying to find ways to cut costs at every corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| Sometimes he amazes me at how creative he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| I'm not saying that the ones that I have proposed are ones that we should necessarily do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| I think these are ideas that I think deserve some reflection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| but also to cause others to think outside the box instead of just accepting budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| and revenue projections as stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| There's several different grants that are development contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| The $40,000 that we were looking at that the commission was going to be giving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| I felt that would be something good to be giving back to the group that had actually spent the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| putting together the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| As you can see, the majority of mine go back to the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| The IBD, I felt like that $900,000, if there was a legal way for us to take that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:11| and allow the interest that we receive on the $12 million that the IDB has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| that if we could use that money in some other fashion, then that was $900,000 that's there for us to be able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| Also, the commission, we receive a discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| I felt like since there were so many charities that were left that had actually been approved for money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| but had no money to be given to them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| if we tell charities this year that next year you're not going to get money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| they can at least make concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| They can do the things they need to do to be able to fund themselves next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| But to come in this year and say, well, you're not going to have anything this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| I think puts a lot of our charities at help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| A lot of the people that Commissioner Pinkston has spoken about, it puts them in a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| So the things that I had asked for or threw out on the table would amount to $1.104 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:14| to be reappropriated as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Yes, I appreciate that, Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| But you've got down here the commission eliminate, there's completely, you know, in my suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:33| it was to cut it in half or eliminate all discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| If we eliminated all instead of the $114,000, it would be $154,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| So I think that I can go along with eliminating all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| That's what I think we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Well, that's what the $40,000 on the mayor's office was, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| This is just maybe a point of order or how to go about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| is that we're making amendments to a budget that we don't have yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And I was wondering if the order ought to be to accept a budget and then make amendments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| That's just a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| I mean, how can you make an amendment to something that we don't have yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| No, we're just doing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| We're not making, we're just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Oh, I thought this was under amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| I thought this was under amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| No, we're just discussing each commissioner's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| So we're not adding or taking or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| We're just talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Commissioner Dufault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Getting to Commissioner Briggs' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| I think a good way to proceed is to go ahead and see if we don't have a motion to put on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| and then we can discuss all the amendments as they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| And then we can, at that point, if commissioners think it's a good idea, they can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| Or if it's a bad idea, not support it and give whatever reasons for either side that they want to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| And then vote them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| And then we can make a vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| You want to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I'm ready to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Well, let me make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| You get ready to make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I think everybody out there would be happy with that, except for maybe the mayor and Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| But I guess we need to have it read into the record before I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| So if the clerk would read it into the record, I'm ready to make a motion on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1557)|
| 0:26:07| Is that number five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| If that's where people would like to start, they want to start with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| everything sort of dedicated off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| establishing a general county budget and making appropriations from the several funds for departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| institutions, offices, and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| and ending June 30, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| I will make a motion that we approve with a couple of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| One of the amendments I'd like to move is the elimination of the $254,000 for the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:12| I agree with Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| That's, you know, $254,000 for just a half a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| So we're talking over a half a million dollar budget once we get into this, and I think it's going to grow from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| So I would like to eliminate that and move one position for our internal auditor on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:41| It would be $50,000, but since we're in a tax freeze, or I mean not a tax freeze, but a hiring freeze, to make that $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| So that would be for the half-year salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:58| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| I've got a couple of things, just sort of, you know, I know commissioners here are going to have their ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| and are going to want to make amendments to that budget and like to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:20| And then as they come up, we can, as a body, decide if that's a good thing or not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| It might be that I can accept these amendments as a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| and we'll just move on if it's a consensus of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| or we can vote these individually as we go and add it to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| I think we need to vote on the amendments as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| A general consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| And just sort of a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I would like to say, and, of course, every commissioner can bring up whatever they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| but when we get to, I truly think we need to take care of the main part of the budget first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:09| and then work our way down to community grants, because if there's other cuts out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| then we may have money to move towards community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| And let's see where we're at after we go through the main part of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| to see if there's not some organizations out there that we could now help that we weren't able to get money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:37| through the citizen panels, because they ran out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| But if we can find some money, then maybe we can help some of them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Or maybe we can pay down our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Well, and I'm going to have something to address that later, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| but I wanted to get this out on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Or give it to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Yes, I appreciate very much Commissioner Luthell making that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| The reason I brought that up on the point of order is that I could see that if we look at these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| after we have a budget, we can discuss them and do the same thing that we were going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| but we have something to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| And I agree with what Commissioner Luthell said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| I think we should put the decisions on the grants to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| because we'll have a better idea about where we stand with funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| because some of those are very worthy organizations and charities that do need funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| But with the present budget, we just don't have those means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| I'd like to start off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| I'm willing to make a friendly amendment to Commissioner Luthell's motion and to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:46| First of all, I would like to say that I really appreciate the leadership that the Chairman of the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| Commissioner Pinkston, showed in coming up with what I think are some very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| creative ideas on what we can do with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I disagree with part of it, not because I have any knowledge that he doesn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| but simply we always can't agree on what the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| and what these revenue projections are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| Everyone has their own idea about where they're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| We have those that came from the county finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| We have those that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| And if we do the calculations, we come up with different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| But I think that the leadership that he showed on approaching this problem may be a very conservative means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| that we can go about approaching this in a very systematic manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| And I think he deserves a lot of gratitude for coming up with some original ideas on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| My amendment that I would like to make is a friendly amendment to the motion that's been brought forward on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| And I'm doing this in the sense that I think we need to be very conservative in these uncertain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| It appears that we're heading into a recession right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| and we really don't know where the revenues are going to be next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| And I think that what we don't want to do is to overestimate what they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and then run into a bind where we just don't have the money to cover it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| without dipping significantly into our general fund, our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:19| That's what we call the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| If we had to, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| But I think if we plan better, we may not have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| What I really would like to do is to cut the departments down to really a bare bone budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| take some of those funds out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| I spoke the other day at the finance committee meeting about having a commission budget contingency fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| where we would still keep the money in the budget and say we're not going to exceed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| but since none of us know what these revenues are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| we would have that money there if we needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| And even if we do make some mistakes and cut some of these budgets too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| they can come back to the commission and tell us why they need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| I think that serves several purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| One is that it provides accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| If they can't meet their budget, they come back and tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and there may be very good reasons why they're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Two, it should cut down a lot of these line item transfers that you see within the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| that when they're brought back to the commission as a stack an inch high is that, yes, it's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| but it's not very transparent where the money goes and the public and the commission knows where these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| How much would I like to cut the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Probably three or four percent, but I think that's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| What I am proposing as an amendment is that we leave the school budget for the present time where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| We leave the sheriff's department budget where that's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| That takes care of two of the most important functions that government does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| which is educate our children and provide public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| but then do a cross-the-board cut of two percent in all the departments that are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| What I would do is those funds that we save from those is that we can put into an undesignated fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| or what I've called previously a commission contingency fund where those departments can come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| And as we go along with these proceedings today is that we'll see amendments that people may want to put more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| into certain departments as we go through, or they may want to take other things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| But I think that that would be a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| Well, I just had a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:49| Our independent auditor, Mr. Walls, who does he report to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| You.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| He was created as a division of the legislative office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| And that, you know, I really don't have a problem with not funding the inspector general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| but I think we can get ourselves in the same situation with an independent auditor reporting to the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| and not being more autonomous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| I mean, it could be a point, and there's no disrespect to Mr. Walls, that with us being his boss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| I mean, in the future things could slant toward the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| And I think that that position needs to be more independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| That was why I liked the concept of an inspector general as opposed to an independent auditor that only reported to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:50| So I would be willing to go along with Commissioner Lutho's amendment if we could add some verbiage to say that he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:59| somehow reporting to, I mean, you know, kind of a two-headed deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| I think the office, the executive branch, needs to have, if we have a hook, you know, as with the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:14| if we have a hook into the independent auditor, I think the executive branch, regardless of who's in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| needs to have that hook so that there's a balance to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| Mr. Chairman, can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Mr. McKenzie, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| If for today we're having to deal with the budget and this is what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| and if you would like to bring forward, I don't know if it would need to be an ordinance or a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| to maybe alter the independent auditor somehow to give it more independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| I think that's something that we could probably take care of in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| Maybe even Monday or July or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| But if we vote that amendment in and we don't get resolution on that, then, you know, the points move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| And that's the only reason I'm bringing it up at this juncture because we are talking money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| I'm just not sure how to get that done today because that is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| because I would think it would take a resolution and we can't add anything to our agenda today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| since it's a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Is that, Mr. Law Director, is there a way that we could put some verbiage in his amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| to somehow implore this body to make that independent auditor a more autonomous position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2265)|
| 0:38:01| You'd have to look at the resolutions that are before you today and will it fit within any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:10| Right now we're on the budget resolution and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| That's really not germane to that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| I think that's for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| We can get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| But, you know, Mr. McKenzie, if you would like to bring that forward in the next month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Now, here's the thing to remember about the independent auditor, the internal auditor that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| That was an idea that came from a citizen's panel, which Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| who was not a commissioner at that time, it was a citizen's efficiency panel that came together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| and brought forth ideas and that was a great idea that they came up with that was implemented years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| And I don't know if Commissioner Hammond would want to speak on that, but that was a citizen's driven panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| and it was their idea that was adopted by the commission back several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| In fact, no commissioner sitting on that's here today voted to hire Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:26| He was hired by our previous commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| It's not necessary for us to go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| And we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| I would like to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| I think we're in danger of a couple things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| One is, if we're not careful, we're going to have sort of Christmas tree amendments where unrelated ideas are strung together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| Commissioner Luthold's idea for eliminating the inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| and having a slight increase in allocation, about $25K for an internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| is a separate notion from Commissioner Briggs' idea for a contingency fund funded by a cross-the-board 2% cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:09| They're both worthy of discussion, but they're also worthy of separate debates, separate proposing, seconding and voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| The other thing I want to say is we all come in here with our most important ideas to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| But believe me, in the course of our discussion, there will come opportunity for us to get them all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| We don't need to do them all right away or up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| So why don't we just take these one by one as has been suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Starting with the proposal on the floor, which I believe is just Commissioner Luthold's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| I had an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| He's already made an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Well, what I did is I made a motion, okay, on a resolution with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| So that's what's on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Commissioner Briggs has asked that his amendment be added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| And as of this time, I have not because I would need more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| And I'm not sure that going simply across the board with a certain percent is, although it sounds good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:17| I think you may have some consequences that may not be desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| I would prefer that I know exactly what is coming out of a particular budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| because some budgets may need to be cut a lot more than 2% or 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| And some may not need to be cut at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| And so I'd rather try to just hit those line items that need to be cut instead of just sort of across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:46| Now, whether or not we can have this sort of contingency fund, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| is that something that we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Or I think our charter states that we have to allocate the money for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| You're talking about the contingency fund that was suggested by Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| I'm not saying it's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I'm just saying, is it possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| A rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| I mean, isn't that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Can we set up a certain line item to where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| That's what the general fund is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| So, well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Where's the distinction then if it's money just being put into the general fund and not allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| or do we need to put it in a fund that has to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I don't know why we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| I mean, you have a general fund, which serves the same purpose, I think, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| that Commissioner Briggs is suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| I agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| We need to have that flexibility since I think there, at least in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| and I'm hearing a lot of other commissioners' mind, is we need to be very conservative because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| and although Mr. Troyer is comfortable with his projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| I get the feeling that many of the commissioners are not with the revenue coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| So, making sure that we have those funds available if partway through the year we may have to dip into them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| I think is a wise idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| We do have an amendment on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Anyone want to speak on the amendment, Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| Because we're going to take each amendment one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| Well, I don't think it's not an amendment because that's just part of my resolution as far as the Inspector General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:39| Are you through with yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Are you through with yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I'm through with mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| He moved to adopt with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| It's his motion to adopt with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| I told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| You got it behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| He had a friendly amendment, and I don't think he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Now you've got the whole dog in the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| You really started that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| Let's talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Right now you only have one matter before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| and that is Commissioner Lutho's motion as he has amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| He has made a motion, and he has made certain changes to the budget resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| Was that seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| That was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Then there was a question about Commissioner Briggs had asked for a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I assume that you do not accept the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| At this point, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| But it may be that as we go through that or if you come up with some other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| I just have a problem with, like I stated, just doing a sweeping across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| But I'm open to amendments and may accept them as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| If I don't and if this body wishes to vote on that amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| and if it passes with ten votes, we can add it to my resolution or my motion that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| You're talking about Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| If Commissioner Briggs wishes to make a motion to amend to put his concerns before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:46| then that is your motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| He can make a motion to amend and we would simply be voting on that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Right now, there's not been a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| There hadn't been a motion to accept the friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| A friendly amendment is at the discretion of the person who made the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| If Commissioner Leuthold said no, we can't force it on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| There needs to be a motion to amend with Commissioner Briggs' amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| not just a motion to accept the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Make a motion to amend Commissioner Briggs and we can vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| Commissioner Briggs still wants to have that on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| I would prefer to leave it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| I'll keep this just as brief as possible why I want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| I think you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| There are some departments that a two percent cut will be devastating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| There's others that they can live with it fairly easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| But what I want to do is to have the departments come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| and tell us why they need more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| It gets back to the whole principle of accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| which it seems that the public has been calling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| They want to know how their money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| And that was the basis of why I'd like to make that friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| I think that's a good idea, Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| I realize this is unfair to some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| but they have a chance to come up here and show us where we were wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| and we can allocate the money back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| Just so everybody understands it, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| There is a motion on the floor by Commissioner Luthold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| and it's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| And that's what is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| It is a motion to adopt a budget as stated by Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| If you do not amend that, then it ultimately will be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| and there's your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| And that's the end of that question for the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| and we'll move on to bonds and other matters and how to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| But just so everybody understands, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| So that would effectively wipe out all of the budget amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| that they're seeking to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| We better get them on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Mr. Law Director, can we take each amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Yeah, we can take each amendment one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| But we still have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| The motion to approve the budget as stated by Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| Now, any of you who wish to make amendments to that may so make them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| may so move to make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| But, Mr. Law Director, if we make those amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| and then we agree with Craig in accepting the budget with the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| if there's an amendment added that we don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| then we have to vote no on the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Ultimately, you're going to vote on the entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| So if you have any other item that you wish to take up before the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| related to this budget resolution, then you need to be making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| But would we have to vote on each one of those friendly amendments one at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| We're not voting on friendly amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| You're voting on amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Right now, there is only one motion that is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| I move that we add to the resolution, the budget resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:37| all the amendments that I have proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| all the amendments that Commissioner Daniels has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| all the amendments that Commissioner Davis has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| all the amendments that Commissioner Briggs has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| all the amendments that Commissioner Pinkston has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| all the amendments currently before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| and that those amendments be voted on one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| discussed and voted upon one at a time before a final vote occurs on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| That's what's going to occur anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| That's what this process will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| That wasn't what I understood the law director to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| The law director said if we voted on your amendment there and your motion, it was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| If we vote on what I have moved, then we are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| Right now, the floor is still open, and every commissioner can still make motions to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| and we can vote on those as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| I'm not calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| I'm allowing every commissioner to bring forth their amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| and allow this body to decide if they like that amendment or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| I just made a motion to bring forth all those amendments en masse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| Well, I mean, there's really no reason to make a motion to bring them forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| because the commissioners still have the right to bring them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| You still have the right to bring forward every single amendment that you wish to bring forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| But you don't need an amendment asking to bring them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| You already have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Well, if we want to go that route, then it's just a question of whose amendments go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| That will be at the discretion of the chairman, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Well, then I will just speak on behalf of my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| I would like to move forward, add to the six amendments that I have proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:32| Is that in this booklet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| It's also under the Troyer analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| and I handed out a separate sheet of it this morning in case you didn't receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| Our understanding now is that Commissioner Lutho has made a motion with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| Now, if any commissioner wants to make an amendment, is that correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Commissioner Lutho has made a motion that adopts a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| And we should somehow try to disassociate the word amendment from his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| You have a budget resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And what he has done, he has moved to approve the budget resolution, but he has done so with a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Now, that's your main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| You can have motions to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| You can add things to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| You can take them away by vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| But that's what you have before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Commissioner Harmon has made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| I don't know if that's been seconded, but he's made a motion to make a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| There is a six amendments that have been presented to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| You can do it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| or you could just take each one step, you know, item by item, step by step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| for the person who's proposed it, perhaps, and go through each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| I think his motion was to take each one line by line, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| My preference is that we take all the amendments that each of the commissioners have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| vote on them separately before we ever pass the final budget in whatever form it is after those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| At the end of the day, after everybody's had their say and their input as far as which amendments they'd like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| and if we vote them up or down and they're added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| then we have to then come back to the original motion and then vote the whole thing up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| Could we get a second to Commissioner Harmon's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| Are we taking them one at a time or is a block of six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| One at a time, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Is that what Commissioner Harmon wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Did you want to vote them separately or all at one block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| We're going to go through Commissioner Harmon's motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| You're going to vote on Commissioner Harmon's motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I think all of us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Well, I think he wanted each one voted on separately, so we need to know which item we're getting ready to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| Let me read the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| The first amendment, one, is to freeze sheriff department allocations at last year's levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| with KCSO making internal adjustments without overall increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| The savings of approximately $2.8 million added to the allocation for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| Where is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Does it sit right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| No, I think he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:18| For all of you that don't have it, it's on page four in the book that was passed out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:29| Mark, didn't you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:41| The accounting unit is 1006645, count 9940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| It's, in effect, a transfer of $2,739,243 by John Troyer's allocations, estimations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| This is just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| All of our conversations at this point need to only address this one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| One amendment, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| I'm just seeing this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| I'm sure we're going to be accused of being city commissioners, but I do support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:24| The reason that I support this is not city or what are the inside city limits of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| It's that if we look at where we are as a school system, if we had to give it a grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| you can give it whatever grade you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| but if you had to give the Sheriff's Department of Jail things grades, we're 98%, 99%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:46| We're spending a lot of good money, and they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| We're meeting optional goals, things that are not mandatory by their own rating agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3411)|
| 0:57:00| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| But, again, in times of recession, in times of economic downturn, I think we all need to belly up and make the hard cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:18| This is a hard cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I don't deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| This is a tough cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| But there are several unfulfilled positions within the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| I think we end up having the mayor's budget have like 30 additional vehicle purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| So, I strongly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| And our school system, whatever letter grade you want to give it, would have to be a little lower than what the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| So, I think this would also aid in balancing that process and balancing those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| A community puts money in what it values, and people see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| We have to value our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| We have to show that we're putting value in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| And I would hope that the school board would take this money, if this body chooses to agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| and put it into teacher salaries so that they can attract and retain competent and qualified teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| So, I think this is a good amendment, and I implore each of you all to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Sheriff Jones, could you come speak to this amendment, please, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| and let us know how this would affect the department and the safety of our citizens, if it would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| Well, I guess we'll get the party started early today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Three words I have for that, that's total insanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| Total insanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| We had to transfer a million dollars last year from salaries just to cover our operational budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| If you want to cut law enforcement in Knox County, then that's what you need to do if you follow this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| I'm not going to vote in favor of Commissioner Harmon's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| even though I agree with you on the schools and everything that's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| I do believe that public safety is something that we also need to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| But I didn't get a chance to speak on Commissioner Leuthold's inspector general before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| I'd just like to make a brief comment that I support taking that out of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| The citizens are going to have an opportunity to vote on this in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| The petition initiative is getting underway probably in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| So the citizens will vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| And once they vote on it, then we'll know whether we need to fund it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| But I'm in total support of taking that money out and using it for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Sheriff Jones, I can't support that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| I've called for a 2% cut straight across the board, even in his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| But it is with the contingent budget that he has where you can come up here and plead your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| And that's the way I think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| If you've got a legitimate need for that money, we'll give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| We've never had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Any time we've done line item transfers, any time we've ever asked for extra money, we've come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| If you want to put what we're asking for in a contingency budget on our food and on our gas that we know the prices have increased astronomically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:28| because of our fuel prices, we're glad to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| We come up here, Alice and I come up here every meeting and ask for every transfer that we think we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| We show you where we spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| We're very diligent and we're fiscally sound with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| But to say that a 2% cut, I can tell you that a 2% cut would cripple us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| But to come up here and say that to keep it from last year, it's nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Well, the 2% cut I'm talking about, people are talking about the library, sheriff's department, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| You can come up here and plead your case and we're going to give it to you if you've got a legitimate cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| But I just thought we need to hit everybody across the board on the 2% that each department come up and plead their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:11| And I'm all for school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| We're going to get the U.S., Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| We're all for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| We feel like any amount of money that you can put in education greatly benefits us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| and helps keep people out of our detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| We're all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Hard times makes hard people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| I just want to agree with I think most people on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Sheriff, I can't support Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| But if you look at Knoxville Police Department budget versus sheriff's office, it's about $8 million difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| And we talked about it a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| They have half the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| They have more than half the territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| They have no jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| And I think the sheriff's department does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| I will not sit here as a commissioner and jeopardize public safety in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| I know the former sheriff had worked 15 or 20 years making our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| I know Sheriff Jones is doing that now to continue to make our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| And we don't have too many violent crimes in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| And it's because the officers are in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| It's because they're watching our businesses at night, watching our homes during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| I support our schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| I think schools and law enforcement, and as I've said a couple of weeks ago, roads are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| So I hope during this budget we keep those three things intact and add some to our paving of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:39| Now we're speaking on Commissioner Harmon's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| Yeah, this is a pretty emotional subject for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| Law enforcement protection is extremely important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| There's not a more beautiful sight than those blue lights when you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| I've had a gun put to my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And after the suspect fleed, I called the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| And it was just a few minutes that those beautiful cars showed up with those flashing blue lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:17| I couldn't sleep that night because I found out that there had been a murder in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| And I was afraid that maybe the young man that pulled the gun on me might have been that murderer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:31| And that turned out to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| And I couldn't sleep that night until I got a call from a sheriff's deputy saying, Mr. Lambert, you can sleep safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:40| We have the suspect in custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| So it's in that spirit that I want to ask these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| And I know I'm asking geography questions, but I hope you know the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| How big is Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| The last count, I think it's over 500 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| Over 500 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| How big is the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| I think it encompasses about, I don't know, 183 square miles maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| So less than half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Less than half the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| How many Knoxville City police officers are there that provide that law enforcement protection within the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| I think they have approximately 400 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| You're asking me some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| I just want general answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| How many officers do we have in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| We have over 1,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| But how many of those are actually street-level officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Certified officers are probably somewhere around 450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| We only have 50 more officers to cover more than twice the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3883)|
| 1:04:51| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| That's the point that I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| And that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| And I know I get pretty angry over this issue because it's personal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| But that's the point I want to make is that my citizens deserve law enforcement protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| And the commissioners that come from the city that have 400 officers that are patrolling less than half of the area of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| asking to limit my law enforcement protection for my citizens, that makes me mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| Crime is on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| And I want the people of the 6th District to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| And I am not for any cuts in the Sheriff's Department at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Just very quickly, Sheriff Jones, is that my proposal for the 2%, just to make it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| was to preserve the schools and preserve the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| I agree with everything that Commissioner Harmon and Commissioner McKenzie said about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| We need to find all the money we can for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| But I don't think taking it from one of the two most important functions that county government does, we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| And I'm going to be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| We need to get to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Let us remind ourselves of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| and the fact that we have before us the only fee office that is asking for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| The others came back with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| The most beautiful sight to me are kids graduating and going on to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| And one of my schools in my district, Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| a study recently found only 9% of the graduates six years ago achieved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| We need to give to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| And we just ask ourselves, where are our priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Our words with our schools are fine, but our deeds have to reflect our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| The fact is that you look back four or five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| the Sheriff's budget was about 8 cents on the tax dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| and now it's working itself up to 11 or 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| And that three or four penny drop corresponds with a three or four penny drop for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| We're robbing one to pay the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| It's a short-term, long-term bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| All we're asking this fee office to do is to do what the other fee offices have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| which is come in at or under last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| Mr. Harmon, I completely agree with you about education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| and I don't think that we need to be underfunding either law enforcement or the education department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| We need to look for cuts elsewhere instead of only choosing those departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| Sheriff Jones, what I'm concerned about that you had mentioned is food costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| which will increase for the jails, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| And your fuel costs, which will absolutely increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| And so if we diminish your budget, you will not be able to patrol as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| And I believe that part of your responsibility is prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| And just having a presence out on the streets prevents a lot of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| And I think that we need to make sure that we are protecting our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| And so I am not in favor of this, and I appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| And my promise to you, as long as I'm sheriff, is we will be fiscally sound with our money and taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:13| You don't have to worry about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| Our books are open a hundred times a year if you wish to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| We spend money wisely and sensibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| And our goal is to make sure that everyone in Knox County is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| As long as I'm sheriff, we'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Commissioner Davis brought up something I wanted to ask John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| I received a phone call last night from Mr. Bill Phillips, who is a new member of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| Apparently, he came before the school board with regards to fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| saying that if we are purchasing fuel outside of our own facility, we should not be paying tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| If that's the case, and we are paying tax now, particularly with our patrol cars, any of our county vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| can we address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Because you're looking at several cents that could be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| So this doesn't speak directly to his motion other than the fuel, but I wanted to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| And that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Glad you asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| If you pay for it through the service center, that's tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| The county has, through a pilot card program, if you use a pilot card, then that is also tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| So the sheriff's department had the option to fill up at the service center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| or to use the pilot cards, and they're both tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Commissioner Lutho, then we do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Just real quickly, I agree we need to fund the schools more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| but I don't think we can afford to do it on the back of the sheriff and the deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| Sheriff, I know you're going to try to save money where you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| And if at all possible, if you can save us some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| and then turn it over back to us in excess fees next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| do I have your pledge to try to save money where you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| and try to think of ways, new, inventive, cost-cutting ways that you can save money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| You have my pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| I think we've done that over the past 16 or 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| As long as I've been involved with administrative and coming up here, we've tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| We will continue to do that, and we always have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| That is our pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| You can raise your right hand and say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Want me to repeat after you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| We have a motion on the floor, Commissioner Harmon's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| I know we need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4233)|

| 1:11:27| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Might as well continue with mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Amendment number two of mine actually came up at the committee meetings and will be our Monday agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| so for the sake of time, I will skip that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Which one is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Negotiate the contract regarding the hotel-motel tax at 40 percent rather than 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| Do you want to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I would like to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Negotiate the contract regarding the hotel-motel tax at 40 percent rather than 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| Do you want to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| I think we should because I think we do need to kind of discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| The allocation part about grants, maybe we just need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| In effect, this is to negotiate the current pending contract regarding the hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| which is currently at 45 percent to the Tourism and Sports Corporation to the state minimum of 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| The resulting savings will be evenly split among 18 tourist groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| There were 15 when I sent it to John, so the numbers are a little off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| but I think they're going to get about $15,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| I can list them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4346)|

| 1:12:52| My idea here was rather simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| These groups are part of the reason tourists enjoy their stays, part of the reasons people come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Their ability to promote themselves will only dovetail with the work of the Tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| and Sports Corporation to get people to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| If we work them back to the state minimum of 40% of reimbursement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| they'll still do a great job at Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| We had before us yesterday an employee of that Sports Corporation earning $191,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| and didn't have the imagination to figure out what to do other than cut marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| which to me was totally bizarre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| If you're paid that much, you should have enough imagination to figure out how to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| So I hope we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| I think it's a reasonable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| We can leave the citizen group allocations where they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| but take these tourism and visitor-related groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| and get them this allocation simply through changing this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| A lot of these are already getting community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Is this in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| This would be in addition to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Actually, I just want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Yes, some of them are and some of them aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Commissioner Harmon, can I ask, because some of mine, we were on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| Yes, we had a very similar wavelength there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| But one of my concerns was that with regard to the opera company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| I was not wanting to give money in addition to what they had already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| I wanted that to be just their bottom line because I wanted to also include the Kumba Festival as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| That was not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| But because last year the opera company got $10,000 and the Rossini Festival that I attended was fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| And if we did what they're currently funded is $71,563, and then you were wanting to add, what, $19,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:40| So they would be getting close to the $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| That would be a 900% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| So I would accept as a friendly amendment to drop the opera and add Kumba?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| We're going to take the community grants at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Yes, but to my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| Your motion on the floor is, and I don't see it anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| What were you reading from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| I'm reading from both the handout I presented as well as from the proposed budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:09| Now, it's absolutely true this deals with community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| So if you want to put this one at the end, I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Community grants are at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Then why don't we move on to my amendment number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| which actually dovetails with something Commissioner Daniels spoke of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| eliminating funding of the development corporation, saving $900,000, and adding that allocation to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Your motion now is the amendment two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| Well, at your suggestion, I'd move that to the end when we talk about grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| And I'm going to move down to my amendment three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| which is eliminate funding of the development corporation, saving $900,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| and adding that allocation to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| What we probably need to do is take amendment two and take amendment 2A and then put the grant part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| It's the 40% versus 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Oh, it's all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| So we need to go to amendment three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| We'll do that at the end, and I'll do the one I just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Amendment three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Are there any questions to that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Yes, and I appreciate them wanting to save dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| but what I'm concerned about is especially in economic downtimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| you need to make sure that you are funding jobs and creation of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| And so I think this is an important function of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| I don't want to see these dollars eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Mike Edwards, I think I saw you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4608)|
| 1:17:01| Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| You got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| I've been studying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| He's been saying a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Todd can go over what goes with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| Up until 1991, the development corporation was, prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| a department inside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| It is a government function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| It was taken outside the county proper because of how economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| works in transactions between recruits to buy land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4659)|
| 1:17:47| and what your all's requirement would be in process versus what the world does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| You have to be able to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| The development corporation has two spheres of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| One is the capital dollars that you all have given us that was restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| in your resolution to develop industrial parts, whether it's Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:15| whether it's Midway, whether it is maintaining existing detention ponds or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| You also fund, since 1991, an operating budget that allows us to manage all of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:35| to manage the operations and manage the and administer the county industrial development board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:45| which is a significant operation in and of itself, and to do the work of the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:56| It is the annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| I'm not sure that bond counsel is going to not go nuts if you use 25-year-old bond money to go do an annual operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:12| In fact, I say I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| I know they're going to go nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| But if you just remove funding of any county agency or department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:28| and pretend it's not going to have obvious results, it's just nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| It is an error to look at the development corporation as something that is not part of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:44| That's why you have commissioners serving on the development corporation, the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| It is your operation, and you're basically saying we want to goose that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| I'm at Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| You'll continually get us confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I must get a haircut, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| It's the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| It's the beard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| It's the beard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| I didn't think we were going to get personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| Mike, the interest that comes in off of the $10 million, $12 million that's currently in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| can that money be used for operating expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| It's not my understanding it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| I think bond proceeds and that would be called arbitrage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| and I think they've ruled that you can't do arbitrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| It used to be you'd go out and you would float a bond for $100 million and live off the interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| and they kind of went, the IRS kind of went nuts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| Because, remember now, you're using tax-free debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| I wanted to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Law director, is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| In a nutshell, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| So if this board does not fund, at least at some level, the IDB, then it would go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| It would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| This is development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| I mean the development corporation would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| Here is what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:40| If you were to take it down to zero, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| One of the things that's in that budget is $300,000 that is used for workforce training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:56| And Todd was telling me a while ago, over the years that's trained 4,700 workers, and here's how it's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:05| If a company is getting ready to expand or if they're getting ready to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| and retool their equipment, that is at risk to lose those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| Because those companies then are going through a recapitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| If we can give them a $25,000 grant so that their employees can be trained on the new equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| that not only provides skills to that employee to carry with them throughout their life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| but it makes it a lot easier to keep that company here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| That is a unique thing that Knox County has in a state that has very restrictive incentive constitutionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:51| that gives us some sort of edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| But in order to make it through that year, we could not use that money for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4975)|
| 1:23:06| That takes us down some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| And then, you know, we'd have to just sort of figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| My problem is, y'all, this money is not going to be there next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:20| It's not like you're going to say we're in a tough budget year and everybody needs to tighten their belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:28| I mean, tightening their belt is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| This is the neutral option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| But the thing is, it's not going to be there again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| I don't know how you replace it in future budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| So one way to remove the arbitrage problem, excuse me, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| One way to remove the so-called arbitrage problem is simply for this body to vote to take the money, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| currently planned for an unneeded industrial park over a sinkhole and put it back into your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| Could we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Could we vote to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| I think what, without implying that I in any way agree with your characterization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:22| I think that the way the development corp is structured, that if you want it to go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:31| then it would require an action on this body and the development corp's body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| and then the assets, including the land, would revert back to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| whether it is the existing industrial parks or Midway or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:52| Let's just talk Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| I mean, if we were to say stop Midway and shift the money back toward your operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| that would be a significant savings in budget, couldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| Midway was capital dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| And meaning you can't recoup them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| Yeah, but they're still sourced through capital dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| We bought Midway with money from bond proceeds that you or the commission gave us for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5120)|
| 1:25:30| So it's still sourced through bond proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| But we could, for example, change our minds, sell off the bonds, recoup the money, right, pay off the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| And return it to you because unless you want us to go find other land instead of Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:49| No, I think the problem is and the reason this comes up is the development corporation has this habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| I mean, we have a Tommy Shumpert Park where a business park didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Now we have this one that's very controversial in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| I think we keep coming back with things that don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| So our suggestion is maybe we should be doing less of this and saving taxpayers money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| whether it comes out of the capital pocket or another pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| as long as we start shifting it around to bring it back where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| Commissioner, I will say with as much passion as I possibly can, and I'm not one to, you cannot put jobs in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:25| One of the things that I really fear this year, we may actually have a net loss in jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| We're in a recession and we're in a contraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:41| We cannot go off the air in recruiting jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| And we're still at Rhonda has got about six very good prospects right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| And there's a lot of folks that have no prospects or no prospects of getting prospects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| We're still in a pretty good position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| If Chattanooga is lucky enough, lucky for them and lucky for us to get Volkswagen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:05| we have a great opportunity to capitalize on that as does the corridor between Chattanooga and Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| and Chattanooga and Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| If we don't have product, we're going to forego those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| And to think that that is insignificant to Knoxvillians, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| I don't know how you're going to operate any budget if people don't have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| Again, it's not about jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| It's about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| It's about the discretionary use of money within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| I think in this one, you have persuaded me that there are some things worth saving, such as job training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| So, I'm going to amend my proposal that we simply cut the Development Corporation allocation in half to $450,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| the savings going to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Who's going to administer this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Do we have a second to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Do we need a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| Who said yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| The law director says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| We don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Do we have a second to his amendment to cut them in half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| What you have is a string of provisions to an amendment that we're taking separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| Now he wishes to change one of the strings, and it needs to be seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| This is the way we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| It failed for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| We need to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| I just want to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| I just want to remind everybody that you have cut your budget $160,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| and if we completely eliminate your budget, who's going to be recruiting jobs for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Well, it's two sides of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| The real deal is who is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| who's going to provide product for these companies who are coming here that need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| they're either going to come here or they're going to go to Greenville, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| You've got to have that if you're going to be in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| And for a long time, you know, we really weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| Now we are, and we can see a great deal of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| You don't want to stop this now, particularly when you see this type of shrinkage in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| We have a motion on the floor to eliminate funding of development corporation by $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=5354)|

| 1:41:54| One passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Sixteen, though, and one passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Mr. Chairman, for amendment six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Again, amendment six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Change the terms of the Deputy Pension so that the employee contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| employer contributions, benefits and rules match those of the tenancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| consolidated retirement system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| and begin negotiations to roll the Deputy Pension Fund into the TCRS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| The reasoning is obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| This thing was something we could not afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| It's creating all sorts of debt and borrowing problems for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| Going to a smaller but established fund such as TCRS, I think, makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| I think this is a pension board matter, but I'm going to let our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| Not only that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| I mean, it was approved and it's in our charter, so you can't change that by budget resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| Well, with that, I will move my amendment, too, down to the grants area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| and let others begin reading their amendments if they're so inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| Next amendment will be Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:10| Just a quick question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| Does our charter allow us to do this or require us to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| Allow us to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Deputy pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| We're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| It was put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| But was the motion to allow us or to mandate us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| I'm not sure where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| It was simply to allow the commission to establish such a fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| This was approved by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| It was a change in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| You know the route to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| It's not through the budget resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| I'll look in the wording that you won't look up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Commissioner Daniels' amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| The first one deals with accounting unit number 1005130, account number 9950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6234)|
| 1:44:04| Decreasing that budget item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| It was 50,000, reducing it by the 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| What I'd like to say on these is that we would move them possibly to the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| and we can discuss it later in the budgets if we transfer that to budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| or if we transfer it to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| If that's permissible, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| What was this 50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| Eden, does everyone know where he is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| No, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| Look in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| Page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| He's on page one, but I think he's at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Are you starting with the bottom line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| You said 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| 50,000 is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| Everyone has a new book at the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| Which one are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| Everyone looking at this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| It's the second item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| We're not doing this grant thing first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Is everyone with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| With it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| But the 50, I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| The 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Economic and community development contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| That was, I believe that was actually the amount of money, John, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| Yes, the mayor's budget proposal included $50,000 that was unassigned for the commission to assign a purpose for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:28| So that's already, what you're asking is already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Well, I'm asking for it to be moved from the control of the commission actually either back to the general fund to be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:39| grants by the committee since they had, there was, there was a list, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| of grant hopefuls that wasn't able to get it, even though they were approved for certain amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| that this would actually either move to them or we can put it in the general fund and actually transfer it to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| Is it not already in the general fund, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| Yeah, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| It's just it hasn't been assigned a grant or other purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| Isn't this the 50,000 that we always at this particular time used to move to certain grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| I mean, isn't that what we've done in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| The mayor's intent was to provide a backstop in case there was a grant that wasn't funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| that the commission felt should have been funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| There's $50,000 here to do just that or to fund several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| That's what we've always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Wait, William, we can get back to this 50,000 when we start talking about grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| Yeah, and that's all I'm saying is that if you all want to vote on this now, that we either move it to the grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:42| and let the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| I think we need to move it to the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| And actually, the next line item is the mayor's office on the lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:55| We had 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| There's 40,000 in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| I would like to change that from 40 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| I agree that we do need one lobbyist that, you know, is representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:10| All the other counties have people representing them in Nashville, and I think we need that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| How much money is in the lobbyists right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| It's $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| And I think the line item that Commissioner Daniels is speaking of is the $40,000 that's in the mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| for discretionary, which I would correlate with the commissioner's $114,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:40| So the mayor's discretionary fund was reduced from 50 to 40 this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| So this contract with others is not the lobbyists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| So this is to take away his 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| Yeah, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Is it 40 or is it 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| I didn't understand what the motion is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| I was thinking this was the lobbyists because it had contracts with others written on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| This is a, like all of you, this is the first time I've seen this broken down in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| And I'm trying to follow it based upon what's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| So are you saying you want to cut it all the way up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| I'd like to reduce that by $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| Down another 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| So you want to reduce the mayor's discretionary fund from 40 to 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| What's this used for, John, this line item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| This is the, where the mayor would go to a charity event and buy a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:56| This is, the mayor has used this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| and I think he's ready to address this for Beaumont Elementary for a sign at $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:06| What we've done in the past is last year, for example, we had an opportunity as the year got underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| Beaumont Elementary needed $12,000 to match other monies for a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| We used the $12,000 to implement a program at Beaumont Elementary School, working with commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| and the school board members in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| We had a situation come up at one of our schools where they started a soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| They were going to be the only soccer team in the school system not to have uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| We spent several thousand dollars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| We had signs that were torn up at several schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| We went and replaced those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| We funded it, helped fund fill house operations when we've had leaks and different things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| We've had boiler problems in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| So this gives us an opportunity as the year wears on to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| So we reduced it by $10,000 already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| And obviously the decision is yours how you'd like to reduce the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| We tried to use it for things that make good sense over the course of the year that you can't budget for originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| because you don't know what's going to be coming up or what options you might have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| If these things are worthy, could we not put that money into the contingency fund that Commissioner Briggs want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:18| and you could come back and say we've got boiler problems at Gresham Middle School or Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| or we need to fix the field house so we're more transparent instead of just doing things as a kind of just day-to-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:31| operation, let the citizens know exactly where we're fixing problems and what we're doing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| That's a good question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| We are going to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| We're going to give you a report every month when we come to you so that you can see where we're spending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| Sometimes you don't have the opportunity to come back and debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| I know when we had the opportunity at Beaumont, they had to know whether we had the additional money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| And to be quite candid, we went out and raised $24,000 in private sector money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| We just needed the last 12 to match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| That's where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| The situation with uniforms comes up at the last minute with some, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| American children who I felt like needed uniforms to have a soccer team when other schools had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| So I'm going to give you a report on how it's spent for and you can look at it and scrutinize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| But I think what you'll see is that we're going to try and do some very good things in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| and I'm not going to waste any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| I'm not done, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| You know, if you talk about uniforms and stuff, I mean, how could that come up at a last minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| I mean, surely it's a practice to get ready to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| They have to know they didn't have uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| And if we bring it to the forefront of a commission meeting, we may have business people stand up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| you know, I put their name on the back of their uniform and I'll pay for their uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| So I think it's just a more transparent way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| And, you know, we've got into trouble last year with people saying we need to be more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| And I just support Commissioner Daniels doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| I think we should put the whole $40,000 in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| And if you need something, you come back and just ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| So that's what I'd like to see done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| So is that an amendment to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| You finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Is there a friendly amendment to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| Well, it's up to you for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Yeah, I'd just like to make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| And I appreciate everything that Commissioner Moore said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| When we met at the finance committee meeting the other day, we, just as the mayor just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| we said that the mayor would come back and let us know what the discretionary spending was for just out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| you know, the sense of accountability and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| I think that what we are, I really agree with what the mayor says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| There are things that do come up that the mayor needs to respond to where he doesn't have to wait a few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| or a month to come before the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| And he is the chief executive of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| And I think at some point we do have to leave him the discretion of using the funds appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| With this resolution, I guess it was that we passed on Monday when the finance committee met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:14| is that he will have to come back and tell us what the money was spent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| And just as we did with the $20,000 expense account is that we'll have control, not control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| but we'll know what that's spent for also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| But I do think he needs the flexibility to be able to respond when someone comes to his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:33| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| I think what Commissioner Briggs talked about, we were talking about corridor reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| The mayor said he's going to be giving us monthly reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| I don't think it's going to happen, but let's say he spends it on something that we find objectable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| I guess we could through our monthly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| Budgets are amended throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| If we wanted to, after we see something that we don't like that he's done with this fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| we could take the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| And I guess that's our accountability that we have over these funds is to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:23| if we see a trend that we don't like, we can always come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| Mr. Mayor, we don't like what you're doing with it, and we're going to pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| And we can put it in the general fund or somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| So it is a reduction from 50 down to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| And, you know, I think the mayor will do a good job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| I'd just like to remind the commission he's got an additional $20,000 that he can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| and it's a different part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| So you're talking about $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| I don't think there's no way in heck that $60,000 is going to come up in one month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| that he has to just automatically start writing checks and buying football uniforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| and feeding kids and doing whatever in one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| So I think having a $40,000 put away where he comes and asks us, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| we may be able to make that 40 come into 80 because community business people may say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| if kids need uniforms, I think there's people in this community that will step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| And I know there's been a lot of people in the community that has already stepped up to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| buy uniform kids in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| So I think just to say we've got $40,000 out there because last year we see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:35| We approved something that said auto allowance, and it turned into three different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| And then it comes back and, well, you all approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| You should have known what was in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| So I think in abundance of caution that this money be kept away, and he still has $20,000 to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:53| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| Is it half now or is it still four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| Yes, sir, $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=6959)|

| 1:57:26| 11, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| I don't think we need to vote more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| Well, I don't think we need to take up your $900,000 again, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| I think that it was sufficiently handled earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| He didn't even vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| Commission discretionary money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| This obviously is discretionary money that is given to each county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:54| My suggestion is that we take that money and either, again, move it to grants or give it to the schools in light of the budget difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7074)|
| 1:58:05| I think this would be a responsive move by the commissioners to, you know, we want everyone else to cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| and I think this would be a good step forward for us to say that we're willing to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| Well, I think we use that as grant money, at least I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| And these are the people that I use my money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| They get $250,000, $500,000, $250,000, which they can't come to county commission and get $5,000,000, $6,000,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| and they're happy to get their little $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Well, I guess along those same lines, and, you know, I'm fairly new to this body, and this might be a question for Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:43| For the most part, has this money been going to nonprofits and local organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| and entities that are nonprofit in nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| So it's kind of like Commissioner Strickland said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| It's a lower level funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| I know in the few months that I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| I have been able to bless a few people, organizations, with some funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:09| I think it's just a lower level extension of what we do for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:17| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| I think we need to keep this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| It's an opportunity for us to give $250 for maybe a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| Even like the mayor says, for uniforms and things, it's important that the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| low-income area has to have some kind of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| You know, I agree with what Commissioner Daniels said, and I sort of agree with what the others have said also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| I'm allowed to amend this or not, but I wonder if in the sense of sacrifice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| like we're asking all the other departments and the mayor and everyone else to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| cut it in half rather than $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| I think if he's cut it to $3,000, if he would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| I think someone has an amendment to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| I think Paul has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| But it also included the mayors too, cutting everybody's in half, county commission and the mayors in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:15| That would have been a savings of $77,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| I think that if that was not there in the line item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| then you wouldn't be inviting people to dip near the bowl to drink out of the same cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| I just feel like if you allow room, people will come up to drink out of the tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| Commissioner Browntree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| Yeah, Commissioner Daniels, I was fortunate that I had some discretionary funds left over from the person I replaced here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| And I did send those towards the educational arm of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| And the PTAs that I gave $500 to were tickled to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| I don't know if they would have gotten any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| And they all appreciated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| I heard from every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| And also, as a matter of public safety, I also assisted the Carnes Volunteer Fire Department with their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7262)|
| 2:01:10| So this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| And I know Commissioner Harmon, Ivan Harmon, and Commissioner Lambert have, I know for a fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| they've used some of their funds to help some of the schools buy sporting uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| And the kids wouldn't have been able to do that without their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| I'm for cutting it in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| I think that these people that are asking this money need to suffer just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| I really feel that we need to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| And I know it's hard to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| But if we don't have it, all you have to do is say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| And I think it should at least be cut in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| We have a motion on the floor to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| I'm sorry, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| You know, Commissioners, if we want to think outside the box, why don't we lead the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| Let's just do away with our salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| We make between, if you take our travel and everything, that's over $437,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| It's community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| That's the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| And give each commissioner $10,000 of work worth, that would be $190,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| I'll make that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| We've got another item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Let's do this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| What did he say anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| If someone would pay my legal fees, that might be a good trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:39| Commissioner Smith, I didn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| I was talking to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| What I was trying to say, Mr. Chairman, you know, is I look at myself as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| I look at myself as a public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| I'm not in it for the money, you know, what I can get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| You know, we make between $19,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| You take your travel into it, some $23,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| That's $437,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| And I'm not saying this to brag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| I give my salary back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| That's what I'm in it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| Plus, I give my $6,000 away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| So, the 7th District gets a little bit more than its fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| You know, if we want to think outside the box, and I don't want to put the other commissioners on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| but, you know, guys, I'm for not even having a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| It's public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| That would free up $437,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| And if you want to take it one step further, you could even then increase it from $6,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| and give each commissioner $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| We can give it to our schools and people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| You know, I feel like I'm in it for the right reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080618specialpart1?start=7410)|
