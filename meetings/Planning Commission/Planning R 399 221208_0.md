| 0:12:20| Applicant is requesting closure of this section of South 21st Street due to safety concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| since it is the owner on either side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=745)|

| 0:14:33| Location between the southeast corner of parcel 094EG013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| and its terminus in the southeast corner of parcel 094EG0201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| Applicant's reason for closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| The alley provides access and egress to the private property of signatories attached with this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| For public safety and the protection of property, we all feel it's in the public's interest to close the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Approve the alley closure of Java Alley, a 10-foot alley off South Central Street between the A4CED parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| from Central Street to the alley's western terminus subject to any required easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| since it is not needed for access and staff has received no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Seeing no opposition, Mr. Clark, if you'd state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| John Clark, 2207 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=942)|
| 0:15:52| Happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| I just wanted to ask some questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| I was curious what the reasoning beyond what's in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| and then also I know that there are some parts of that alley are publicly accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| and I was curious if that's going to remain publicly accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| and then also if there's access needs around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| So some of that may be staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| But I was thinking about, like, emergency, like, egress from adjacent buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| The first part of your question is the alley will not remain open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| There are emergency egress points for about 117 residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| and our management problem has been from all the signatories on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| that we have a homeless population problem that are actually camping out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| and blocking the egresses to the emergency egress doors for our stairwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| And multiple times over the last several years we have removed debris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| and people who are blocking the egresses from our buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| which is a serious life safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| So that's the primary reason for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| What about the city of Java has some seating out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| That portion of it, is it going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| The owner of the building that is the landlord for Java is in agreement with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| and we're going to manage that independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| The access point, control point for the alley closure will be beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| what's currently the seating patio portion of the Java restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| I'd heard some of those questions from others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| and I just wanted to get those out on the record and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Yeah, that's a dead end alley right now, and nothing good happens back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| I'll make a motion to approve the closure of Java Alley per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| We've got a motion for right-of-way closure per staff recommendation from Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1102)|

| 0:18:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1109)|

| 0:18:32| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Moving on to item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| The applicant is house-to-home renovation and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| Right-of-way to be closed, Boggs Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1123)|

| 0:18:53| The road was never improved or completed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Upon inquiries to the Knoxville Engineering and Knoxville Planning Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| we were informed there are no plans to further develop the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| Closure of this road would help enhance the two adjacent lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and make Zero Boggs Avenue a buildable city lot, which would further add to the city tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| The staff recommendation is to approve closure of a portion of Boggs Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| that runs between Ashley Street to Sam Houston Street, subject to any required easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| and because staff has received no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1171)|
| 0:19:43| I'm Beverly Linkus, and I'm an owner at House-to-Home Renovation and Construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| and our address is 154 Cary-Reagan Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| We're requesting that that, I guess it's kind of an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| It's really nothing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| It's just overgrown and grassy, and we talked to all of the property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| and everybody is agreeable and sees it as a positive just to really maintain that property better as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Any questions from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| We've had a couple right-of-ways this year, requests for closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| and if you look on the map for this one, you've got part of the road built out to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| and then you've got, what, three blocks there where it is not, and this one is right in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| And when we've talked about other right-of-way closures, we've thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| well, let's not close a right-of-way in the middle because then that definitely precludes the development of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| you know, the other, you know, that one on the left because it just doesn't connect to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| So I don't think it quite makes sense to close this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| Additionally, you know, the right-of-way is not just for roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| The city could utilize this for, you know, sidewalk or a greenway to provide some more neighborhood connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| Additionally, the right-of-way is potentially wide enough to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| like the city could request to close and replant these as lots for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| put them into the homemaker program and increase housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| I mean, the adjacent property owners would love to get a free piece of property from the city right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| but I think it could be utilized as an independent lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| and therefore I'm going to make the motion to deny this right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| We've got a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| And seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| We've got a motion by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| Seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| And I see we still have some discussion here, so we'll go with Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| My question was going to be somewhat by that, but my question needs an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| If we close this, does that become two lots, and who owns them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Split between the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Ms. Albertson, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| It's my understanding that either side of the right-of-way gets deeded over to the existing property owners on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1337)|
| 0:22:27| So it really wouldn't become two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| It would become split between four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Right now we're discussing among the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| I don't have many thoughts about how it, if closed, could be divvied up, whether between owners or as two individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1368)|
| 0:23:02| But one thing I will say is I'm very intimately familiar with this area, with these blocks right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1382)|
| 0:23:11| And I'll preface, I own property over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| I do not foresee any financial or any other gain from this, but I am very familiar with the topography and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1397)|
| 0:23:26| And so in terms of the question of closure or not, I do think that there's not a feasible use of this land for the city as a road, as any use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1406)|
| 0:23:42| I think it does, it will better serve the city as private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| And connecting Boggs, the drops to, you can see actually right there where, what part of Boggs does exist, actually to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1427)|
| 0:23:58| That drop right there is very, very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| And then on the other side, the topography is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| So I'll very much support and think that this is a good move to close this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| And if anyone has any other thoughts on whether it should be split up different ways, I don't right now have any thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| But I did want to ask, because when that was mentioned, you wanted to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Was there something else that you wanted to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Actually, it was what you were speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| So yeah, exactly what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Thank you, Chairman Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| My initial thought was to approve closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| But after Commissioner Schelso's comments, I guess my question to staff is, could that be developed into two separate lots or even one lot for buildable purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1485)|
| 0:25:01| So I will say that we checked in with the city of Knoxville about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| And I would defer to their engineering department related to what these lots could be used for or what this area could be used for if it's not right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1506)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| I don't know if this is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| So I think Commissioner Higgins brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| The topography out here would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| With the current road standards of today, it would really not be possible to build a road here that would meet the safety criteria of a modern-day street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1537)|
| 0:25:46| So the city would really not have any plans to develop a roadway here because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| You can see the topography either east or west of this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| And even within this section here, it's very challenging and would be very difficult to tie in to the other roads that are in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1555)|
| 0:26:04| Some of the other questions regarding ownership of the lots after closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| A little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Some of the issue with the lot ownership after closure I think goes back to, and I'm not a surveyor or an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1574)|
| 0:26:24| Some of those folks here could probably speak better to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| But it has to do with who owns the fee title of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| And so a lot of right-of-ways were dedicated from private properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| And so when those cease to exist as public right-of-ways, they typically go back to those private properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| Some of that has to be researched out in the deeds and that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| But unless the city purchased the property and it's part of the city right-of-way, when they close it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| it reverts back to essentially the original owners in the chain of title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1613)|
| 0:27:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| I was going to say other uses would be difficult for the same reason, the topography, the idea of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| If you were to deviate from an existing roadway, you're under the ADAG standards for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| And so they would have to be very flat with multiple landings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| and it would be very difficult to construct anything within this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| And the same goes for greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| The city tries to make sure that the greenways that they build are also ADA compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| and it would not be necessarily possible to build one here in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| I just want to add a comment to Commissioner Schoelzel's thing about other uses, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| is that we have had discussions with the city and are initiating a broader distribution of these right-of-way closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| so other departments will have a chance to look at the opportunities for any reuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| such as community development, housing, KCDC, Parks and Recreation Act, senior level management at the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| So we can potentially take advantage or the city can potentially take advantage of any infill housing opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| or other things of that perhaps have slipped by us in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Chairman Hill, based on engineering's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| I would recommend that we approve the closure of a portion of Boggs Avenue per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| So we've got, you know, we're still going to vote on this one, and then we'll hang on to yours to see if we use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1712)|
| 0:28:41| We still have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| A question about what Director Welch said in conjunction with what engineering said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| If the research hasn't been done yet about how those were originally acquired by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| then there's a chance that the property you were saying would be available for infill, but we don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| No, we don't know that for this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| but I think going forward that that is the type of activity that needs to be done to see if there are opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| for other uses besides a road or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1753)|
| 0:29:22| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| So if we close it, right now the ownership doesn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| We really don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Does it go on to the tax rolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Yeah, that's where the title search would have to occur to see how it was originally acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and that based on comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| So we don't know if it goes back on the tax rolls, if somebody pays taxes on it or not, if this happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| I would assume it would go back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| It's just whether it's four or two or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1797)|

| 0:30:04| Commissioner Schell, so any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Yeah, I mean it's wide enough to be an independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| You could have two lots, which would definitely add more to the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| than giving a quarter to each adjacent lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| The incremental value that goes up to those properties is not going to be as much as two independent lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| and two separate homes potentially in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| So, you know, yeah, maybe a road can't be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Maybe a greenway can't be built, but I think some homes could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| And I don't think we should close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=1835)|

| 0:37:53| Thank you for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| So we have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Mr. Bolton, would you like to proceed or would you like to defer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| I'm going to defer and speak at the end if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2288)|
| 0:38:22| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I'd like to speak specifically about the sector plan amendment request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| When this sector plan was adopted, you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| and this was pointed out in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| it's surrounded by a sea of the agricultural land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| And this was a deliberate decision as part of updating the sector plan in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| 2015 to make that entire area agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| I know that the difference between ag and rural residential is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| slight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| but it does get to the integrity and the reasoning behind changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| In this case, there is a deliberate decision for that to all remain ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| And as we're going through advanced NOCs right now and looking at broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| things, this one kind of looks like it could be a spot sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| In this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| staff's recommendation of planned residential at one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| can actually be accomplished under the existing ag sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| In the Northeast NOCs, in the land use classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| you can approve PR in the ag land use if PR and it's clustered in one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| which is exactly what staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| So in the interest of giving a dependable, repeatable, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| sector plan process and upholding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| I'd ask you to deny the sector plan and then approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We have more opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Dr. Nancy Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Hi, Nancy Scott. I live at 6653 Ridgeview Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| directly across the street from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| I would not consider myself a resistor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| but I consider myself rather uninformed and I have concerns about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| information I was given. It doesn't seem to match what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| The information shared with the local neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| what is going to be more than one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| I'm assuming that means home per acre, which does not match what we all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| We all have at least an acre. That was my first concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| My second concern is in regards to traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| We live on a two lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| The sheriff's department has to get called because of the speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| The part of where this road is is the flattest part of the Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| People go over 50 miles an hour. My neighbors had seven dogs ran over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| I personally have had animals killed because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And so my main concern is what it's going to do to our traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| Ms. Albertson, I think we had a little discussion at agenda review on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| Would you like to comment regarding the rural residential versus ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| So the rural residential, as Mr. Murphy stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| there isn't a huge difference in this sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| particularly between the densities that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| One dwelling unit per acre could be recommended under the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| designation or the rural residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| The rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| I would say typically talks about how their rural areas that may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| moderate to steep slopes and that that would be a reason for why we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| want to see clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| And I would say this area has pretty steep slopes on particularly the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| side of Ridgefield road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| So for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| staff was supportive of the rural residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you for your comments. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| I'm asking for the essentially the same thing that Chairman Hill asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| just in direct comparison to what Mr. Murphy spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| because I very much appreciate his comments about not wanting to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| sector plans if we can avoid doing that and maintain their integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| So it sounded like he was saying that you could cluster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| you could get the PR one dwelling unit per acre and cluster that without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| making that sector plan. Help me. Commissioner Adams, if you will forgive me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| I've gone out of order here. I've not let the applicant speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| So do you mind holding for just a moment and I'll get right back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Okay. My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| I'd like to bring to the commission's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| I have a supporting neighbor that would like to speak and is signed up to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| so if this is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| And I can make some comments related to the previous two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| And then I'd like to reserve it again to also address the commission if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| I don't see any additional person signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2590)|
| 0:43:19| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Unless there's no objection here, please proceed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2601)|
| 0:43:31| Mark Sinclair, 6710 Ridgeview Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| Based on your picture up there, if you see that cutout section at the upper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| corner of the property, that's my property and bordered off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| two sides from the properties in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| Based on where that land is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| there's really not a huge drop off in the back there that was a concern with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| one of the individuals up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I actually am okay with him doing the cluster in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| I think we can maintain the rural setting of the area by making it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| available to a few more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| One single dwelling per acre, I think, is very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| With respect to the young lady, I do know traffic can be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| but I think that's something that, as a resident there, I can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| So I think it's a good option for us to create more rural-like homes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Mr. Bolden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Well, let me begin by saying I followed the planning department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2687)|
| 0:44:57| notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I sent 10 direct invitations to my immediate neighbors and gave them both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| zonings, highlighted the differences so they would be informed, and invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| them to participate and contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| I received no contacts directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| I have learned this morning there were four recorded responses that, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| opinion, are negative, although they appear as if somewhat supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| Basically, my request for two units per acre, I feel, is very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2730)|
| 0:45:40| And the reason is, if you look a half mile either way on Ridgeview Road from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| Jones Road to High Springs, you'll see the majority of the property owners are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| clustered very close to Ridgeview, and over 50 percent of their properties are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| undeveloped because of either the steep terrain or their choice not to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| As opposed to my property, which we've had since 1984 and operated as a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| farm and property, it lays extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| The difference in elevation from Ridgeview to the back of the property is 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| It's a 4 percent slope, not 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| There is a pond there at the center that has been a normal agricultural pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| developed by previous owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| It's a natural drainage way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| My intent is to improve that and make it actually a positive design feature in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| the development and plans that would be submitted at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Today's meeting is just to acquire the appropriate zoning, and I can answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| additional questions if you'd like to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Let's go back to Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I think I set out my questions for Liz to help me understand, based upon what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2821)|
| 0:47:12| Mr. Murphy was contributing, why we have to make the sector plan if we can do PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| one dwelling unit and still have clustering and not change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| So I would say the conditions of this area, if there was a larger amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| this area or more comprehensive look at this area, a lot of the lots, some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| them are closer to an acre in size, so you could potentially consider this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| as rural residential more than just agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| But the applicant has asked for rural residential, and I don't see a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2870)|
| 0:48:03| concern with one dwelling unit per acre at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| But if you choose not to amend the sector plan, that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| I think you could still get approval for one dwelling unit per acre under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| agricultural designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| If you read the specifics of the land use classification table, it calls out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| how rural residential is really for areas that are accommodating these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| residential uses in agricultural areas more so than, say, agricultural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| But there's not a huge difference in terms of density allowed between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2918)|
| 0:48:52| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you. Just a clarification from Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| In agricultural, the minimum lot size is one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Okay. So the difference here, we can get nine units on nine units that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| clustered in a much smaller space, or we can have nine units or nine lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| throughout the property on one-acre tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| It's going to be more to have an impact on the visual and rural aspect of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| There's also a 100-foot lot width requirement in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| So it would be subject to meeting those dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| So I think if the plan is to protect the area and not develop the entire piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| of property, really what's being requested with the plan amendment and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| one dwelling unit per acre I think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| I'll make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to a rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| hillside protection per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| We have a motion to approve the sector plan per staff recommendation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| And we still have lights to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| My question, I'm seeing a lot of dwelling units on these other acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| And I understand the intent to change it to rural residential so it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| But it looks to me like there's dwelling units already that don't have an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| land with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Could staff maybe talk to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| So I will say that there are often acreages across the county that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| agricultural zone that may be on properties less than an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| And they probably predate when the zoning ordinance was changed to allow an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| So I would imagine they were platted sometime before that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| So previously the agricultural zone, I think back in the 1950s, allowed lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| of agricultural lots of about a half acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| And I was the one that asked Tuesday why they would want to even go to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| rural if they can get one lot per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| I understand that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| But I really don't see a problem with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| But I'll probably support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| You know, Commissioner Roth, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I mean, a half acre lot is still a pretty big lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| And, you know, there's a precedent around it for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| We even have a neighbor here that's supporting it that directly would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| So I got to tell you, I think I would support two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| We're not talking about one acre, half acre lots if we go PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| It can be what's the minimum size in a PR list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| There is no minimum lot size in PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| So you can do a better job of clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| So, you know, to say it's going to be a half acre lot, that's kind of erroneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| More than likely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| We're just looking at basically talking about density at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| But let's get the sector plan and then we'll move on to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion and a second to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3165)|

| 0:52:49| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Chair will entertain a motion on the zoning for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve PR plan residential zoning up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| one dwelling unit per acre for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| We've got a motion to approve plan residential for staff recommendation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| That motion was made by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| We've got how many no's do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Can I see the no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| We've got four no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Ms. Karen, do you have those identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| So give me that count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3215)|

| 0:54:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Agenda item 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3252)|

| 0:54:41| Staff recommendation, we've got two motions on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| First motion would be, staff recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| because it is not consistent with the location criteria and is within a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| The second motion on the rezoning is deny the neighborhood commercial zone because it is not consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3299)|

| 0:55:35| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| The Gibbs Planning Advocates, their leadership asked me to speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| They were unable to make today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| And they asked to support the denial of the request for neighborhood commercial here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| A couple of reasons that were in their comments they submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| First, that's a curve that's typically traveled at pretty high speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| So if there's a lot of in and out traffic going into an establishment there, that's going to be potentially challenging from a traffic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| And two, it does go back to speak to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| This is, you know, this is, again, sea of agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| And this is, you know, trying to look at neighborhood commercial here would be the start of establishing a commercial node,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| which we really think is appropriate to wait until we finish the advanced Knox process and see if that identifies this area for that kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3382)|
| 0:56:31| It's really easy if you start to land commercial in the middle of residential or ag to then land and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| And you have some large parcels nearby, which could potentially be requesting, you know, that could incite interest to be really large commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| So we think that's a conversation that needs to happen at a community level instead of an individual parcel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| That piece of property, there's commercial property down almost to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| If you look on there, it's commercial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| I think there might be one or two little properties between there and the commercial property and the commercial property across the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| So there's really, I mean, that's, I don't see no reason why that can't be commercial down to that section of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3437)|
| 0:57:26| because, like I say, there's one or maybe two little pieces of property between there and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3446)|
| 0:57:37| Are you done with your comments, Mr. Cantrell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| I would just like to hear the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| I understand that you were saying that you're basing this off of other commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| Are there any other back story or thoughts that you want to give us about what the hope or intention here is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3474)|
| 0:58:05| Well, that piece of property I acquired years ago, and it's broke up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| Church owns 80-something acres across the highway that I let them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| And the Atkins Road property, I broke it up into two to five acre lots that houses are being built on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3494)|
| 0:58:24| And this particular piece of property don't really tie into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| And it's really more suitable for the highway and for commercial than it is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| You know, that's the only reason I'm asking for that because I don't see any future in putting residential on that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3516)|
| 0:58:45| Or I would have put one on it with the rest of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| It just didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Given the fact that we've got substantial commercial property already zoned to the south, I guess west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3535)|
| 0:59:08| I think the staff's recommendation is spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| And I would recommend that or make a motion to deny the sector plan amendment per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3553)|
| 0:59:22| And the entire purpose of neighborhood commercial is to provide commercial more rural areas where there's not currently commercial property available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| And we do have sufficient commercial property to accommodate the neighborhood if there's a demand there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3571)|
| 0:59:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| We have a motion to deny on the sector plan by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| This was kind of interesting to me, and really before I was sitting here looking at it and thinking about commercial property next to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3593)|
| 1:00:01| I was ready to vote to deny it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| And I'm not saying I'm still going to deny it, but one of the things, one of the thoughts that crossed my mind with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| when we say it doesn't make sense because it's agriculture, it's in a sea of agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| Most of Knox County at one time or another was zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| I live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Things are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Things are moving out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| People are moving out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| And I think, quite frankly, there is a demand in the rural areas for neighborhood commercial type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| We're going to see where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| You can't walk anywhere from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| But Chaud Road is coming through the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Five years from now, I will guarantee you this commission will hear tons of rezoning issues that are in agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| that they want to have neighborhood commercial located along that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| So I don't think simply because it's in a sea of agricultural is a reason not to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3659)|
| 1:01:08| But at the same time, I don't disagree with Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| There is some commercial property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| And would it make sense to do it on this corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Maybe at some point it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| I want to agree with Commissioner Roth with those comments because, you know, I don't have a strong opinion either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3683)|
| 1:01:34| But it does, to the applicant's point, there's not a lot of viable economic uses for a property like this in a curve for housing or for farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3694)|
| 1:01:50| And it doesn't seem like farmland is as viable nowadays and definitely for a parcel that small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| And then you're left with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| And, you know, the more housing we have, the more that we need commercial and accessible commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3720)|
| 1:02:09| And there's a lot of new housing going up on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| And being in the curve, I don't think a lot of as many residents would want to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| So I kind of, I don't have a super strong opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| But I do, I am curious about the potential use of property like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| And I think I would support a commercial here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| But just kind of echoing Commissioner Roth's thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Thank you, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I'm on the Commissioner Roth bandwagon too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| I love neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| And I think it's extremely convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| It provides a better tax base, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| And when you talk about the potential uses of this property, it just seems like it would be a good fit for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| So I could support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| I have to concur, especially with Commissioner Higgins, in that we do have to have discernment to look for highest and best use of a particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3789)|
| 1:03:19| And considering that you've owned all of this property around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| And I believe if the highest and best use was for residential, that's what the owner would do for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| Or to donate or to whatever would be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| So I do think it is a rough curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| And so for that reason, I'll be voting no against the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Yeah, I guess I'm curious why the site couldn't be used for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| I mean, you're butting up a creek, which would be a nice amenity for most homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| I guess I'm having trouble looking at it and seeing what's the negative for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| Well, are you familiar with that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Well, when you go through there, most people that I've talked to, and I have talked because I've had the other houses sold and built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3845)|
| 1:04:15| nobody's interested in that for that use because of the way it's located on that highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| You know, I think if we want to encourage more urban sprawl, we rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Because then we'll be looking at rezoning everything between that and the commercial to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| So, I mean, if that's what we want to do, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| But then you're going to have, it's going to be difficult to deny any rezoning requests or properties between this tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| and the ones that are already currently zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| I think comment one, I don't see how commercial around a curve is safer than residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| because you have more people than trying to turn into property and maybe multiple cut points to get into a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| So I don't think a curve for this body makes a lot of sense to make it commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| The second point is that, and this is why it's so important, that a lot of the consideration that was just being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3917)|
| 1:05:26| was, well, just down the way we've got commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| And some people are saying, well, there's enough commercial, and so we don't need to put it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| Other people are saying, well, because it's there, we can spread it on along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| And that idea of, well, just look around, and if there's something there, we can kind of hook into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| and make that the plausible reason, I think really requires a finer look than just justifying it because, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3945)|
| 1:05:57| there's commercial down the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| So that's why I support Commissioner Phillips' motion to deny and staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3958)|
| 1:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Yeah, I agree with the staff's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| I think, you know, just because someone doesn't want to build a house on it when you're maybe trying to sell it for too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| doesn't mean it can't have a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| You know, the highest and best use would be self-storage in a lot of properties to get the most bang for your buck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| in a lot of parts of the county and city, and that's why we don't allow self-storage everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| So zoning is there to help protect and build the communities we want, and I support the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| Ms. Albertson, are you able to identify any categories that warrant a second plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4004)|
| 1:06:55| whether any infrastructure or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| So we looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| If you look in the staff report, you can see that we didn't really identify any changes of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| that warranted amending the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| There haven't been any significant new roads or utilities in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| There doesn't appear to be an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| and the existing sector plan for this area actually did not even recognize the CA commercial that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4045)|
| 1:07:35| This is in a rural area of the growth policy plan, which would make rezoning to CA very challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4055)|
| 1:07:47| or other commercial uses very challenging in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| So we did not identify anything that warranted a change in the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| Thank you. Commissioner Rolfe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| We're talking, in my mind, I differentiate from neighborhood commercial and strictly commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| because it's two different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| I mean, there's things you can do in commercial that you can't do in neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| and I kind of like what Lou said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| I'm not opposed to neighborhood commercial in places like this that provide services for the people that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| If there was somebody who wanted to have a commercial use here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| I don't know the county's PD process as well as the city's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| but could this be eligible for a plan development type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| if there was a specific use that was benefiting to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| Ten acres minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I mean, I think that's really a tough question to try to answer the validity of a plan development at a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| but we could talk to an applicant about that if that's something they were interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4142)|
| 1:09:11| Is there not a ten acre minimum, Ms. Albertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| For a plan development in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| Nonetheless, let's continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| Yeah, I was just asking that because, you know, if we can check that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| just in thoughts of how there could be a potential commercial use that could benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| like there are other alternative ways that might work better, more conforming than just a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4177)|
| 1:09:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| All right, we have a motion to deny the sector plan by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Seeing no other likes, all in favor to deny, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| We've got two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| All right, motion carries 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| Chair will entertain, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| Make a motion to deny CN Neighborhood Commercial Zone per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| Motion to deny the rezoning by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| Seeing no likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| Same 11-2. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4239)|
| 1:10:51| Moving on to agenda item number 23, the applicant, Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| Location, northeast side of Keller Bend Road, north of Hunter Valley Lane, 5.11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| Present zoning, floodway, office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| Zoning requested, floodway, OB, office medical and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| and office medical and related services, floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| Existing land use is office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| Approve the floodway zone for the area below the 813 contour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| the OB slash F office medical and related services floodway zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4292)|
| 1:11:41| for the area between the 813 contour and the current OA office park zoning boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| and the OB office medical and related services zone for the remainder of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| as shown in Exhibit A, because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| The applicant is present, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I'd like to hear the opposition first, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| The opposition is welcome to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4337)|
| 1:12:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| My name is Patra Bonham Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| I live at 2825 Keller Bend Road for 37 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| So I'm very familiar with this property, but I'd just like to say happy holidays to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Any new faces, I haven't been here in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| But anyway, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| So I'm sort of disappointed in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| given some conditions that are not actually mentioned or clarified in their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| We have questions that we would like perhaps you'll answer for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| So we have questions as well as comments, because there's a lot of unknowns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| So the two main issues that Keller Bend has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| and I represent Keller Bend Homeowners Association and other residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| including Mr. Mishu, who live on Hunter Valley Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| So the two primary issues that we're here for before you today are, number one, is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| For 37 years, we have been concerned with safety on Keller Bend Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| As some planned and sprawling development has occurred, that concern has not gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| And the second is the character of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| So that's important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| And I might need you to shrink that down a little so we can even get most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Enlarge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| I don't know what the right term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Reverse it so we can get most of Hunter Valley on there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| But I guess I'll just start with a few questions, and then Mr. Mullins, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| or you all can answer them as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| What is actually proposed currently for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| Because OB and OA are quite different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| And it's interesting that the characterizations of the surrounding property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| which I'm going to get into in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| And all of this really matters because the OB does allow residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| and it also allows a 45-foot building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| There are these distinctions that say the OB is for smaller individual buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| and the OA is for large office parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| The reality of that property is there might not be more than a half to three-quarters of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| above the flood line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| So you can say you have 5.11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| My husband and I own property further up there on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| which I could point out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| And it's so many acres too, but a lot of it is underwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| So you really can't, you know, you can say you have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| and you can even pay taxes on it, but you can't develop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| So saying you've got 5.11 or 5.09, depending on which one you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| is only relevant if you know how much of that is actually buildable above the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| Another question we have is why are we doing anything with the rezoning in the floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| I really don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| You can't develop in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| There's restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| You can park in there maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| I think parking is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Mr. Reynolds can maybe address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| But anyway, these are the kinds of questions we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| because are they planning to put a four-story apartment building there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| When I passed the building on the way out to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| there were 10 cars in the parking lot that's existing now, and it was full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4563)|
| 1:16:11| There's also a 25-foot setback requirement from the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| and there's also landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| There's just not a lot of usable land there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Right now it's a building that looks like a residence, and it's used as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| And to call that, even though it is technically OA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| it is not what you would really call an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| There are office parks nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| which now leads me to question some of the comments that the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| And a big reason that they recommend this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| is because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| At the corner of Keller Bend and North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| there's a residence, an antebellum residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| that has been there for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| And then behind that, to the south and the west, there is an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| And originally when that was planned, it only had an entrance on Keller Bend Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| but it does have its main entrance now coming out by the McDonald's, Walgreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| There's a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| That's where most of that traffic goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Most of that traffic from that office park does not come on to Keller Bend Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| Right across from that property is a residence, and it is used for music lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| If you could wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| If you could wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Your time is almost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| The thing is, right across the street from this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| and all along Hunter Valley Road are residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| And if you added the property of the residences, there's an event place there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| But if you added the property, the acreage of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| across the street and all along Hunter Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| that property would way outweigh this property that is proposing to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| I challenge that it would equal the property for the big office park that's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| So in keeping with our neighborhood, then, in summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| building more buildings there, whether they're apartment buildings or office buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| seems impossible due to the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| And I guess I'll wrap up by saying, since you're going to cut me off either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| it's a blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| It's a blind curve in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| There have been accidents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| And everybody going down, Keller Bend, Tools Bend, Tedford, they got to pass right by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| So I submit to you that this should not be approved for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| And our neighborhood and nearby residents all oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| I appreciate the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| I had conversations with one individual in the 4th District, Keith Brett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| who made some comments online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| I didn't know anybody else was opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| No one else reached out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| This sector plan for this property is office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| It is zoned OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| There's OB and agriculture in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| Currently, the property is being used as office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| and that is the intent moving forward, to continue to use the property as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| My clients are the owners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| They have two businesses on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| There's a union home mortgage company and Stephen W. Hackney Landscape Architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| And when the county approached them about putting this pump station to help with the flooding in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| it kind of made them think, well, maybe there's something else we can do with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| in addition to the way we're using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| They intend to keep using it for their businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| but what they thought about doing, it is a difficult piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| There's not a lot of developable ‑‑ I'll agree with Ms. Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| There's not a lot of developable property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| You can only develop what's above the 813,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| and you can't do anything but park when it's below the no fill line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| So there's a very constrained amount there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| But what they wanted to do, what their concept was, is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| we have clients that come in from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| We'd like to build some residences, some cottages there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| They could stay in while they're out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Potentially, they could even lease that to other individuals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| And because of the concerns, because of the flooding, because of the curve there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| because it's a wonky piece of property and there's some difficult zoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| I reached out to Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| I reached out to Knox Planning before I even filed the application and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| here's what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| It looks like O.B. is a better zone for it because O.A. is for large office parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| O.B. is for smaller office uses, which is really what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| This should be O.B. based upon the way it's being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| And that would also allow some flexibility for some residential units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| if it can be designed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| We can't put an apartment complex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| I think at most you could put three individual homes on there without subdividing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| And Ms. Rule just asked where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| We would have to go through and go through the whole engineering process about designing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| The O.B. zone only allows us the opportunity to try to design it and try to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| Maybe you could only put two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| Maybe you can only put one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Maybe you won't be able to do any at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| but we won't know if we aren't allowed that opportunity to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| And so we're asking for a zone that's consistent with what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| that may allow some more flexibility to allow them some better use of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| that's not going to cause a minimal impact, if anything, to what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| I mean, it is in a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| And, you know, as you're pulling out, you can see 300 feet at least to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| You can see 500 feet going to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| Site distance would have to be confirmed by engineering at the time of any new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| But that's just been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| You turn it out of there, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| You have the minimum site distance required for a 30-mile-per-hour street, which is what Keller Bend is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| So we're just asking for an opportunity for zoning that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| for an opportunity to see if we can design this in a way that would allow for some accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| allow them to put some cottages on there, two, three cottages maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| that they could lease out and use for their clients when they're in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| These are professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| I mean, one of them is a landscaping engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| They understand the difficulties in trying to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| So we're just asking for an opportunity to ask, can we get this done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| Can we design it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| That's going to be the real issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| and we'll have to work with Knox County Engineering to make sure we address all these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| They don't want anybody to be unsafe out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| But, you know, this zoning is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| It's consistent with what is already developed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| And, you know, it makes sense for them, and it would make sense, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| to allow them to have some flexibility to use this for residential use at some point if they needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| So I'd ask that you follow staff's recommendation and allow the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| and I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Whose case is this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| I've forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| It's Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Can you clarify for me in terms of the height difference that was brought up by the applicant and opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| the difference allowed in OA versus OB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| The OA zone has a maximum height of 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| The OB zone has a height of no building or structure shall exceed four stories or 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5021)|
| 1:23:50| And it has some exceptions where there is an exception that allows planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| to consider a greater height in the OB zone through a use under review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| So there's a 10-foot allowance difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| So 35 and 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| OA to OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| The only other thing I wanted to pedantically remind the commission about is that what folks intend to do with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5050)|
| 1:24:20| isn't what we're supposed to be making a decision about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| It's, you know, is this the right zone for that property regardless who owns it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| Not only is it a blind curve, it's a very skinny blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| I've been hauling horse trailers around that turn for the last 35-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| So that's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Another concern of mine is the rezoning of the current OA to the 813 contour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5089)|
| 1:24:57| considering this piece of property has flooded more than any other piece of property on the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| We had the flood of 2019, which flooded almost every property on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| But this one also flooded, I believe, in 2020 or 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| The basement flooded again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| So I don't understand, I guess, the need to rezone part of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| Can you explain that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Mr. Snowden, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Obviously, we have project in the works that we're going to install a pump station at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5133)|
| 1:25:42| that will significantly reduce the flood risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| Obviously, TVA maintains that flood elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| but we're confident that with the repairs to the culvert that runs under the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| as well as the new pump station that we can maintain the water service elevation at 813 and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| And with respect, the pump station is not there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| And the property has flooded multiple times in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| and has almost flooded again, even with the temporary pump station there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| So I'm hesitant to approve just based on that until the pump station has been installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| and is proven to work, for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5190)|
| 1:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Mr. Mullins, how much property is available between the 813, above the 813?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| Well, Mike sent me these numbers before I filed the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| Above the 813, he estimated there to be approximately 47,000 square feet above the 813.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| With the existing office space that's there, he estimated that to be 14,700 square feet of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| available for building, parking, drawbys, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| I think it's about 32,000 square feet of land area that could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| Each house in the OB zone must have 10,000 square feet of land area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| so that's where we came up potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| Three houses could be constructed on the site without subdividing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| You're not going to be able to subdivide that property coming back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| It's too constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| So that's the reason we're looking at some very limited residential cottage uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| that would all be above the 813.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| We couldn't rebuild the office where it is now because the no-fill line runs right through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| That office is grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| So, I mean, yes, it does flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| The homes could be located would be well above the 813 and well above the no-fill line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Chairman Hill, I'd like to make a motion, if I may, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| I recommend that we approve the or make a motion we approve the F floodway zone area between the 813 contour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5274)|
| 1:28:03| the OB office medical-related services floodway zones for the area between the 813 contour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| and the current office park zoning boundary in the OB medical office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| and related services zone for the remainder of the property as shown in Exhibit A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| because it is consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| So it's a motion to approve staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| We've got a motion to approve for staff recommendation by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| seconded by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| I hear two noes, I think, Ms. Karen, but you can verify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| Vice Chair Hooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| Motion carries 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5340)|
| 1:29:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Let's move to agenda item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| The applicant is David, please excuse me if I mispronounce this, Cheban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| The application, north side of Jenkins Road, east of Pine Bark Drive, west of Summer Spring Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| 1.9 acres, present zoning agricultural and low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| zoning requested, planned residential, and existing land use, single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| Density proposed, five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Staff recommendation, approve the PR zone at a density of up to four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Harbin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| I'll briefly introduce the project right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| I'm David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive, surveyor and engineer for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| The owner is Mr. Cheban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| He's here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| He can speak to the end use of this project right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| This is a small residential project that's on Jenkins Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| which is a minor collector within the growth boundaries and within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| So we have a right to ask for up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| We have asked up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| So we would just urge that the Planning Commission grant our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| It's a small piece, about 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| We could go down to 4.2 units an acre, so that would be our request if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| I know staff has recommended four, but we would ask that you would go with 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| So we'll be glad to answer any questions that the community may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| Anyone from opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| Mr. Yoder, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| And then Mr. Finningworth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| And then Ms. Jennifer Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Does that cover everyone that chose to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| Did you sign up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| So we've got five minutes here among four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| We've got four speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| So I would ask either designate a spokesperson or please be aware that you have other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5518)|
| 1:32:06| I can be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Mr. Yoder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| My name is Danny Ray Yoder, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| I live at 7528 Jenkins Road, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| I've been there 23 years, 60 years old, and I've lived there in this area my whole entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| The question I have in regard to this, they're wanting four units per acre on this track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5545)|
| 1:32:35| and you can see the surrounding area, it's not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| I'm on three-quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| All my neighbors are on, you know, three-quarters to an acre, which is not consistent with what's zoned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5561)|
| 1:32:49| My main concern is I live directly across the street in the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5569)|
| 1:32:57| It's become a main pathway between Joe Hinton and Chirpit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| With all the development we've got going on in Carnes on the ball road, the four-lane extension going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5584)|
| 1:33:14| and everybody every morning is trying to cut through there, it's a hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| The road goes up the hill, around the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| The curve is pitched directly towards my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| My main concern is if they build this many units in that smaller area, the roof coverage on that plot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5603)|
| 1:33:31| all the rain that's accumulated on each roof is going to be directed to us, a guttering system down in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| They'll have to pave so many lots or parking spots per unit he proposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| and all that's going to funnel that in right on top of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| It comes in my front yard right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| The road, there's no drainage ditch either side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| The road, my yard is directly, it's just a straight plane, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| We have issues with traffic now because there's no speed brakes or stop signs in between Jenkins or Joe Hinton and Chirpit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5639)|
| 1:34:11| It's nothing to see average speeds, 50, 60-mile-an-hour people come around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| and we have accidents all the time right there in that one area because it is a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| You have to go up to the top crest of the hill and then over, and then it goes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| and it's in a curve pitched right at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| So all that stuff funnels into my yard and my neighbor's yard and below me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| Thank you, Mr. Yoder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Mr. Fenningworth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| My name is Glenn Fenningworth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| I live directly across from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| My principal objection is associated with the fact that this is not consistent with the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| contrary to what the staff recommendation appears to imply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| They state in here that to the north, south, east, and west, it's all single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| However, the staff recommendation says because it's consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| This is all single-family development around this, so going with multifamily in adjacent areas is not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| So, first of all, that's my objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| But additional to that is when we're talking about the number of properties that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| and the estimated traffic impact is 99 entrances and exits per day, as Danny indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| this is right at the crest of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| There's a blind place down the hill and a blind place up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| Coming out of my own driveway, which is directly across from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| I fear for my life every time we come and go because, as he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| people don't obey the 30-mile-an-hour speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| People go anywhere from 40 to 60 miles an hour, especially this red Charger that's been in my neighborhood more recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| But in any case, it's very dangerous, and I think adding to the traffic is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| Drainage is a considerable issue, not to mention the fact I don't think apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| which tend to attract younger people who might have children, are appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| We see accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| In my submission, I also drew a map that had indication of where accidents have occurred right in my front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5760)|
| 1:36:08| and in adjacent yards, so I think this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| I really recommend against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Thank you, Mr. Penningworth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Ms. Long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| My name is Jennifer Long, and I'm a resident at 7531 Jenkins Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| I also echo the same concerns regarding the rezoning in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| and making it consistent with the current land use in the current community on Jenkins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| In addition, I also echo the traffic concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| and a recent concern specific to my property is a vehicle hitting my mailbox and causing some minor property damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5804)|
| 1:36:53| As we continue to experience growth on our road, I believe I would be directly impacted by that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5813)|
| 1:37:01| Also, I know I represent concerns of the Summer Place community in subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5821)|
| 1:37:08| in that we have drainage problems that start at the top of the hill, then drains into two properties that are above me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| then to the property owners behind me, into my property, and to the property that is also adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| So as we move forward, I ask that the rezoning commission consider, and the request for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| consider the drainage issues in the area and the impact that this will have in the residents of Jenkins community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| As we consider, I would be opposed to apartments and duplexes as dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| and I would be in favor of one single dwelling unit as part of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| I think we had one more speaker that, if commission doesn't object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5871)|
| 1:38:01| if we could keep it to approximately 30 seconds, and I'll extend the time for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| Yes, my name's James Cooper, and I own the adjacent property in question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| And I would be opposed because of, like they had said, other properties in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5896)|
| 1:38:24| there's nothing that would warrant this being four units per acre in this area, plus the blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5904)|
| 1:38:33| There's been numerous wrecks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| This would open up drainage problems, like was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5917)|
| 1:38:46| It's just too small of a unit to warrant that many divisions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| I wouldn't be opposed to, there's an existing house now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| The house is going to be torn down, two new houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| But trying to put eight or nine units in there, yes, I would have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Okay, thank you all for your service here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| Yes, on this, we're looking at deplexes on this site right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| Obviously, the drainage or detention, I'll take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| We'll put the detention on the property and make sure that we don't make it any worse than it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| We'll meet all of Knox County's standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| On this note, we need a wide variety of housing options in Knox County, and this thing came available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| We're within the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| We're not asking for sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| We're asking for basically to build four more duplexes on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| It's such a small site right there that, you know, for the traffic and for the impact to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| it's really quite small what we're asking for in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| Mr. Chabon is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| I'll let him speak a minute on just what he envisions for the site and what he plans to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| I am David Chabon, and I'm the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Please state your address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Please state your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| My address is 5331 Kane Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| And so we are requesting for seven additional units on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| and it would total eight, including the house that we have there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| And the house will not be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| We have updated it and put a concrete driveway, and so the house is going to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| And my parents live there, and so I'm not planning to do anything that will hurt anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| including the house that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| And so regarding the erosion, I guess we will have an engineer that will get all the calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| and figure out the drainage issue, so that shouldn't have any impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| We have good visibility where the driveway, where the proposed entrance will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| It's actually better visibility than there is right now at Summer Spring Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| And so with that being said, I don't think there will be any additional issues with the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| and anything else, you know, provided what we have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| But that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Ms. Warner, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| I heard, I think, at least three folks say that this doesn't reflect the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| Would you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| My comment with that is that the remaining agricultural areas, since about 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| have been building out at the PR of Fort Doyen at Seneca along Jenkins Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| and so that's why their recommendation was for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| I think this probably is geared towards engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| Mr. Snowden, I mean, there was mention of several car accidents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| I mean, is this, I know you guys kind of rank those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| Does this road rank anywhere near the top of your list right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| Let me pull up the crash history on that, and I can tell you that, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| Hang on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| I can just comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| Just looking at the aerials on it, though, I mean, it looks to be the road looks to be about 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| maybe 22 feet wide in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| I believe the minimum is 18 feet from a Knox County perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| So it seems to be, even though we might have some speeding issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| and I certainly can relate to that with the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| but it might be even larger than a lot of the roads in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| As far as zoning density, again, looking at the maps, just as the crow flies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| I'm seeing four dwelling units an acre within 900 feet of the property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| So granted, some of it's zoned RA, which if you converted that over into a planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| it might be slightly lower than four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| but I would agree that the pattern for sure in that area, it's a good West Knoxville location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| very popular, convenient, a lot of things up and down Middlebrook Pike in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| But, Mr. Stone, did you find that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| The crashes that we've looked at, we haven't maintained 10 years of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| We don't show any reported crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| Now, granted, there may have been some that folks may have ran off the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| didn't warrant a reported crash to the sheriff's office, but in the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| we haven't, at least there's not a documented crash in the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| There's a couple at the intersection down either side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| but from our perspective, it doesn't appear to be a problematic crash location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| Okay. Thank you for looking that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| Mr. Harvin, real quick, you had mentioned your request was five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| but you were comfortable at 4.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| That works out okay for you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| I would tend to be in support of that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you, Chair Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| I just want to commend you for proposing a different type of residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6260)|
| 1:44:27| especially in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| We don't see a lot of duplexes come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| I know that you had asked for 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| It looks like at 1.9 acres, you're just slightly under 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| I don't know if that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| I guess my question for Whitney is, is that an issue for 4.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| if he wants to build eight duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| I've actually surveyed the property, and after dedication, it's really like 1.94 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| so 4.2 would work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| So we're comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Chairman Hill, yes, I'd like to make a motion to approve PR plane residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| up to a density of 4.2 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| We have a motion to approve 4.2 dwelling units per acre by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Let's take a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| Okay, let's reconvene and get started with agenda item 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| The applicant is Sean Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| Location is north side of High Meadow Drive, east of Lovell Road, 1.21 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| Present zoning, low-density residential, technology overlay, planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| Zoning requested, planned residential with technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Density proposed, four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| Staff recommendation, approve the PR, the planned residential technology overlay zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| with up to four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| because it is consistent with the northwest county sector plans MUSD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| NWCO-4 land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| Seeing no opposition, would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Sean Smith with Dreamhouse Construction, 9051 Executive Park Drive, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| I would like to say with the staff recommendation of up to four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| if the commission was not comfortable with that because of the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| the road frontage, our actual objective is to subdivide into actually three lots on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6421)|
| 1:47:09| The subdivision adjoining it, which is High Meadow, which you'll see there on the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| those lots, that would give us three lots, an average of 17,530 square feet per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6434)|
| 1:47:23| There's 30 lots in the subdivision there that adjoins it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| and two-thirds of them average from 14,000 to 16,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| Some are larger, that were apparently a double lot when originally subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| So we feel like we would be in harmony with the adjoining neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| So we're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| If you don't like the number four, something less works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I've got a light here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| I'm walking away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Last chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| Last chair is awake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| I was prepared to make a motion to approve the staff recommendation up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| because it is consistent with the Northwest County Sector Plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| MUSD Northwest CO-4 land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6485)|
| 1:48:12| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| seconded by Commissioner Phillips to approve her staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6496)|
| 1:48:27| I'd like to take a moment for Ms. Poitier to comment on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| We were just going to do a short presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| I don't know if you all still feel it's warranted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| but it was going to come to you because it was denied at the TTCDA meeting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| Monday due to a lack of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| So no one made a motion to deny it, just no one made a motion to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| and therefore it was denied, which is very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| So that's why we wanted to present to you all so you understood the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| But since there's already a motion, I'll leave that to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| If you feel like you need to know more information, I'm happy to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| And if not, we can just move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| I think the more the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| So to make things easier, we'll just go in order of the contextual images.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| So this property is on the east side of Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| just south of Pellissippi Parkway by around 900 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| So to provide some context, it is in the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| the northern half of the site, though it's not very heavily sloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| And moving down to look at the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| this is kind of when we get into the criteria of the zoning ordinance around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| whether we can recommend approval of a rezoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| So since around 2004, the properties to the north have been transitioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| into commercial properties from ag and RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| And so the change of conditions is previous zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| there's a trend in this area for these properties to be flipping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| to higher intensity uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| And looking at the sector plan, you can see that it's MUSD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| Northwest County 4, which is the Saddlebrook area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| This specific mixed-use designation calls for the technology park zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| the office zone, medium-density residential-slash-office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6604)|
| 1:50:10| and community commercial, which in turn allows office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| general commercial, and highway commercial in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| So the proposed PR zone with up to four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| is actually less intense than the zones that are allowed by that MUSD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| or recommended by that MUSD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| The MDR-O zone, or the MDR-slash-O zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| recommends up to 5 to 12 dwelling units per acre in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| So we feel like this is consistent with the Northwest County sector plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| land-use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| And moving on to look at the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| this is kind of where it gets a little bit –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| you can kind of see very faintly on the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| there is a closed contour, which could indicate the presence of a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| So if it is determined that that's a sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| then there would be a 50-foot buffer that would be needed to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| around that sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| So the PR zone really is to provide for clustering and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| when there is a site with constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| And so due to the HP area and the closed contour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| indicating a potential sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| we feel like the PR at up to four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| would provide them with some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| Also should be noted that the existing RA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| has a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| which is roughly four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| And then finally going down to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| So I did a measurement of the area of each of the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| along this same street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| and they ranged in size really from around 3.7 acres –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| 0.37 acres was the smallest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| So, you know, the applicant has indicated that they'd be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| with three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| so whether or not you vote for three or four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| the size of lots that could be combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| wouldn't be too far off from what's already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| And, again, we feel like this use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| because it fronts along Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| would be a little bit more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| than what you see on that side street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| but it's not what we would not want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| on an arterial street like Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| So it either would be something like this or something commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| so this would be even less intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| and for that reason staff supports the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Porsche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| So she said everything I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Okay, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Let's just go ahead with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| All right, so we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6760)|
| 1:52:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Agenda item number 30 will require three motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| some variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| The applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| It's the subdivision concept development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| Subdivision is Fairview Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Applicant, developer, Masana Investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| Location, west side of Fairview Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| east side of Beeler Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| 95.83 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| Zoning planned residential floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| Number of lots, 128.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| It will require, looks like two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6815)|
| 1:53:42| Alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| Staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| the first motion would be to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| the requested variances and alternative design standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| based on the justification provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| by the applicant and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| Motion two on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| would be to approve subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| Motion number three would be approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| for a residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| with up to 128 detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| and a reduction of the 35 foot peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| setback to 25 feet for lots 207 through 212| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| as shown on the plan, subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| Mr. Davis, would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| Proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| and I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6888)|
| 1:54:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| My name is Joseph Haddad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| I live at 7828 Beeler Farms Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| I want to start by thanking you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| I've learned a great deal about the important work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| that you all do and I appreciate all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| and effort of you and your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| that you guys put into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| I'm here today to convince the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| not to allow this plan to go forward as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| Some of you may be surprised I'm here at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| given that Mr. Davis is no longer seeking to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| his development to Beeler Farms subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| of which I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| But the reason why I'm here is because the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| as it stands is simply to make my problem someone else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| and I can't do that with good conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| The number of units and the single point of entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| is still a huge area of concern except now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| there's no one to advocate for the future homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| Now we're talking about over 210 houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| with only one point of entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| If Mr. Davis insists on connecting to another subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| then I request that you enforce the zone density rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| of two dwelling units per acre as noted in the case file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| This gives him about 66 homes plus the 88 townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| in the other subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| That puts the total of units just over the recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| 150 home limit for a single entrance subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| It would be reasonable to allow an exception of a few homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| and still have only one entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| It's not reasonable to approve a plan that is asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| for 60 homes over the recommended limit for one entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| At that point you're setting a new precedence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| and throwing the rule out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| Another alternative is that if Mr. Davis insists on more units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| then he could provide his own entrance to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| It's not an impossible feat of engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| to cross the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| The intersection of Fairview and Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| literally sits on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| We know Mr. Davis could have his own entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| if he chose to do so but he's avoiding the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| of crossing the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| But this alternative only solves the issue of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| but doesn't address the concerns about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| I would like to request if this is chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| that the development have a maximum density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| of 3.25 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| as is the case for Beeler Farm subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| and the case for the townhomes concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| Whatever the plan is, either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| I'm not objecting to developing the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| It's the number of houses being crammed into such a small area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| and the way Mr. Davis keeps proposing access to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| that is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| This current proposal doesn't reflect the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| of existing subdivisions in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| and it's not symbiotic to its neighboring subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| or as Commissioner Higgins put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| it's still a parasitic relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| At the end of the day, if he insists on piggybacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| off another subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| then 150 home limit for one entrance should be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| If he insists that he needs more houses to make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| then the density should match the other subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| And I recommend the subdivision have its own entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| But if the math doesn't work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| then there are other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| that he could choose to develop instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7080)|
| 1:58:08| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| I'd like to take a minute to address some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| I heard vocalized during the agenda review meeting on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| around connectivity and stub-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| In this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| connectivity has been an issue for access to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| Back in July, I actually stood at this podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| and for the property that we're going through right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| I advocated for connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| In that case, it was particularly connectivity to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| But if I recall, it was either that case or one two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| where I also was advocating for connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| over the ridge to the east and was told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| well, that's not really feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| It's got terrain, and so we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| But here we are today looking to do exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| And from the Knox County Planning Alliance perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| connectivity is something that adds to our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| You can see we've done a lot of cul-de-sac subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| We've got a lot of thermometers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| And those are attractive for those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| because you don't have much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| Maybe you can set up your basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| in the cul-de-sac at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| So I understand the attractiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| And it's good for the people that live on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| As a community as a whole, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| it forces us into very limited traffic patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| with lots of choke points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| and also it puts a lot of traffic on your major arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| Connectivity, either grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| or just providing multiple connection points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| that adds two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| One, it adds resilience to our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| It gives you multiple paths to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| So if one path doesn't work really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| there are other paths that you can travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| The other thing is it adds a sense of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| and connectedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| In the comments back in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| and then also two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| I pointed out that just on the other side of Beeler Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| there's a big subdivision that's built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| And if you want to go from that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| to the one on the back side of it a little bit farther west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| it's about 2.6 miles, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| travel either by foot or car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| That's, you know, that's two houses back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| So that doesn't really help our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| be connected and build a sense of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| So I'm here advocating for connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| and changes to the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| that might make that clearer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| Yeah, I appreciate your all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| And I first want to start off by apologizing to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| and apologizing to the folks in Beeler Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| and to Mr. Mike Reynolds and to Mr. Snowden and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| When I came before you all last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| I understood that I was getting the declarant rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| for Beeler Farms subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| which granted the developer, the declarant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| the right to extend the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| beyond its current boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| I subsequently found out that, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| the declarant rights had already been turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| We were not having right to declarant rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| So we withdrew that access coming through Beeler Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| And I apologize again to you all for misrepresenting something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| that I thought was true but was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| So since then, we have come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| and worked out a relationship with the builder next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| and purchasing that property, which is undeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| It's already been approved for a subdivision by you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| Nothing has been developed to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| It's raw land extending through that subdivision that is unbuilt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| connecting to this property off the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| And we've also agreed to provide a stub out to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| to the north as well as to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| which would allow for future connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| So to the best of our ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| we've tried to do everything that has been asked of us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| and I would respectfully request you all approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| as per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| I just want to briefly say I don't think that this is appropriate just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| I think that this many units does deserve two entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7343)|
| 2:02:29| and because the property touches a right-of-way on the opposite side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| I think that if this many units were to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| I would be supportive of a road that exits through the back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| And if there's not a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| I don't think that there should be this many units going through one single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| entryway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| I'd like to make a motion to approve the requested variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth to approve the requested variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| and alternative design standards per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| I see we still have some lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| For further discussion, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| Mr. Reynolds, your recommendation is for a stub out to the north, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| Did you just mention a stub out to the south as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| We had a discussion with Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| and we have agreed to allow for a stub out to the south as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| which would allow for future connectivity that would prevent what we came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| with last time we were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| But that's not in this staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| The south stub out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| I believe you referred to it being the unbuilt subdivision that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| been approved that you're bringing back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| we are actually going to provide a stub out to the property that we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| purchasing on the south of the future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| So that piece, if somebody ever decided to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| would have access to the larger piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| The piece adjacent to us and to the south has quite a bit of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| It's a major's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| It has quite a bit of frontage on Beeler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| The property that we're not purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| which is on the south side of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| providing a stub out there for future purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| if anybody opted to go to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| So on the concept plan, that would be somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7476)|
| 2:04:42| We have agreed to provide an access to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| which would be this way, to that property that we're not purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| Where on the approximately would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7493)|
| 2:05:06| I'm telling you today, that's what we have agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| We are offering that also in addition to the stub out to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| I guess the reason I bring that up is we just made a motion to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| concept plan as presented with a north access, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| No, we just made a motion to approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| Well, that's not a question where it was going to be, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Commissioner Rolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| So we've got, we're working on the variances and alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| And we've got Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| Is one of the variances, do the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| are they inclusive of asking for not having to have two entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| exits for this volume of house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| Won't that be decided in the concept on the next motion or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| The subdivision regulations don't have a specific number of lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| when a second access point is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| It's just an unwritten policy that we, as staff, try to, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| enforce but at least recommend that the additional access points be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| once you hit a certain number, which is 150 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| So there's not a variance that's required in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| If they exceed 150 and only have one access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| it's just part of the approval process for the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| So I guess let me rephrase that question now that I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| that it's just a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| Were it a policy, would it be in the variance list that we would be voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7612)|
| 2:06:59| Yeah, it would just be in the concept plan part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| Would it be in the concept plan or the variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| No, it would just be a part of the conditions of approval in the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| not in the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| Ready to go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| for staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| Oh, did I miss the concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| No, development is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| No, concept plan is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| Concept first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| Concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| Okay, I'd like to make a motion we approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| for staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| Okay, did we cover all of the concerns by the commissioners here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| on this particular motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| Let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| Let me make a motion we approve it pending the two stub-outs that they proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| So as adding a condition, is that appropriate, Mr. Reynolds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| It would be amending an existing condition of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| there's an existing condition to provide a stub-out to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| so it would be amending that condition to also include a stub-out to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| Stephanie's problem with an additional stub-out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| I mean, I think when we were considering it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| we were probably considering it more to stub-out to the south of the undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7708)|
| 2:08:35| portion of what was formerly called the B&B Builders Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| which is to the property that has fringe on Beeler Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| with the hope that it would be an easier connection to make a secondary access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| to Beeler Road eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| What Mr. Davis is suggesting is a stub-out to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| to the property that will remain part of the field and ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7736)|
| 2:09:03| which is who he's purchasing his property from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| The only access to a public road that that property has is to Fairview Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| which that does have access to another road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| So I think that there's been some concern in the past about that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| with Fairview, and I think that would have to be studied more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| if a new road connection came through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| But at this point, it does have access to a separate road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| So staff doesn't have a problem with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| I have no problem with providing a second access point or stub-out to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| I'm going to leave that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Okay, so we're going, just for clarification, Mr. Reynolds, correct me if I'm inaccurate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| but I think we're going to amend the item number six of the 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| Item number six to include the south stub-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7793)|
| 2:09:59| Is that correct, Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| Is that your intention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Okay, does everybody understand what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| Okay, so you made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| Commissioner Phillips has made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| Seeing no likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7813)|

| 2:10:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| All right, we've got a motion by Commissioner Roth to approve the development plan per staff recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7857)|

| 2:11:51| This will require three variances, along with alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7911)|
| 2:12:01| We've got three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| Staff recommendation is to approve variance one and two and the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7923)|
| 2:12:11| based on the justification provided by the applicant and recommendations of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7931)|

| 2:12:57| There will be a fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7977)|

| 2:13:04| On the development plan, the fourth and final motion would be to approve the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=7984)|

| 2:13:29| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8010)|

| 2:13:43| I'm Phillip Royer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| I live at 322 Triplett Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| I'm here with several of my neighbors, including the Gillenwaters, the Blakes, and the Crosses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| who are adjacent to this piece of property and access their property from Triplett Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8034)|
| 2:14:02| We were here earlier this year and opposed the density recommended by planning because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| we feared that the property would be stripped of all the trees, that we would have small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8047)|
| 2:14:15| lots, and that lots would be crammed up against the property line with the Gillenwaters, Blakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8055)|
| 2:14:23| and Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| And I have to say, all of our fears have been recognized and more when we look at this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| which really amounts to a rape of the Knox County landscape and makes a complete joke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8071)|

| 2:14:44| If you look at the plan, could we please have the plan there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8084)|
| 2:14:54| If you look at the plan from the proposed intersection of Fox Road, we have three roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| that climb steeply at 12% straight up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| They cross contours at perpendicular angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| And at the top of the hill, we have tiny lots jammed up against the property line of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8108)|
| 2:15:16| Gillenwaters, the Cross, and the Blakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| And the plan, to me, resembles a trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8119)|
| 2:15:27| We're looking at 60-foot lots marching their way up this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8127)|
| 2:15:34| And to really realize how bad it is, you have to think about it in three-dimensional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| And so I'm going to give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| We all probably travel or will travel on Main Street between Gay and State Streets today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8143)|
| 2:15:50| It's the street where you go down and speed on your way to James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8150)|
| 2:15:58| That block is 345 feet long and it descends 41 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| That's 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| That's what we're talking about on all three of these roads, all the way from Fox Road to the top, 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| And you've got lots stacked in there like cordwood all the way up to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8172)|
| 2:16:20| And if that design is not absurd enough, consider the fact that the developer is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8180)|
| 2:16:27| these tiny 60-by-115-foot lots regardless of this 12% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8187)|
| 2:16:36| So you've got 60-foot lots and you're going to be dealing with the narrow house footprints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8196)|
| 2:16:44| difficult driveway connections, retaining walls, neighbor-to-neighbor drainage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8204)|
| 2:16:50| side-sloping lawns that are not fit for any sort of outdoor activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8210)|
| 2:16:55| In fact, I guess a child's ball or a stroller would stand a good chance of rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8215)|
| 2:17:00| all the way down the hill and into Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| I urge you to reject this design and I urge you to require the following improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8225)|
| 2:17:12| One, increase the setback along the eastern boundary adjacent to the Cross Blakes and Killen Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8232)|
| 2:17:19| Increase it to 100 feet and prohibit removal of trees or grading in that steep zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8239)|
| 2:17:27| Two, preserve existing trees as much as possible rather than imposing a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| that necessitates the removal of all the trees for grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| Three, design streets that curve with the natural landscape rather than carving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| artificially imposed straight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| Four, decrease the grades of the new roads by following rather than crossing contours as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8266)|
| 2:17:54| Five, 12% grades should be the maximum and limited to short distances rather than the norm throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8274)|
| 2:18:04| Six, increase the size of the lots to be more compatible with the surrounding subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8284)|
| 2:18:10| These are the smallest lots anywhere on Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| And seven, concentrate on quality of lots rather than attempting to reach the maximum allowed density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8295)|
| 2:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8304)|
| 2:18:29| Anyone else to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8309)|
| 2:18:42| Please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| State your name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| I would be the Killen Water that was referenced in Mr. Warrior's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| I reside at 307 Tiplett Lane and I apologize for my comments not being submitted earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8332)|
| 2:19:01| I drove six hours here from Kentucky to appear and I'm in complete agreement with Mr. Warrior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8341)|
| 2:19:13| I joined Mr. Davis' proposed development and is noted at county commission on the most impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| My family's been there for five decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| What you don't see is I have a 50-acre estate, an operating horse farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| My current horse was inducted in the Equus Hall of Fame and we won ten world championships in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8366)|
| 2:19:32| This makes no difference to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| I mention this only because I expect things to be done well in my operation and on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8375)|
| 2:19:42| I conveyed this in a phone call with Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| I wished him well on his development but told him I only expected him to do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8386)|
| 2:19:53| I'm realistic enough to know that development's going to happen and will eventually to all or a large part of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8393)|
| 2:20:00| We also adjoin George Williams Road and we are prime development property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| I'm second generation, as is Blake, who also adjoins Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| Unfortunately, all of us in attendance saw the disasters of the construction at Castle Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| That's why we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| What you should know is county commission denied outright the extension upward of Castle Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| Mr. Warrior's comments are absolutely correct about the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| The topography is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| It's very wooded as well, not utilized in my operation except for privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| I question water flow when the woods are removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| The cypress trees are a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| I leave the density to a workable site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| This plan is not appropriate as Mr. Warrior described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| I was not initially opposed to foreign density, but his site plan makes me question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| In maximizing the potential density, Mr. Davis has not honored what was discussed at county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| and his proposed plan will create the exact same things we've seen before on this topography from Fox Road and Castle Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8459)|
| 2:21:07| It's not an example of Castle Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| It's not an example of what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| I wish him only the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| This isn't it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| I'm prepared to work with him on what will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8481)|
| 2:21:29| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| If my understanding is correct, 12% grade is what is acceptable in Knox County without a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| I think if you go over 12%, a variance is requested up to 15 at a max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8496)|
| 2:21:43| And also we're going into the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| If you come across a slope, it's very challenging because if you're coming across a slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| you have to cut your road in so you end up with lots high on one side, low on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8512)|
| 2:21:58| So when you're developing, at least from my experience, you're better at going with the grade of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8518)|
| 2:22:04| which we are doing with each of these three cul-de-sacs, to keep from doing a cross slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| which also reduces the amount of dirt you have to move on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| We have also said we speak to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| We'll try to leave a buffer on the backside to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| We don't ‑‑ taking down trees costs us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| If we can leave a buffer through there, we will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| I respect your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| You all approve as per NPC recommendation, and I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| Yeah, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| I mean, there was a mention of density effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| I mean, we know it's zoned four units an acre at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| but I think they had mentioned there weren't any smaller lots in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| But what I'm seeing is directly across the street, there are attached units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| but I'm seeing 45 B‑wide, something along that line up on Sunny Springs, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8576)|
| 2:23:05| I guess my point is it's an incredible location in the middle of West Knoxville off Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| which is next to the Pell City Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| There's multiple ways out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| You can get to Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| You can get over to Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| You can get up to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| I think it's an excellent location for a higher density than what we would normally see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8600)|
| 2:23:27| I honestly supported it at five units an acre when it came through originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| But with that being said, I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| I'm not sure which one you start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| Start with the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| Make a motion to approve variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| based on the justification provided by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Read the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8630)|

| 2:23:54| and the City of Knoxville Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| We have a motion by Commissioner Huber, seconded by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| on the two variances per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8646)|

| 2:24:24| I'd like to make a motion to approve variance number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| subject to providing justification for the intersection grade using AASHTO standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8666)|

| 2:24:35| pardon me, the City of Knoxville Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8675)|

| 2:24:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8696)|
| 2:24:57| Motion carries 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| I'd like to make a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| for a residential subdivision with up to 90 detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| John, fallback concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| We got to go back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| I was just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| I'd like to make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| We've got a motion by Commissioner Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| seconded by Commissioner Phillips to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8727)|
| 2:25:33| Seeing no light, we have one light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| Thank you, Chair Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| I just wanted to comment, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| I understand Commissioner Huber's response about why this is a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8741)|
| 2:25:46| I just would challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| I'm so tired of seeing development plans like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| And I know that the properties that we have left are limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| and they're topographically challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| But, gosh, I just wish that we could do more with our properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| to keep and preserve the natural beauty of a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8761)|
| 2:26:05| than just trying to put as many units as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| That's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| Yes, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| I echo Miss Midas' comments, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| I wish we had a little better handle on preserving our natural environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| particularly the tree canopies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| And, you know, we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| We can require the concept plans be developed by a landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8794)|
| 2:26:41| And that would certainly, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| go a long way toward improving the quality of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| Unfortunately, we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| So we're here tonight to approve or deny based on the existing standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| that we have, and I'll vote to approve the development plan and the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8813)|
| 2:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| So are there any amenities here besides just common area land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8824)|
| 2:27:12| There's not, like, a clubhouse or a just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| And then was there any consideration Mr. Reynolds maybe, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| got a stub out on this property, like the south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| I mean, I know someone who's in opposition here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| that that property could theoretically connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| Was that looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| We did look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| but I don't really foresee that the adjacent properties would provide much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| benefit to providing a stub out in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| The properties are too small and are potentially already developed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| I concur with Commissioner Midas and Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| I would like to ask to Commissioner Phillips' point of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| we can do better, we could do X, Y, Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| What we as the planning commission can actually do to take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| not on this case I understand what we're here to vote for or vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| but to not just leave it in the middle of the room and walk away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| and come back next month and have the same kind of comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| but what can we do to put on our agenda of work either for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| or for planning commission so we can make some changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| That's not a rhetorical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| That is a genuine question for someone else to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| I think what, you know, we have minimum subdivision guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| that we have to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| and that is where we need to begin to be able to set the standards higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| And maybe instead of they're like minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| you have some maximum standards out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| But the opportunities, you know, to try to modify that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| could potentially be done through incrementally through staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8945)|
| 2:29:09| but Knox County will be developed, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| Mr. Snowden beginning a development of a unified development ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8953)|
| 2:29:20| beginning this coming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| Jim, if the funding is there, the fall of this coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| to upgrade all the development ordinance for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| So I think that would be probably the best opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| to look at them all in a unified approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| instead of trying to do it a piecemeal between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| But that's my response right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| I think that would be a great opportunity for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| and this commission to weigh in on raising the standard of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8986)|
| 2:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| I want to just make a comment about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| Yeah, this is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| This layout, first of all, I completely agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| and apologize to the applicant that their case has led to so many comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9006)|
| 2:30:14| saying we need better standards for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| But just some feedback that I think could be helpful in a scenario like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9018)|
| 2:30:24| because I understand there's topographical challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| but looking at these three cul-de-sacs or thermometers as they've been called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9027)|
| 2:30:34| one thing that I think could be helpful to potential neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| that would be living here when talking about not just the connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| of their neighborhoods but also within a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9043)|
| 2:30:48| Obviously, I know you couldn't put a road connecting those three cul-de-sacs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| because of the topographical challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| but even if there was a sidewalk or walking path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| that could allow people to get from point A to point B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| if they're friends, I'm thinking about kids living on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| having to walk all the way down the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| and then all the way back up the other hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| or cutting through their neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| I just think that walkability does happen at a big scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| but could also happen at a small scale within neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| Little things like that even could go a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| So it's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| Thank you. Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| So we are on motion three, correct? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| And Commissioner Huber, we had the motion on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| seconded by Commissioner Phillips, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| And so all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| We have two noes. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| Commissioner Chelso and Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| Chelso and Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| 10-2. Motion passes 10-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| I'd like to make a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| for a residential subdivision with up to 90 detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| to approve the development plan per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| Any opposed say no. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| Mr. Chairman, if I could real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| Mr. Davis, you know, when I said we could do better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9152)|
| 2:32:35| I'm not being critical of your development necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| but yours is pretty much typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9158)|

| 2:32:43| We're getting into a lot of issues with topography in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| As the really flat land and what's really the best developable land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| is already gone or mostly gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9172)|

| 2:33:35| Mr. Davis and I have had our problems with development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| and I just want to say how much I appreciate you all for recognizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| This lady over here, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9225)|
