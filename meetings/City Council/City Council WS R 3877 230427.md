|     175 |   178 | Vice Mayor, thank you.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=175.0)  |
|     178 |   181 | That was a perfect summary of why we're here today.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=178.0)  |
|     181 |   185 | I think part of what is feeding this is that we are blessed                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=181.0)  |
|     185 |   189 | with remarkable growth through our city.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=185.0)  |
|     189 |   192 | We're also seeing a desire, as you said,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=189.0)  |
|     192 |   199 | to make sure we're giving attention to pedestrian-oriented travel, if you will,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=192.0)  |
|     199 |   204 | and that being incorporated into our zoning effort.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=199.0)  |
|     204 |   208 | What we will do is, with your permission,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=204.0)  |
|     208 |   212 | Jeff Welch will speak to what was presented back in November                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=208.0)  |
|     212 |   216 | to council based upon Planning Commission action.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=212.0)  |
|     216 |   224 | Brian Berry will then share some examples of where this may fit,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=216.0)  |
|     224 |   227 | and obviously that is your decision.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=224.0)  |
|     227 |   230 | We'll then bring a two-part recommendation to you                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=227.0)  |
|     230 |   234 | because we believe it will need to be taken in parts.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=230.0)  |
|     234 |   237 | Before we go much further in the discussion,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=234.0)  |
|     237 |   243 | because we're talking CG, I'll recognize Peter Ahrens to speak to CG1                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=237.0)  |
|     243 |   246 | and some of the thought processes that are going on there.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=243.0)  |
|     246 |   249 | I realize that's not necessarily what this meeting is about,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=246.0)  |
|     249 |   255 | but with it being CG, we thought it would be appropriate to bring you up to date on that.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=249.0)  |
|     255 |   259 | With that, I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Welch.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=255.0)  |
|     259 |   261 | Thank you, Harold.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=259.0)  |
|     261 |   265 | The good summary, Mr. Vice Mayor, I think you took my first slide,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=261.0)  |
|     265 |   266 | so we're in good shape.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=265.0)  |
|     266 |   268 | We're moving along very quickly.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=266.0)  |
|     268 |   271 | Again, as what Vice Mayor Roberto indicated,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=268.0)  |
|     271 |   280 | why we're here and the purpose of the CG2 and CG3, CG zoning districts are for.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=271.0)  |
|     280 |   284 | Again, try to help with the definitions, which is going to be hard to do.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=280.0)  |
|     284 |   288 | The Bill 2 zone is the area of a lot where a structure might locate                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=284.0)  |
|     288 |   291 | within the minimum and maximum range of setback provided,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=288.0)  |
|     291 |   295 | and the Bill 2 percentage specifies the percentage of the building façade                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=291.0)  |
|     295 |   299 | that must be located within a building line to build zone.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=295.0)  |
|     299 |   301 | Then our major arterials, which I think you fully understand,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=299.0)  |
|     301 |   304 | those are pretty much our state highways,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=301.0)  |
|     304 |   312 | and the purpose of major arterial is really to move traffic from our collector streets                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=304.0)  |
|     312 |   319 | and then move traffic for relatively long distances throughout our city and county.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=312.0)  |
|     319 |   322 | So given the arterial street layout and length of many of these streets,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=319.0)  |
|     322 |   328 | the application of the Bill 2 zones and Bill percentages, after further consideration,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=322.0)  |
|     328 |   333 | will not create a pedestrian-oriented environment along some of our major.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=328.0)  |
|     333 |   336 | When you're looking at Kingston Pike west of North Shore and that area,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=333.0)  |
|     336 |   340 | it's not an attractive built pedestrian environment there.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=336.0)  |
|     340 |   344 | And so we're looking at what we want to define as walkable areas.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=340.0)  |
|     344 |   349 | Walkable areas, you know, you have safe space, comfortable space to walk,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=344.0)  |
|     349 |   354 | attractiveness and a connectivity between your activity centers there,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=349.0)  |
|     354 |   360 | connecting from an arterial to a collector or whatever, making it a very walkable area.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=354.0)  |
|     360 |   364 | And, again, some of our arterials, the further you go outside the city,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=360.0)  |
|     364 |   370 | the central core are not, in that sense, a friendly walkable area,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=364.0)  |
|     370 |   376 | and I don't think they ever will be for quite some time.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=370.0)  |
|     376 |   386 | So the planning commission in their recommendation to city council was an add Section C to Article 5.3                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=376.0)  |
|     386 |   394 | and that the NCG2 and CG3 jurisdictions along the following sections of the major arterial,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=386.0)  |
|     394 |   400 | as shown on the map, Bill 2 percentages and Bill 2 zones do not apply.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=394.0)  |
|     400 |   403 | So the areas that we're looking at, again, I'll show a map in a minute,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=400.0)  |
|     403 |   409 | but North Broadway, north of Ridgewood Road, Chapman Highway, south of Yonge High Pike,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=403.0)  |
|     409 |   414 | Asheville Highway, east of Prosser Road, Kingston Pike, west of Bearden Road,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=409.0)  |
|     414 |   417 | and south North Shore Drive, east of White Tower Drive.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=414.0)  |
|     418 |   428 | Again, these are parts of those major arterials that the Bill 2 percentages and Bill 2 zones will not apply.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=418.0)  |
|     428 |   436 | So we make an exception for those sections of those major arterials that we feel that these are not attractive,                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=428.0)  |
|     436 |   441 | safe, walkable areas and will not be for the foreseeable future.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=436.0)  |
|     441 |   449 | So these areas that are outlined in black are the definitions graphically showing where the Bill 2 zones                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=441.0)  |
|     449 |   452 | and the dimensional standards will not apply.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=449.0)  |
|     454 |   460 | So, again, on Asheville Highway, Chapman Highway, south North Shore Drive, Kingston Pike,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=454.0)  |
|     460 |   463 | and then North Broadway and Maryville Pike area.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=460.0)  |
|     464 |   469 | With that, I'll entertain any questions or turn it over to Brian to give some specific examples                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=464.0)  |
|     469 |   475 | of some of those strategies and some of the real case situations.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=469.0)  |
|     477 |   478 | Council Member Sang.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=477.0)  |
|     478 |   483 | Thank you. Is this a list we're going to add to?                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=478.0)  |
|     483 |   491 | This is the list where we exempt the Bill 2 standards of these areas will be exempted in a C2 and CG3,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=483.0)  |
|     491 |   496 | be exempted from those Bill 2 zones and Bill 2 percentages. Exempt.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=491.0)  |
|     496 |   498 | But like I'm thinking about Clinton Highway.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=496.0)  |
|     499 |   500 | Pardon me?                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=499.0)  |
|     500 |   501 | Clinton Highway.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=500.0)  |
|     501 |   502 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=501.0)  |
|     502 |   504 | That feels like another area.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=502.0)  |
|     510 |   516 | I can't recall why Clinton Highway was exempted, whether there was not that much C2, C3 zone through that area.                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=510.0)  |
|     516 |   521 | So I don't have that. I'm sorry. I do not have a response for that, quite honestly.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=516.0)  |
|     524 |   525 | Council Member Ryder.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=524.0)  |
|     525 |   537 | Yeah, I just was going to comment that I have the map up and it looks like Western is CH1 and then Clinton Highway is commercial highway as well. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=525.0)  |
|     537 |   540 | Yes, mostly CH zone problems.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=537.0)  |
|     541 |   542 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=541.0)  |
|     543 |   544 | Council Member Thomas.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=543.0)  |
|     544 |   551 | Yes, Mr. Welch, how would exempting the requirements improve pedestrian access?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=544.0)  |
|     551 |   559 | It would not. What we're saying is that the environment along these sections of the arterial that are highlighted on the map                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=551.0)  |
|     559 |   566 | are not going to be attractive for pedestrian-orientated commercial development.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=559.0)  |
|     566 |   574 | These sections that are highlighted on the maps are more auto-orientated corridors                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=566.0)  |
|     575 |   587 | where you have a lot more vehicular traffic, a lot more development that is already heavily commercial and with drive-throughs and that nature.   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=575.0)  |
|     587 |   594 | So we do not predict having those areas be expanded out would be more walkable in the future.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=587.0)  |
|     594 |   598 | So this would be exempted from those standards.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=594.0)  |
|     599 |   602 | If I may interrupt, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=599.0)  |
|     602 |   603 | Go ahead.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=602.0)  |
|     603 |   611 | Council Member Thomas, what Jeff is presenting is what was brought before you the latter part of last year                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=603.0)  |
|     611 |   614 | and what was approved by the Planning Commission, what we would like to do.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=611.0)  |
|     614 |   619 | And at that time it was basically a one-size-fits-all for these particular areas.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=614.0)  |
|     621 |   629 | With your patience with me, what we'd like to do is show examples of this and then we have a recommendation that builds on that,                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=621.0)  |
|     629 |   633 | but it's not just a one-size-fits-all, if that's all right.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=629.0)  |
|     634 |   635 | That's fine. Thank you.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=634.0)  |
|     637 |   638 | Council Member Ryder.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=637.0)  |
|     638 |   644 | Well, so maybe I need to see what Mr. Cannon is planning to present because                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=638.0)  |
|     646 |   654 | when you talk about Broadway north of Ridgewood, I feel like there are parts of Broadway                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=646.0)  |
|     655 |   664 | immediately, maybe even parts of Broadway immediately south of 640 and there are parts of Broadway that are north of 640.                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=655.0)  |
|     666 |   673 | I think the parts of Broadway that abut, or the parcels that abut Broadway where Hotel is,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=666.0)  |
|     674 |   683 | like where the park is, are slightly different in their layout, walkability, that type of thing.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=674.0)  |
|     685 |   693 | So making this cutoff at Ridgewood seems like it doesn't meet some of the differentials that we have on Broadway.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=685.0)  |
|     696 |   697 | We agree.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=696.0)  |
|     697 |   698 | Am I making sense?                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=697.0)  |
|     698 |   699 | You're making sense.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=698.0)  |
|     699 |   700 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=699.0)  |
|     700 |   706 | And I think our recommendation is an attempt, and you all can guide us where you would like to go,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=700.0)  |
|     706 |   712 | but we're going to take it to another level to help address those areas, ma'am.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=706.0)  |
|     715 |   716 | Council Member Thomas.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=715.0)  |
|     720 |   729 | Mr. Welch, while we're talking about the district, in the CG district, all of the uses are the same, is that correct?                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=720.0)  |
|     729 |   730 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=729.0)  |
|     730 |   734 | So all we're really talking about, we're not talking about a variety of different uses,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=730.0)  |
|     734 |   741 | we're talking about, I guess, the build-to zone, the build-to percentage would be different,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=734.0)  |
|     741 |   743 | but then also the height of the buildings.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=741.0)  |
|     743 |   745 | Is that correct?                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=743.0)  |
|     745 |   747 | The height would be yes.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=745.0)  |
|     747 |   748 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=747.0)  |
|     748 |   749 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=748.0)  |
|     749 |   752 | And it is, I'm sorry, go ahead.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=749.0)  |
|     752 |   753 | No, no, you go ahead.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=752.0)  |
|     753 |   754 | I'm fine.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=753.0)  |
|     754 |   755 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=754.0)  |
|     755 |   763 | But in each of these, what we've done with these zones is we're encouraging the ability to do a mixed-use development.                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=755.0)  |
|     763 |   764 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=763.0)  |
|     764 |   770 | And what we're really talking about is that for the largest part of the city,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=764.0)  |
|     770 |   781 | which we see is not highlighted with the kind of bold line on those arterials, that whole area is considered more walkable.                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=770.0)  |
|     781 |   790 | And as you get further away from city center where traffic is more oriented toward vehicles as opposed to pedestrian,                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=781.0)  |
|     790 |   799 | what I got from your discussion was that in those areas it is not friendly to pedestrian traffic,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=790.0)  |
|     799 |   802 | nor do you expect it to be any time soon.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=799.0)  |
|     802 |   807 | In most of those corridors, you begin to see as you go further west, northeast, or south,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=802.0)  |
|     807 |   813 | that you see the massive parking lots in front of the food city or the Kmart,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=807.0)  |
|     813 |   819 | or abandoned Kmart or Westtown Mall where, you know, it's just not a great place to walk                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=813.0)  |
|     819 |   822 | and you're further distanced from any of the developments.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=819.0)  |
|     822 |   828 | We just don't see that redeveloping as quickly as we would hope to see in these other corridors closer to the inner city                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=822.0)  |
|     828 |   834 | where we are seeing continued redevelopment out of the central core, you know, central city.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=828.0)  |
|     834 |   839 | As you see with Cumberland Avenue, you know, that is being developed, you know,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=834.0)  |
|     839 |   842 | redeveloped significantly over the last five years.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=839.0)  |
|     842 |   848 | So we can see that this will continue to out these corridors.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=842.0)  |
|     848 |   849 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=848.0)  |
|     849 |   856 | Now, along these same areas that we're talking about in the bold, those are controlled by TDOT, is that correct?                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=849.0)  |
|     856 |   857 | All these highways are.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=856.0)  |
|     857 |   862 | Access is controlled by TDOT and, you know, City of Knoxville in cooperation with TDOT,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=857.0)  |
|     862 |   869 | but they have their access policies that are quite stringent and you can seek exceptions,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=862.0)  |
|     869 |   874 | but those exceptions are very difficult and time-consuming to pursue.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=869.0)  |
|     874 |   879 | And just from my looking, and I just wanted your thoughts on this too,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=874.0)  |
|     879 |   887 | a lot of the lots that are in, you know, these areas that we're highlighting, they're not exactly larger lots.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=879.0)  |
|     887 |   888 | They're more smaller.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=887.0)  |
|     888 |   889 | That's true.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=888.0)  |
|     889 |   891 | Closer to the inner city, yes.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=889.0)  |
|     891 |   902 | So you've got, if you've got limited frontage in a smaller, you know, area that you're working with and TDOT,                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=891.0)  |
|     902 |   906 | I think you have to get their permission not only from the city for your permit,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=902.0)  |
|     906 |   910 | but you also get permission from TDOT as well.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=906.0)  |
|     910 |   917 | Can you find yourself in a position where you can't, you know, do what you're wanting to do                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=910.0)  |
|     917 |   924 | because you're going to have a curb cut that is going to be mandated to you where it's going to go?                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=917.0)  |
|     924 |   926 | Can that be a challenge?                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=924.0)  |
|     926 |   927 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=926.0)  |
|     927 |   931 | Obviously it is a challenge just to meet their standards, particular TDOT standards,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=927.0)  |
|     931 |   937 | because their standards fit across this entire state, whether you're, you know, a Memphis or a Knoxville,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=931.0)  |
|     937 |   938 | it's the same standards.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=937.0)  |
|     938 |   939 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=938.0)  |
|     939 |   940 | All right.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=939.0)  |
|     940 |   941 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=940.0)  |
|     941 |   942 | I thought I saw another.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=941.0)  |
|     942 |   943 | All right.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=942.0)  |
|     943 |   944 | Council Member Thomas.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=943.0)  |
|     944 |   945 | Yes, just for clarity.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=944.0)  |
|     945 |   948 | The entire length of Broadway is under TDOT's control.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=945.0)  |
|     948 |   953 | The entire length of Broadway, Hall of Fame, Broadway is entire TDOT?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=948.0)  |
|     953 |   955 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=953.0)  |
|     955 |   961 | Well, I should say Broadway when you, not Broadway here from Fifth Avenue,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=955.0)  |
|     961 |   969 | but up to where it converts over to Hall of Fame, that is TDOT's control.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=961.0)  |
|     969 |   980 | So Broadway through the Fourth and Gill area down to basically down to Henley Street there is not TDOT controlled.                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=969.0)  |
|     980 |   985 | So it's state controlled, then it connects to Hall of Fame Drive.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=980.0)  |
|     985 |   990 | So that Broadway through the Fourth and Gill area and Old North Knot is not TDOT right away.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=985.0)  |
|     990 |   991 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=990.0)  |
|     991 |   996 | But, Mr. Welch, all of the areas you've got highlighted in the bold there that we're talking about, the exemption,                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=991.0)  |
|     996 |   998 | those are all TDOT controlled?                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=996.0)  |
|     998 |   999 | Those are, yes.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=998.0)  |
|     999 |  1002 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=999.0)  |

|    1006 |  1014 | I'll just point out in looking at the map, a large portion of that Asheville Highway section is also zone commercial highway.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1006.0) |
|    1014 |  1016 | Big chunks of it are.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1014.0) |
|    1016 |  1017 | It's a mix.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1016.0) |
|    1017 |  1018 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1017.0) |

|    1021 |  1022 | All right.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1021.0) |
|    1022 |  1024 | Move on to the next section.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1022.0) |

|    1026 |  1033 | At this point, we'll go through some examples that are kind of representative of CG across these corridors,                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1026.0) |
|    1033 |  1038 | and this is development that's taking place or already has taken place.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1033.0) |
|    1038 |  1045 | So the first one we'll start out with here is an example of where the property owner rezoned.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1038.0) |
|    1045 |  1050 | This is on Kingston Pike right here where the red star is.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1045.0) |
|    1050 |  1055 | It's 8000, 8004 Kingston Pike.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1050.0) |
|    1055 |  1061 | You can see now that this location would be excluded and fall within the excluded corridor,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1055.0) |
|    1061 |  1067 | but currently it is a Scooter's Coffee and a Take 5 oil change.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1061.0) |
|    1067 |  1075 | What we had here was the applicant requested a rezoning from CG3 back in 2020.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1067.0) |
|    1075 |  1082 | Planning staff reported the applicant sought a rezone due to the restrictive setback requirements in the CG3.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1075.0) |
|    1082 |  1091 | The 2021 commission denied the request, and council approved it in February of 2021.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1082.0) |
|    1091 |  1096 | So here this is along a major arterial that Jeff was referencing earlier.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1091.0) |
|    1096 |  1100 | It's a four-lane section of Kingston Pike with a center turn lane.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1096.0) |
|    1100 |  1103 | We've got the Take 5 oil, Scooter's Coffee right here.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1100.0) |
|    1103 |  1108 | It's just west of West Town Mall.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1103.0) |
|    1108 |  1113 | So the next one we'll look at is the star right down here on Chapman Highway.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1108.0) |
|    1113 |  1118 | These are a couple examples of where the Bill 2 zones requirements were met.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1113.0) |
|    1118 |  1122 | This first one is at 4103 Chapman Highway.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1118.0) |
|    1122 |  1127 | This parcel is zone CG2, and it requires a Bill 2 zone of zero to 20 feet,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1122.0) |
|    1127 |  1134 | so the front of the building has to be within zero to 20 feet off of Chapman Highway,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1127.0) |
|    1134 |  1138 | and 50 percent of the front of that building has to be within that Bill 2 zone.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1134.0) |
|    1138 |  1144 | So this is currently a fast-paced health, and they met the Bill 2 zone requirements.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1138.0) |
|    1144 |  1147 | You can see here this is from their site plan.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1144.0) |

|    1158 |  1165 | This, again, is a major arterial, this section of Chapman Highway, four-lane with a center turn lane.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1158.0) |
|    1165 |  1172 | It's just south of Moody Avenue.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1165.0) |
|    1172 |  1179 | And the next example is another one that met the requirement of the Bill 2 zone.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1172.0) |

|    1181 |  1184 | This is 2520 Sutherland Avenue.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1181.0) |
|    1184 |  1191 | This parcel is zone CG2, another Bill 2 zone requirement of zero to 20 feet off of Sutherland,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1184.0) |
|    1191 |  1197 | as well as a Bill 2 zone requirement on the corner side of Emmett Street.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1191.0) |
|    1197 |  1202 | This is downtown dental, and they met the Bill 2 zone requirements.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1197.0) |
|    1202 |  1208 | This is located across from Young-Williams Animal Center.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1202.0) |
|    1208 |  1210 | Here's their site plan.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1208.0) |
|    1210 |  1219 | You can see by the red dashed line, here's the Bill 2 zone off of Sutherland, this area right here.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1210.0) |
|    1219 |  1225 | And so they located the front of their building within that Bill 2 zone requirement,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1219.0) |

|    1237 |  1241 | Here's an image of it at the corner of Sutherland and Emmett.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1237.0) |
|    1241 |  1244 | You can see how it fronts along those properties.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1241.0) |

|    1250 |  1257 | The last example is a property that is currently seeking a variance to the Bill 2 zone requirement.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1250.0) |
|    1257 |  1261 | This one is at 2900 Broadway.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1257.0) |

|    1264 |  1266 | It's zone CG2.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1264.0) |
|    1266 |  1273 | It has a Bill 2 zone of 0 to 10 feet.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1266.0) |
|    1273 |  1277 | And this is a corner side that they're trying to vary.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1273.0) |
|    1277 |  1283 | So 30% of this corner side from 0 to 10 feet of the building is supposed to be within that.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1277.0) |
|    1283 |  1289 | And so they are requesting a variance and going to the Board of Zoning Appeals in May.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1283.0) |
|    1289 |  1292 | And here is their site plan.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1289.0) |

|    1297 |  1306 | I'm sorry, excuse me, the Bill 2 zone requirement in relation to where the building should be located based on the code.                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1297.0) |

|    1330 |  1332 | I had a question from Council Member Ryder.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1330.0) |
|    1332 |  1334 | Well, I think you might have hit it.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1332.0) |
|    1334 |  1341 | If there are variances, you just mentioned the last one at the Old First Tennessee building that it's in process for a variance.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1334.0) |
|    1341 |  1344 | The ones like the downtown dental, as you're going through them,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1341.0) |
|    1344 |  1349 | do you have notes on whether they got any variances, the ones that you're going through?                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1344.0) |
|    1349 |  1355 | Like Scooter's Coffee, 5-Minute Oil, did they get any variances?                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1349.0) |
|    1355 |  1357 | From my recollection, I don't think they did.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1355.0) |
|    1357 |  1363 | No, Scooter's Coffee, they got rezoned so that they would not need variances.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1357.0) |
|    1363 |  1364 | Okay, that was my question.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1363.0) |
|    1364 |  1373 | The other two met the Bill 2 zone requirements, so the downtown dental.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1364.0) |
|    1373 |  1375 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1373.0) |
|    1376 |  1382 | If you'll bear with an engineer speaking planning, and I'll probably flub this up,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1376.0) |
|    1382 |  1387 | we've come up with what we believe makes sense moving forward.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1382.0) |
|    1387 |  1396 | I will tell you that shortly after Council directed us to get with planning and revisit this, we spent a fair amount of time.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1387.0) |
|    1396 |  1398 | Chris Halley was involved in this.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1396.0) |
|    1398 |  1404 | This is where the development site plans come through.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1398.0) |
|    1404 |  1413 | We looked at places like downtown west, which has a significant area of the CG2, CG3 zoning,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1404.0) |
|    1413 |  1421 | and as we discussed it, we realized that any solution was going to take a while to arrive at.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1413.0) |
|    1421 |  1422 | We talked about overlays.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1421.0) |
|    1422 |  1425 | We talked about new zones.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1422.0) |
|    1425 |  1435 | We went through the whole laundry list, and it is going to take some extra effort to come up with that right answer.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1425.0) |
|    1435 |  1441 | Quite frankly, we believe it's going to take a fair amount of public input and public input from you all.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1435.0) |
|    1441 |  1444 | You all know your districts best.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1441.0) |
|    1444 |  1446 | We need your help in that arena.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1444.0) |
|    1446 |  1452 | All said, the first step that the Planning Commission approved and recommended,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1446.0) |
|    1452 |  1456 | we believe that's the right first step to get us started.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1452.0) |
|    1456 |  1462 | And then this fall, we're coming up on the summer months.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1456.0) |
|    1462 |  1469 | Not everybody is going to be here, and we felt like it would be a disservice to dive into this in earnest during the summer.                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1462.0) |
|    1469 |  1480 | So what we're talking about is revisiting CG2 and CG3 districts on a community-by-community basis beginning early fall                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1469.0) |
|    1480 |  1489 | to see what solutions we can come up with for planning to take to its commission and bring before you all.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1480.0) |
|    1489 |  1495 | The constraints are pretty simple, and that is these are state routes.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1489.0) |
|    1495 |  1503 | And where you see the shaded areas, this is where engineering-speak may not be exactly planning-speak, so forgive me.                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1495.0) |
|    1503 |  1512 | I would respectfully offer that as we come into the core of our city, that is urban development, and that has worked well.                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1503.0) |
|    1512 |  1516 | What we have in our zoning ordinance is working well.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1512.0) |
|    1516 |  1524 | It's where we have these transitions to what I would call suburban, what has been traditionally suburban,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1516.0) |
|    1524 |  1531 | that we're struggling with the pedestrian aspect of these zones being implemented in full.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1524.0) |
|    1531 |  1535 | That's why we're seeing variances. That's why we're seeing rezoning.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1531.0) |
|    1535 |  1545 | And one of the things that we want to do is to address this in such a way to where we don't have a number of variances or a number of rezonings.  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1535.0) |
|    1545 |  1548 | We've mentioned TDOT, their access control.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1545.0) |
|    1548 |  1555 | The encouraging news is that TDOT is sensitive to the pedestrian efforts as well.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1548.0) |
|    1555 |  1558 | We don't have to look much further than Chapman Highway.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1555.0) |
|    1558 |  1564 | The concept plans that TDOT has recently completed to see that they're broadening their vision                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1558.0) |
|    1564 |  1569 | and that it's more than just moving cars back and forth down their highways.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1564.0) |
|    1569 |  1573 | They're looking at multimodal, including bikes, including pedestrians.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1569.0) |
|    1573 |  1583 | A lot of words on my part to say that we believe it is appropriate for planning to re-recommend,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1573.0) |
|    1583 |  1587 | for lack of a better term, what they brought before you in November,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1583.0) |

|    1593 |  1599 | where this may be an issue and see what is the best solution.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1593.0) |
|    1599 |  1604 | It may very well be that it's not a one-size-fits-all.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1599.0) |
|    1604 |  1607 | There was one other point I wanted to make.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1604.0) |
|    1607 |  1610 | Actually, I want Mr. Ahrens to make regarding CG.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1607.0) |
|    1610 |  1612 | This has to do with CG1.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1610.0) |
|    1612 |  1617 | We know that there has been significant discussion by council on design guidelines,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1612.0) |
|    1617 |  1622 | and I'm going to let Peter address that with your permission, Vice Mayor.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1617.0) |
|    1622 |  1626 | Please do.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1622.0) |
|    1626 |  1631 | Thank you, Harold.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1626.0) |
|    1631 |  1638 | I think the issue with the CG1, as I've understood it from council and neighborhoods,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1631.0) |
|    1638 |  1644 | is we don't want bad design in our corridors, in our CG1.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1638.0) |
|    1644 |  1652 | We don't want to have buildings with blank walls that you drive by every day.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1644.0) |
|    1652 |  1663 | I think it definitely warrants investigation to look into what sort of options are out there.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1652.0) |
|    1663 |  1669 | I personally hate to jump right into design guidelines because, as we discussed,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1663.0) |
|    1669 |  1673 | not every building is a pedestrian building.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1669.0) |
|    1673 |  1679 | You've got your drive-through coffee.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1673.0) |
|    1679 |  1682 | Sometimes design guidelines don't fit for everything,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1679.0) |
|    1682 |  1688 | so I think that it is something that we need to look into where there are standards that need to be met                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1682.0) |
|    1688 |  1699 | but with enough flexibility that we're not shoving every round peg through a square hole or vice versa.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1688.0) |
|    1699 |  1706 | And I appreciate you bringing that up because council has brought up the design standards in CG1 as well,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1699.0) |
|    1706 |  1714 | and I think the reason is that we had been seeing several examples of requests for rezoning                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1706.0) |
|    1714 |  1722 | because the development wouldn't be able to be brought up to the street,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1714.0) |
|    1722 |  1727 | and given the size of it and I think all the challenges we talked about before.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1722.0) |
|    1727 |  1729 | And I understand the flexibility.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1727.0) |
|    1729 |  1733 | In fact, I think the discussion tonight is primarily about flexibility.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1729.0) |
|    1733 |  1742 | We're talking about having flexibility in areas that are not going to be pedestrian-oriented,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1733.0) |
|    1742 |  1746 | as Mr. Welch said, very soon, if ever,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1742.0) |
|    1746 |  1757 | and then making sure that we enhance that pedestrian-friendly area more in Center City where we can have that happen.                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1746.0) |
|    1757 |  1766 | I guess my fear with not having design standards at all in CG1 is once something goes up, it's there,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1757.0) |
|    1766 |  1769 | and it's going to be there for a while.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1766.0) |
|    1769 |  1778 | So I would agree with Mr. Ahrens that there probably is some level of flexibility that we could provide                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1769.0) |
|    1778 |  1789 | with also making sure there's some protections that, you know, anything goes is not going to be the rule.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1778.0) |
|    1789 |  1792 | Mr. Boxborough, that concludes our presentation.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1789.0) |
|    1792 |  1796 | That's the last slide, so we're open for questions.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1792.0) |
|    1796 |  1798 | Then I'm going to volley it their way because I know what they're doing.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1796.0) |
|    1798 |  1799 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1798.0) |
|    1799 |  1800 | Council Member Smith.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1799.0) |
|    1800 |  1801 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1800.0) |
|    1801 |  1802 | I've got a handful of questions.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1801.0) |
|    1802 |  1806 | I guess whoever feels bravest can take it for the gang of four.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1802.0) |
|    1806 |  1811 | Sorry, greatest gang of five.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1806.0) |
|    1811 |  1817 | In the first slide of our presentation, there's a public stakeholder committee.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1811.0) |
|    1817 |  1820 | Maybe blanking, but who is that?                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1817.0) |
|    1820 |  1825 | That was the stakeholder committee that advised the recode process,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1820.0) |
|    1825 |  1830 | and they met for about a year after the adoption of the new zoning ordinance,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1825.0) |
|    1830 |  1837 | so they continue to have discussions on certain issues related to the new code.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1830.0) |
|    1837 |  1843 | So that's they sort of sunset at about a year, if I'm not mistaken, about a year after.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1837.0) |
|    1843 |  1844 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1843.0) |
|    1844 |  1853 | Has there been any other public input outside of that committee or planning commission meetings?                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1844.0) |
|    1853 |  1857 | Not that I'm aware of, Council Member Smith, not that I'm aware of.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1853.0) |
|    1857 |  1860 | Then two or three more.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1857.0) |
|    1860 |  1865 | On your recommendations, I think you recommended we approve planning commission's recommendation                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1860.0) |
|    1865 |  1872 | and then go area by area for public input.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1865.0) |
|    1872 |  1873 | Did I mishear that?                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1872.0) |
|    1873 |  1874 | No, sir.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1873.0) |
|    1874 |  1878 | We believe that I believe it will have to go back to planning commission                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1874.0) |
|    1878 |  1881 | and then be sent back to council.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1878.0) |
|    1881 |  1884 | We believe areas that were highlighted on the map,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1881.0) |
|    1884 |  1892 | those are reasonable limitations for some of these changes for now.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1884.0) |
|    1892 |  1896 | And then we're talking just a very few months,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1892.0) |
|    1896 |  1901 | and then the public process that you mentioned, we would open the door to that                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1896.0) |
|    1901 |  1903 | to see how we need to refine this.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1901.0) |
|    1903 |  1905 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1903.0) |
|    1905 |  1910 | It seemed like maybe I missed this, but it seemed like some of the examples that you gave,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1905.0) |
|    1910 |  1914 | which I thank you for doing that, were some that required rezoning,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1910.0) |
|    1914 |  1918 | some that required variances, and some that worked according to the code.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1914.0) |
|    1918 |  1919 | Is that right?                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1918.0) |
|    1919 |  1921 | All of those options were in there?                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1919.0) |
|    1921 |  1922 | That's correct.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1921.0) |
|    1922 |  1923 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1922.0) |
|    1923 |  1937 | And how would you describe why some worked and some didn't?                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1923.0) |
|    1938 |  1940 | I'll jump in here.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1938.0) |
|    1940 |  1946 | Those that met, like the, was that a medical clinic?                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1940.0) |
|    1946 |  1947 | Yeah, fast pace.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1946.0) |
|    1947 |  1948 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1947.0) |
|    1948 |  1953 | Those are not strictly an auto-oriented business model                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1948.0) |
|    1953 |  1958 | versus auto-oriented take five or drive-through.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1953.0) |
|    1958 |  1961 | So in conjunction to the zoning code,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1958.0) |
|    1961 |  1969 | the actual business use in their business model comes into play a lot.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1961.0) |
|    1969 |  1970 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1969.0) |
|    1970 |  1977 | I think that's the predominant reason why there was the request for the rezonings and variances.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1970.0) |
|    1977 |  1978 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1977.0) |
|    1978 |  1979 | That's super helpful.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1978.0) |
|    1979 |  1986 | And along those lines, we talked a little bit in the beginning about pedestrian safety                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1979.0) |
|    1986 |  1988 | as the primary driver of this,                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1986.0) |
|    1988 |  1995 | but it seems like developing old properties is the thing that's not working.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1988.0) |
|    1995 |  1999 | In other words, I don't hear people coming up to me and say,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1995.0) |
|    1999 |  2005 | I sure can't walk as good on Chapman Highway because the building's 10 feet more back                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=1999.0) |
|    2005 |  2007 | versus fast pace is up here.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2005.0) |
|    2007 |  2013 | I don't hear people saying this would change or increase their likelihood                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2007.0) |

|    2017 |  2023 | So just objectively, this seems like a development challenge                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2017.0) |
|    2023 |  2029 | more than it is a pedestrian safety outcry that we've heard.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2023.0) |
|    2029 |  2036 | I understand the connection between the two, obviously, but am I wrong in that?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2029.0) |
|    2036 |  2039 | I'm not sure if you've not heard the outcry or not,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2036.0) |

|    2049 |  2056 | it tends to slow traffic down and tends to make it more comfortable to walk.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2049.0) |
|    2056 |  2061 | That is what you're trying to encourage in that respect.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2056.0) |
|    2061 |  2065 | So that, again, was part of the purpose of CG2 and CG3,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2061.0) |
|    2066 |  2070 | put the buildings closer to the street front and have activity on the street                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2066.0) |
|    2070 |  2075 | or on the sidewalks versus 100 feet or 30 feet off the corridor.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2070.0) |
|    2075 |  2077 | So in other words, in these highlighted parts of the corridors,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2075.0) |
|    2077 |  2079 | there would be less encouragement of that.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2077.0) |
|    2079 |  2082 | Yes, because the built environment is already significant there                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2079.0) |
|    2082 |  2085 | with shopping centers and that and larger lots.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2082.0) |
|    2085 |  2089 | And on the one on Chapman Highway that you have up there,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2085.0) |
|    2090 |  2099 | that would not have happened if we would approve this removal or addition of Section C.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2090.0) |
|    2099 |  2101 | Is that right?                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2099.0) |
|    2101 |  2105 | No, this would still be in the required Bill 2 zone area.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2101.0) |
|    2105 |  2110 | That star is located right there, so it's just outside of it.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2105.0) |
|    2110 |  2111 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2110.0) |
|    2111 |  2114 | And last question, then I'll be quiet.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2111.0) |
|    2114 |  2120 | What determines where the star is?                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2114.0) |
|    2120 |  2123 | Well, the star is the location of that particular area.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2120.0) |
|    2123 |  2128 | Why did you start at Young High Pike and not another street?                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2123.0) |
|    2128 |  2134 | We looked at the various land uses and the character of the corridors                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2128.0) |
|    2134 |  2140 | and had to make a judgment of where we felt it was best to begin it.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2134.0) |
|    2140 |  2143 | There was debate on the planning commission for Chapman Highway                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2140.0) |
|    2143 |  2146 | as well as Kingston Pike of where it should begin.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2143.0) |
|    2146 |  2150 | Some folks wanted it a little bit further to the south on Chapman Highway.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2146.0) |
|    2150 |  2154 | And then Kingston Pike, there was comments about extending it a little bit                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2150.0) |
|    2154 |  2158 | all the way to North Shore Drive, but they pulled it back to Bearden.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2154.0) |
|    2158 |  2162 | A block or two or 1,000 feet were sort of some of the debate.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2158.0) |
|    2162 |  2167 | Chapman Highway was, again, there was an interest on that.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2162.0) |
|    2167 |  2170 | But in the end, this is what the commission did.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2167.0) |
|    2170 |  2174 | The commission did modify staff's recommendation a bit on Kingston Pike,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2170.0) |
|    2174 |  2176 | but they did not on Chapman Highway.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2174.0) |
|    2176 |  2179 | Mr. Berry, let me clarify the question I just asked.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2176.0) |
|    2179 |  2185 | Fast pace would not have been possible in the shaded area if we accept Section C.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2179.0) |
|    2185 |  2189 | Is that correct?                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2185.0) |
|    2189 |  2199 | The build to distance for fast pace would not be required if we accept this proposal.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2189.0) |
|    2199 |  2200 | Is that right?                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2199.0) |
|    2200 |  2202 | In the shaded area?                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2200.0) |
|    2202 |  2205 | If it were past Moody, this would not be the case?                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2202.0) |
|    2205 |  2206 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2205.0) |
|    2206 |  2208 | If you're saying they could have set the building further back?                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2206.0) |
|    2208 |  2209 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2208.0) |
|    2209 |  2210 | Yes, they would have been able to do that.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2209.0) |
|    2210 |  2213 | Further south of Moody, outside of the current range?                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2210.0) |

|    2216 |  2218 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2216.0) |
|    2218 |  2220 | Council Member Ryder.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2218.0) |
|    2220 |  2222 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2220.0) |
|    2222 |  2226 | So, a couple of things.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2222.0) |
|    2226 |  2232 | Number one, Councilman Smith asked specifically about some of the examples.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2226.0) |
|    2232 |  2236 | I will specifically say the downtown dental location is on Sutherland,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2232.0) |
|    2236 |  2240 | which is a very walkable two-lane road.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2236.0) |
|    2240 |  2246 | I pass that every day on the way to work and the way leaving work.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2240.0) |
|    2246 |  2252 | I pass it twice a day, and that's a very walkable route.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2246.0) |
|    2252 |  2258 | And so it makes a lot of sense to have a building that addresses the road in that kind of area, or new buildings.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2252.0) |
|    2258 |  2260 | Are people walking to the dentist?                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2258.0) |
|    2260 |  2264 | Maybe, maybe not.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2260.0) |
|    2264 |  2271 | And then what I will say about walkability and the outcry, just to kind of comment on that, of people,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2264.0) |
|    2271 |  2277 | just kind of, I know some people don't know my district as well as others, so we all know our own areas,                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2271.0) |
|    2277 |  2283 | but close your eyes and envision yourself in one of the neighborhoods off-Broadway.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2277.0) |
|    2283 |  2290 | We are close-knit houses, 50-foot wide lots for the majority, right?                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2283.0) |
|    2290 |  2296 | So the other night I parked on Chicago at my friend's house, and we walked to La Piñata,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2290.0) |
|    2296 |  2299 | a Mexican restaurant that addresses the street.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2296.0) |
|    2299 |  2305 | So we walk on sidewalk, sidewalk, sidewalk, and we walk into La Piñata, and we dine, and we walk away.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2299.0) |
|    2305 |  2312 | We don't have to walk through a parking lot to get to the door of the restaurant.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2305.0) |
|    2312 |  2319 | But if I wanted to walk from her house, or my house even, to go to Kroger,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2312.0) |
|    2319 |  2322 | and actually that's a really great example.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2319.0) |
|    2322 |  2327 | Many of those neighbors, like Broadway Towers, is a community where a lot of people don't have cars.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2322.0) |
|    2328 |  2335 | They have to walk across Broadway, and then they have to walk through a sea of parking spaces                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2328.0) |
|    2335 |  2340 | that are oriented towards cars with no sidewalks to go shop at the Kroger.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2335.0) |
|    2340 |  2342 | And that kind of sucks.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2340.0) |
|    2342 |  2346 | I mean, you have to play Frogger to leave with your groceries.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2342.0) |
|    2346 |  2349 | So that was what the zoning code changes were about,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2346.0) |
|    2349 |  2354 | was so that in areas and communities where you have dense housing and you could walk,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2349.0) |
|    2354 |  2360 | that you can literally go into the building without having to go through a sea of parking.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2354.0) |
|    2360 |  2366 | So when we make these changes, I think we just have to think about the different pockets.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2360.0) |
|    2366 |  2369 | Okay, so Mr. Cannon.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2366.0) |
|    2369 |  2374 | So what we're looking at is we had a proposal, which is the Section C,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2369.0) |
|    2374 |  2380 | and somebody jump in and correct me when I get wrong.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2374.0) |
|    2380 |  2383 | We had something that came to council agenda.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2380.0) |
|    2383 |  2390 | We rejected it and said we wanted to talk about this some more, and we scheduled this workshop.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2383.0) |
|    2390 |  2397 | And now it's will you guys just approve this so we have a temp fix so we can come back                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2390.0) |
|    2397 |  2399 | and fix it in the fall when it's not summer.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2397.0) |
|    2399 |  2402 | Is that what I heard you say?                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2399.0) |
|    2402 |  2403 | Yes, ma'am.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2402.0) |
|    2403 |  2405 | Let me add one condition to that, if you don't mind.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2403.0) |
|    2405 |  2406 | Yes, sir.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2405.0) |
|    2406 |  2412 | Can you go to the map, please?                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2406.0) |
|    2412 |  2419 | I believe Planning Commission staff is to follow the recommendations that you saw on the last slide.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2412.0) |
|    2419 |  2425 | Here's the opportunity that you have for each of your districts.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2419.0) |
|    2425 |  2433 | The staff helped draw the limits on where these shaded areas are.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2425.0) |
|    2433 |  2440 | From today on, what goes to the Planning Commission, if you want to see that changed,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2433.0) |
|    2441 |  2445 | you can put that request into staff and make that change.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2441.0) |
|    2445 |  2447 | Or if they didn't change anything.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2445.0) |
|    2447 |  2449 | You're talking about where the shaded areas are?                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2447.0) |
|    2449 |  2451 | Where the shaded areas, if you wanted.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2449.0) |
|    2451 |  2452 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2451.0) |
|    2452 |  2456 | Because this is being revisited by the Planning Commission in total.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2452.0) |
|    2456 |  2457 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2456.0) |
|    2457 |  2462 | So if you wanted that line, I'll use the star on Chapman for just a minute.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2457.0) |
|    2462 |  2471 | Councilman Smith, if you and your constituents believe that needs to be further south, pick another road,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2462.0) |
|    2471 |  2473 | then that can be presented that way.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2471.0) |
|    2473 |  2481 | Or even if it doesn't come to you that way, this body has the right, I believe, Vice Mayor,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2473.0) |
|    2481 |  2487 | and please correct me if I'm wrong, to make adjustments to those recommendations.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2481.0) |
|    2487 |  2497 | I think what you're saying, Mr. Cannon, is in implementing what planning is proposing,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2487.0) |
|    2497 |  2500 | we're acknowledging that there's a problem.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2497.0) |
|    2500 |  2501 | Yes, sir.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2500.0) |
|    2501 |  2505 | Which I think all of you are telling us is a problem.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2501.0) |
|    2505 |  2513 | And then the quick piece to this is the adoption of what was presented to us back in November,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2505.0) |
|    2513 |  2523 | and that begins a discussion citywide and certainly in our districts about where this line should be.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2513.0) |
|    2523 |  2525 | And so that's where we're looking for public input.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2523.0) |
|    2525 |  2528 | Is that maybe a better, finer point on it?                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2525.0) |
|    2528 |  2529 | Yes, sir.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2528.0) |
|    2529 |  2535 | The only exception I was offering is that this will be a new matter going back to Planning Commission,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2529.0) |
|    2535 |  2543 | and you have the chance to make some tweaks, if you will, if you feel that that should have been done.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2535.0) |
|    2543 |  2545 | My time is up.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2543.0) |
|    2545 |  2547 | I'm going to turn it off and I'm going to turn it right back on.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2545.0) |
|    2547 |  2549 | That's good.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2547.0) |
|    2549 |  2551 | Council Member Fugate.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2549.0) |
|    2551 |  2552 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2551.0) |
|    2552 |  2557 | So, Mr. Cannon, I think you clarified what I was going to say.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2552.0) |
|    2557 |  2564 | It sounds to me like at this point if any district reps or an at-large person disagrees with some of this,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2557.0) |
|    2564 |  2571 | we, with where that exemption place starts, we could say to planning staff,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2564.0) |
|    2571 |  2574 | we think the road ought to be a certain way.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2571.0) |
|    2574 |  2577 | Then that can be debated by the Planning Commission,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2574.0) |
|    2577 |  2585 | and then if they agree with the esteemed colleagues I have who know their district better probably than the Planning Commissioners do,            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2577.0) |
|    2585 |  2589 | then if that's accepted, whatever.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2585.0) |
|    2589 |  2594 | But I will say in all this discussion, because I sit in an at-large seat,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2589.0) |
|    2594 |  2602 | I mean, there's a real tension here because there's some places that just aren't going to be walkable.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2594.0) |
|    2602 |  2607 | I mean, because they're not going to be walkable because we can't build sidewalks                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2602.0) |
|    2607 |  2617 | because we have I don't know how many billions of dollars of sidewalk projects ahead that actually are in neighborhoods.                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2607.0) |
|    2617 |  2626 | So I think that is a real factor in how realistic we can take a look at this.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2617.0) |
|    2626 |  2628 | Somebody mentioned downtown west.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2626.0) |
|    2628 |  2630 | My office is out there.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2628.0) |
|    2630 |  2632 | I wouldn't walk.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2630.0) |
|    2632 |  2633 | I mean, there are a few sidewalks.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2632.0) |
|    2633 |  2643 | I mean, I could take a dead run out of downtown west across downtown west boulevard to get to Ramirez and go to Target,                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2633.0) |
|    2643 |  2647 | and some people do, but that's about all you walk.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2643.0) |
|    2647 |  2650 | You don't see people on Kingston Pike walking.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2647.0) |
|    2650 |  2656 | And I also think the other thing we have to be mindful of is with some of this,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2650.0) |
|    2656 |  2663 | we will absolutely preclude certain types of businesses, and if that's our intent, we can do that.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2656.0) |
|    2663 |  2670 | But, I mean, what we heard is some variances were asked for because the type of business they were                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2663.0) |
|    2670 |  2676 | could not function with the lot restrictions.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2670.0) |
|    2676 |  2682 | So I think that's also a tough am I correct about that,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2676.0) |
|    2682 |  2693 | that it would make it very difficult for some types of businesses to actually be in CG2 if there's no place that it can be an exemption.          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2682.0) |
|    2693 |  2702 | So if it's a drive-through coffee shop, maybe with the exemption it can go further down the road and be there                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2693.0) |
|    2702 |  2712 | because it would be an exempt area as opposed to having to ask for variances in the non-exempt area with this recommendation.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2702.0) |
|    2712 |  2713 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2712.0) |
|    2713 |  2726 | I mean, I don't have the magic answer, but I would recommend that my colleagues get their request for moving exemption areas in quickly.          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2713.0) |
|    2726 |  2727 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2726.0) |
|    2727 |  2731 | And we did put in sidewalks near Bearden High School.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2727.0) |
|    2731 |  2733 | So there are sidewalks there.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2731.0) |
|    2733 |  2736 | I understand that, but people don't walk on them.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2733.0) |
|    2736 |  2738 | I've seen students walking on them.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2736.0) |
|    2738 |  2742 | I will, but I'm just being realistic that students may walk on them,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2738.0) |
|    2742 |  2752 | but they're not people that live close enough to Kingston Pike by and large because housing isn't quite there closely.                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2742.0) |
|    2752 |  2755 | Yes, they're great for the students that are getting dropped off,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2752.0) |
|    2755 |  2759 | but that's not the majority of who is around there all the time,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2755.0) |
|    2759 |  2764 | and they still drive like bats out of you-know-what coming out of school.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2759.0) |

|    2781 |  2782 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2781.0) |
|    2782 |  2786 | I'm going to talk about part of the issue is how we skin the cat.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2782.0) |
|    2787 |  2788 | I don't know if that's offensive or not.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2787.0) |
|    2788 |  2789 | Sorry.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2788.0) |
|    2789 |  2791 | Maybe not being PC.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2789.0) |

|    2792 |  2795 | We all agree there's a problem, so good news.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2792.0) |
|    2795 |  2800 | We're all on the same page there.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2795.0) |
|    2800 |  2804 | There's the where and the what or the how.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2800.0) |
|    2804 |  2810 | So we've got the conversation about the shaded areas of the parameters of what the exclusions are.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2804.0) |
|    2810 |  2813 | Then let's talk about this whole concept of exclusions,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2810.0) |
|    2813 |  2819 | because I think that's part of the reason we rejected this when it came to council in the first place,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2813.0) |
|    2819 |  2822 | because that's the part I'm not sure I'm sold on.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2819.0) |
|    2822 |  2824 | We can go back and forth.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2822.0) |
|    2824 |  2831 | I mean, I think I gave 75 amendments to recode for parcels in my district,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2824.0) |
|    2831 |  2834 | so I'm happy to go figure out what needs to be where.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2831.0) |
|    2834 |  2836 | I can do that.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2834.0) |
|    2836 |  2840 | But working with my constituents, that was feedback from them.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2836.0) |
|    2840 |  2848 | But the what or the how we address the problem that we all agree that we have is, I think, part of my hang-up.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2840.0) |
|    2848 |  2853 | And so, you know, we're talking about in another previous workshop,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2848.0) |
|    2853 |  2858 | we had a conversation about making some changes to things like accessory dwelling unit                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2853.0) |
|    2858 |  2862 | and basing those changes on not changing the zoning code.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2858.0) |
|    2862 |  2866 | And the reason that we're having to do that and some of the other conversations we're doing there is because                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2862.0) |
|    2866 |  2869 | during recode at the 11th hour, the request was,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2866.0) |
|    2869 |  2876 | we need a different zone because we're trying to apply the same standards to neighborhoods                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2869.0) |
|    2876 |  2879 | that don't have anything to do with any, you know, they don't look the same.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2876.0) |
|    2879 |  2883 | One's a horse and another's a zebra, but we're trying to zone them exactly the same.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2879.0) |
|    2883 |  2885 | And that's what we have here.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2883.0) |
|    2885 |  2888 | We've got horses and zebras up and down these corridors,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2885.0) |
|    2888 |  2893 | but we're trying to give them all the same standards, the same build to, the same this, the same that.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2888.0) |
|    2893 |  2900 | And so now we're going to say, you look at the map and if you have whatever, speckles or spots,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2893.0) |
|    2900 |  2902 | because that's how you guys are going to do this, right?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2900.0) |
|    2902 |  2907 | On the map, it's going to be the places with speckles or spots or shading is going to be treated different                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2902.0) |
|    2907 |  2910 | than the other places, but they're all going to say CG2.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2907.0) |
|    2910 |  2912 | And so let me just go backwards.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2910.0) |
|    2912 |  2919 | You know, we used to have R1, R2, R1A, and that's where you develop other zones.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2912.0) |
|    2919 |  2923 | So my question is going to go back to, is this the right way to skin the cat,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2919.0) |
|    2923 |  2928 | is by putting speckles or spots on certain places and saying they're both CG2.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2923.0) |
|    2928 |  2930 | These CG2s are different.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2928.0) |
|    2930 |  2932 | These CG2s are different here.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2930.0) |
|    2932 |  2937 | I just feel like maybe that's not the right way to approach it, and I question that.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2932.0) |
|    2937 |  2944 | Maybe these areas need to have, you know, their CG4 or CG2A.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2937.0) |
|    2944 |  2951 | I just think it is, I don't know, confusing in a weird way to skin the cat, if that's okay to say.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2944.0) |
|    2951 |  2959 | That was my issue, and I had this conversation with Amy Brooks a long time ago.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2951.0) |
|    2959 |  2962 | We agree, and that's the reason.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2959.0) |
|    2962 |  2964 | Mr. Cannon, you should stop agreeing with me all the time.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2962.0) |
|    2964 |  2967 | We might start to get along, and we'll make some changes.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2964.0) |
|    2967 |  2973 | I didn't think we weren't getting along, but anyway.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2967.0) |
|    2973 |  2976 | That's the reason for the second part of the recommendation,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2973.0) |
|    2976 |  2982 | is that we have tried to look at this from a community basis,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2976.0) |
|    2982 |  2987 | and those shaded areas, I'll call them the outlier areas on those state routes,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2982.0) |
|    2987 |  2997 | seem to be reasonable demarcations for these variances, for lack of a better term,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2987.0) |
|    2997 |  3001 | to be considered, to be applicable.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=2997.0) |
|    3001 |  3005 | Wherever that line needs to be, you're right, and I think I said that in the very beginning.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3001.0) |
|    3005 |  3011 | You know your districts best, and that's where Jeff needs input.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3005.0) |
|    3011 |  3016 | We believe this is the right first step, with this second step following,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3011.0) |
|    3016 |  3020 | to come up with the right way to skin the cat,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3016.0) |
|    3020 |  3027 | and as we debated it amongst ourselves, it became real clear there's a number of ways to tackle this,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3020.0) |
|    3027 |  3032 | and we think that needs your input, we think that needs some public input.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3027.0) |
|    3032 |  3037 | So we're heading exactly where you're proposing,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3032.0) |
|    3037 |  3043 | but also taking into consideration these outlier areas to give them the flexibility                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3037.0) |
|    3043 |  3050 | to basically be consistent with what's happening in that pocket of that community.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3043.0) |
|    3050 |  3055 | Okay, so are you saying you agree that we shouldn't have a bunch of things called CG2,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3050.0) |
|    3055 |  3060 | but they're not all CG2, we're going to have a CG2A?                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3055.0) |
|    3060 |  3063 | I'm saying we need more discussion on that.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3060.0) |
|    3063 |  3070 | We've had discussion on overlay, we've had discussion on exactly what you said, CG2A.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3063.0) |
|    3070 |  3075 | What's the right way to do this so that it's easy for the public                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3070.0) |
|    3075 |  3079 | and for someone who's wanting to buy that lot and develop it,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3075.0) |
|    3079 |  3082 | we want to make it as simple as possible to where they don't have to go through                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3079.0) |
|    3082 |  3088 | a bunch of different overlays or things like that, and is it a CG2A?                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3082.0) |
|    3088 |  3091 | Maybe. It may very well be.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3088.0) |
|    3091 |  3093 | You can call it whatever you want.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3091.0) |
|    3093 |  3095 | I just like the idea of calling it something different.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3093.0) |
|    3095 |  3097 | Yeah, whatever it needs to be called,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3095.0) |
|    3097 |  3100 | and I think that needs to be part of our discussion in this second round, ma'am.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3097.0) |
|    3100 |  3105 | Okay, well, okay, I just want to be clear that that's part of why I rejected it the first time,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3100.0) |
|    3105 |  3107 | and I see Mr. Welch shaking his head yes.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3105.0) |
|    3107 |  3109 | I understand.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3107.0) |
|    3109 |  3114 | We're trying to address something that can be addressed relatively quickly.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3109.0) |
|    3114 |  3117 | We were hoping to address problems that were out there                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3114.0) |
|    3117 |  3122 | without having to open up a can of rezoning,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3117.0) |
|    3122 |  3125 | and, well, if you're going to touch this, why don't we touch this zone?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3122.0) |
|    3125 |  3128 | If you're going to open it like that, then you have a trickle-down effect,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3125.0) |
|    3128 |  3134 | or a waterfall, basically, where you look at all the different zones again.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3128.0) |
|    3134 |  3141 | Just kind of going along those lines, it sounded to me like what you're trying to do                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3134.0) |
|    3141 |  3149 | is find a line where there's pedestrian area, you know, that's closer to the city center,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3141.0) |
|    3149 |  3154 | and there's more vehicular area further away from the city by where you're center city,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3149.0) |
|    3154 |  3158 | where you're drawing the bold lines.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3154.0) |
|    3158 |  3163 | And maybe you're going to try that piece,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3158.0) |
|    3163 |  3169 | and then look at maybe some kind of pedestrian commercial district overlay                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3163.0) |
|    3169 |  3173 | that you could use later on, which would be in similar areas.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3169.0) |
|    3173 |  3177 | Is that kind of a good follow-up to what Councilmember Ryder is saying?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3173.0) |
|    3177 |  3179 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3177.0) |
|    3179 |  3182 | I apologize, Councilmember Smith.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3179.0) |
|    3182 |  3184 | I will call on you now.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3182.0) |
|    3184 |  3188 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3184.0) |
|    3188 |  3201 | This may be obvious to some, but why not use CH in some of these areas?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3188.0) |
|    3201 |  3206 | I mean, another easy solution, I won't say easy solution,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3201.0) |
|    3206 |  3210 | a property owner has the right to ask for rezoning.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3206.0) |
|    3210 |  3215 | They have the right to come in and say, I don't like CG2, I want CH.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3210.0) |
|    3215 |  3219 | It is out there for any property owner to come in or developer to come in and ask for rezoning.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3215.0) |
|    3219 |  3224 | So we're trying to make it address a certain problem,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3219.0) |
|    3224 |  3227 | but rezoning a piece of property is the right of anyone there.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3224.0) |
|    3227 |  3229 | So that is available.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3227.0) |
|    3229 |  3235 | But is there any certain aspect of CH that wouldn't be good for this scenario?                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3229.0) |
|    3235 |  3236 | I'll have to ask.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3235.0) |
|    3236 |  3237 | I'm sure there is.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3236.0) |
|    3237 |  3238 | Yeah, I'm sure there is.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3237.0) |
|    3238 |  3240 | There's a lot of things that are in CH.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3238.0) |
|    3240 |  3241 | Design standards?                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3240.0) |
|    3241 |  3243 | Yeah, design standards or outdoor storage.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3241.0) |
|    3243 |  3249 | I'm not sure, Mike, what's things that are just not attractive for CH.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3243.0) |
|    3249 |  3253 | So there are design standards in CH2.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3249.0) |
|    3253 |  3258 | So there's a level of that that would be applicable even if they're rezoned to CH.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3253.0) |
|    3258 |  3266 | The purpose statement for CH, going back to kind of what the vision is for that district,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3258.0) |
|    3266 |  3271 | is intended to accommodate higher intensity commercial uses of a predominantly auto-oriented character,                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3266.0) |
|    3271 |  3276 | including retail, rental, service establishments of a more intensive commercial character.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3271.0) |
|    3276 |  3280 | It's a good question.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3276.0) |
|    3280 |  3282 | I don't presume to know the answer.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3280.0) |
|    3282 |  3286 | I'm just asking folks that are smarter than I am at this.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3282.0) |
|    3286 |  3292 | So the second thing I think is really important is the public input part of this.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3286.0) |
|    3292 |  3294 | I will take you up on that.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3292.0) |
|    3295 |  3301 | I think the amount of hours that went into recode for not just design standards or zoning,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3295.0) |
|    3301 |  3307 | but also for use were years worth of public input.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3301.0) |
|    3307 |  3314 | And I think it's really important that we provide space for that outside of our typical meetings                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3307.0) |
|    3314 |  3316 | where everybody can come hear those things.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3314.0) |
|    3316 |  3322 | And the last thing I'll say is I really appreciate the macro level view you're taking at this.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3316.0) |
|    3322 |  3331 | Nobody, including you all, want to be dealing with variances and spot zoning and that type of ad hoc decision.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3322.0) |
|    3331 |  3337 | And I think it's unhealthy for communities to be forced with those kind of spot treatments.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3331.0) |
|    3337 |  3345 | So cheers to you all for taking a holistic use or a holistic view on zoning, use, et cetera,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3337.0) |
|    3345 |  3348 | without making one-off decisions.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3345.0) |
|    3348 |  3351 | So thanks.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3348.0) |
|    3351 |  3354 | Mr. Berry, I just want to follow up on that.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3351.0) |
|    3354 |  3357 | Are there different uses in CH and CG?                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3354.0) |
|    3357 |  3359 | Because all the CGs are the same use.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3357.0) |
|    3359 |  3364 | Would there be different uses in CH?                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3359.0) |
|    3364 |  3366 | Yes, there would be.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3364.0) |
|    3366 |  3369 | You're going to get more intense uses in CH.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3366.0) |
|    3369 |  3370 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3369.0) |
|    3370 |  3374 | So that may not be what we're looking for here.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3370.0) |
|    3374 |  3376 | I guess that's an opinion.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3374.0) |
|    3376 |  3377 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3376.0) |
|    3377 |  3380 | I'll call on Councilmember Pugh.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3377.0) |
|    3380 |  3381 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3380.0) |
|    3381 |  3386 | Just a comment or a clarification.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3381.0) |
|    3386 |  3393 | It seems to me that a big part of this problem is, correct me if I'm wrong, I didn't live through recode.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3386.0) |
|    3393 |  3395 | I just watched it.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3393.0) |
|    3395 |  3398 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3395.0) |
|    3398 |  3410 | But it seems like a lot of this is a desire for pedestrian-friendly on a road that was never designed to be pedestrian-friendly                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3398.0) |
|    3410 |  3418 | because it is a state highway, and TDOT's job is to move traffic.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3410.0) |
|    3418 |  3422 | And the city residents would like pedestrian-friendly.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3418.0) |
|    3423 |  3431 | I guess I'm stating the obvious, but I also think when we talk to the community as we think about how we redo this,                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3423.0) |
|    3431 |  3440 | do we really need to make that very clear that some of this may not be within our purview                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3431.0) |
|    3440 |  3447 | to make everything people want pedestrian-friendly as pedestrian-friendly as they would like it to be?                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3440.0) |
|    3447 |  3449 | Does that make any sense?                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3447.0) |
|    3449 |  3454 | Because, I mean, like, I'd like for people to be able to walk everywhere,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3449.0) |
|    3454 |  3463 | but if you have to deal with TDOT and that's not what they designed the road for, how much success will we have,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3454.0) |
|    3463 |  3469 | which is what I think you're trying to get to with these shaded areas.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3463.0) |
|    3469 |  3477 | But I will just say, with no dog in the fight, to use another animal analogy,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3469.0) |
|    3477 |  3490 | I think perhaps a separate name for whatever this is would be helpful.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3477.0) |
|    3490 |  3499 | I guess the question I have is if we don't make this change, what's the likely result?                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3490.0) |
|    3499 |  3506 | Are you going to see in the shaded areas, are you going to see more requests for rezoning?                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3499.0) |
|    3506 |  3509 | Are you going to see more variance requests?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3506.0) |
|    3509 |  3514 | Are you going to see folks who don't get those want to reinvest in their properties?                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3509.0) |
|    3514 |  3519 | What are we looking at?                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3514.0) |
|    3519 |  3526 | More rezoning and variance requests.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3519.0) |
|    3526 |  3530 | The impact here is not on the existing buildings that are already constructed.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3526.0) |
|    3530 |  3533 | As you know, they're there.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3530.0) |
|    3533 |  3541 | It's just for the vacant lots and those like the one that Brian showed that's going to BZA next month                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3533.0) |
|    3541 |  3546 | where they're raising the existing building and building back.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3541.0) |
|    3546 |  3551 | And that applicant is pretty auto-centric.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3546.0) |
|    3551 |  3562 | We're seeing a real push for more drive-throughs, which I think has an impact on what their request is.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3551.0) |
|    3562 |  3573 | It puts a strange burden on the applicants to BZA because they have to show a hardship.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3562.0) |
|    3573 |  3580 | It's tough when it's essentially a greenfield to start with.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3573.0) |
|    3580 |  3586 | I can tell you, Councilwoman Ryder, that the building code comes into play as well.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3580.0) |
|    3586 |  3592 | I understand your concern about walking through the large parking lots.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3586.0) |
|    3592 |  3601 | I welcome you to take a look at the car wash and the boot barn on the corner of Walker Springs and Kingston Pike.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3592.0) |
|    3601 |  3606 | The car wash has a pedestrian path from the sidewalk to the building.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3601.0) |
|    3606 |  3610 | And that's required by building code, and it's for accessibility purposes.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3606.0) |
|    3610 |  3614 | But I think that'll get to your concern of walking through.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3610.0) |

|    3616 |  3617 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3616.0) |
|    3617 |  3618 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3617.0) |
|    3618 |  3619 | That's not a local decision?                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3618.0) |
|    3619 |  3620 | No.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3619.0) |
|    3620 |  3621 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3620.0) |
|    3621 |  3622 | Just confirming.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3621.0) |
|    3622 |  3623 | Yes, ma'am.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3622.0) |
|    3623 |  3630 | So I think there's a lot of ways to get to this ideal of pedestrian-friendly.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3623.0) |
|    3630 |  3632 | We've got our zoning code.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3630.0) |
|    3632 |  3639 | We've got the building code, which doesn't come at it from pedestrian-friendly,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3632.0) |
|    3639 |  3643 | but comes at it from treating people equally.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3639.0) |
|    3643 |  3649 | And if able-bodied people can walk there, albeit through a parking lot,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3643.0) |
|    3649 |  3652 | we need to provide an accessible route as well.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3649.0) |
|    3652 |  3657 | And you can see it on Google Maps.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3652.0) |
|    3657 |  3664 | They're delineated, so even those in automobiles are aware that this is a pedestrian walk.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3657.0) |
|    3664 |  3669 | So I thought I would throw that in there for you.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3664.0) |
|    3669 |  3672 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3669.0) |
|    3672 |  3677 | I guess I'll turn it over to Mr. Cannon for some closing remarks.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3672.0) |
|    3677 |  3683 | But I guess the summary of what I've heard in the workshop today is, you know,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3677.0) |
|    3683 |  3686 | that we have identified a problem,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3683.0) |
|    3686 |  3692 | and the discussion tonight is about what the solutions are that will encourage                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3686.0) |
|    3692 |  3696 | mixed-use and pedestrian commercial areas.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3692.0) |
|    3697 |  3705 | And the recommendation we're receiving is that there are some areas that are compatible with that,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3697.0) |
|    3705 |  3707 | and there are other areas that are not.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3705.0) |
|    3707 |  3712 | And you need our assistance in figuring out where those areas are.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3707.0) |
|    3712 |  3718 | And obviously my colleagues will put on their lights if they don't think that's a correct summary.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3712.0) |
|    3718 |  3724 | But does that sound like what you're hearing as well, so you can take that feedback back with you?                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3718.0) |
|    3724 |  3726 | Yes, sir.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3724.0) |
|    3726 |  3730 | Following up from tonight, some of what you ‑‑ she has a light on.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3726.0) |
|    3730 |  3731 | Let me.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3730.0) |
|    3731 |  3732 | Oh, no.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3731.0) |
|    3732 |  3733 | You go ahead.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3732.0) |
|    3733 |  3734 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3733.0) |
|    3734 |  3736 | I just had a thought question that may not be related.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3734.0) |
|    3736 |  3737 | Well, go ahead.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3736.0) |
|    3737 |  3742 | Oh, just 441 is the TDOT, right?                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3737.0) |
|    3742 |  3745 | TDOT manages ‑‑ I'm sorry, you guys.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3742.0) |
|    3745 |  3747 | I'm in my own wheelhouse.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3745.0) |
|    3747 |  3752 | Broadway is Highway 441, and that's TDOT managed, correct?                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3747.0) |
|    3752 |  3757 | Except for somebody said it switches over to Hall of Fame to Henley,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3752.0) |
|    3757 |  3765 | and then does it pick up for the Henley Street Bridge to Chapman?                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3757.0) |
|    3765 |  3772 | Yeah, there's like two different highways there where 441 hits Hall of Fame Drive                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3765.0) |
|    3772 |  3777 | and then Neyland Drive and around, so yeah.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3772.0) |
|    3777 |  3778 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3777.0) |
|    3778 |  3781 | So I'm just trying to frame this in my mind in a bigger thing based on a couple of comments,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3778.0) |
|    3781 |  3783 | so bear with me here for a second.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3781.0) |
|    3783 |  3788 | So then 441 goes down Chapman Highway to Seymour and exits Knox County.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3783.0) |
|    3788 |  3790 | That's still TDOT, right?                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3788.0) |
|    3790 |  3792 | About 441.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3790.0) |
|    3792 |  3796 | And then it goes all the way down to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, right?                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3792.0) |
|    3796 |  3799 | And then you go up into the Smoky Mountains National Park.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3796.0) |
|    3799 |  3801 | That's still 441, right?                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3799.0) |
|    3801 |  3803 | And that's TDOT?                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3801.0) |
|    3803 |  3804 | Yes.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3803.0) |
|    3804 |  3805 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3804.0) |
|    3805 |  3807 | And just for people, for food for thought, bear with me.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3805.0) |
|    3807 |  3808 | Bear with me.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3807.0) |
|    3808 |  3810 | I'm connecting the dots.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3808.0) |
|    3810 |  3818 | Gatlinburg, which I avoid, to be honest, that whole area is very pedestrian, right?                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3810.0) |
|    3818 |  3824 | A million Americans, I don't know, millions of Americans are within driving distance to vacation there,                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3818.0) |
|    3824 |  3828 | and they all can walk on those sidewalks, and that's 441 right there?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3824.0) |
|    3828 |  3830 | Or does it take the bypass at that point?                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3828.0) |
|    3830 |  3832 | That I don't recall which one.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3830.0) |
|    3832 |  3834 | It may take the spur around.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3832.0) |
|    3834 |  3835 | Okay.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3834.0) |
|    3835 |  3836 | I might find the answer out.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3835.0) |
|    3836 |  3838 | Anyway, I'm tying my thoughts together.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3836.0) |
|    3838 |  3839 | Okay, I'll be quiet.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3838.0) |
|    3839 |  3841 | I just wanted to ask some experts.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3839.0) |
|    3841 |  3842 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3841.0) |
|    3842 |  3843 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3842.0) |
|    3843 |  3847 | I'll let you close.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3843.0) |
|    3847 |  3849 | First is thank you all for your time.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3847.0) |
|    3849 |  3852 | We greatly appreciate it.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3849.0) |
|    3852 |  3855 | We heard you after the November council meeting.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3852.0) |
|    3856 |  3867 | We dove into this, and we realized that this is a deeper subject that a mere tweak could handle.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3856.0) |
|    3867 |  3874 | Just the discussion tonight on options, you see what we were facing as far as doing our best to arrive at the right,                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3867.0) |
|    3874 |  3877 | at the best answer we could.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3874.0) |
|    3878 |  3885 | And to Councilman Smith's point, arriving at that answer we do believe warrants more public input.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3878.0) |
|    3885 |  3891 | What we propose to do after tonight, unless there's a strong, strong objection,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3885.0) |
|    3891 |  3897 | is ask the Planning Commission to revisit this subject.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3891.0) |
|    3897 |  3905 | In all probability, I expect the same recommendation will come back to council subject to input.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3897.0) |
|    3905 |  3911 | I would ask if you could help us get the input to planning as promptly as possible                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3905.0) |
|    3911 |  3917 | as far as the delineation of these excluded corridors.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3911.0) |
|    3917 |  3919 | We believe that's the right first step,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3917.0) |
|    3919 |  3927 | and we would support planning taking that step with the condition that we do,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3919.0) |
|    3927 |  3931 | we all need to revisit this beginning in the fall                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3927.0) |
|    3931 |  3937 | and have that public input to work towards an answer that makes the most sense for all these communities.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3931.0) |
|    3937 |  3939 | So thank you for your time.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3937.0) |
|    3939 |  3945 | And the only thing I'd add to that is with some flexible design standards in CG1.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3939.0) |
|    3945 |  3947 | Thank you all.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3945.0) |
|    3947 |  3954 | We really appreciate you spending the time with us this evening and on this subject.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3947.0) |
|    3954 |  3959 | With no further comments from council, this workshop is adjourned.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230427?start=3954.0) |
