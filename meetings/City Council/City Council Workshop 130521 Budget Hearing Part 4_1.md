| 2:00:52| Well, it was $5 million over five years, and we've already budgeted $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| So the balance on that commitment is $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| Let's hear from Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Jim, what I was going to ask, and what I asked the question earlier, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| in terms of the commitment to those particular projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| and if, for instance, we'll take the Coliseum, for example, that needs some work, you know, update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7269)|
| 2:01:18| as far as ADA and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| Am I understanding this correctly, that the projects that we're looking at for the $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| in other words, we couldn't say next year all of a sudden we need to update the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| In other words, there's several facilities that we have as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| I know there's been talk in the past about expanding the Jacobs Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| because of some work that could be done out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| and then there's the Coliseum, which does need to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| How much flexibility do you have in terms of the $30 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| Or is now the time to ask for $40 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| Well, let me just say that until you actually go to the market, everything is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7313)|
| 2:02:05| We are, and I'll give you a hypothetical example, which may come to be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| we may decide that we are going to bring what we call a resolution of intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| that say that we will self-fund or cash flow these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| until at some point we actually go out to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| Now, when you choose to go out to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| you may well have anticipated that you were going to do 31.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| and, you know, circumstances have changed, and you may decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| well, now it's, you know, we were able to squeeze something out and now it's 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| or conversely there's another project that's desired and you may want to do it at 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| So until you actually go to the market, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| you're not saying that this bond issue is going to be $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| And to be honest with you, even if we did these specific projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7380)|
| 2:03:06| it's going to change from 31.4, I can tell you, because we'll get into issuance costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| and just the sheer numbers and the way we finance it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| it would probably be a premium, but, you know, it won't look like 31.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| That won't be the par amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| Has the administration looked at other potential projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| such as the renovation of the Coliseum or expansion of Jacobs Building or parks or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7406)|
| 2:03:33| We had some general discussion about, you know, other opportunities, capital opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| even including, you know, sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| We had some internal discussion of that, you know, making a big non-incremental jump there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7420)|
| 2:03:46| We really haven't we didn't have, I would say, lengthy discussions about specifics, like, you know, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7426)|
| 2:03:53| how much would it take to put Chell Highway Park in the Coliseum or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| all those other assets to a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| And we didn't partially because I think we decided to keep this ask in terms of the going to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| and not much over 30, and that sort of drove what we considered rather than getting the whole set of possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| and then seeing what it came up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| I guess I'll defer a little to Jim on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| You might say that the 31 as a limit is somewhat arbitrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| but we still want to be fairly careful on how much we commit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| And, of course, you know, we have to take into account what the cost of advertising that over, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| and that's something Jim has taken into account in preparing the budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| as we look for what we can afford yearly, you know, under what you were thinking of 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| under a 20-year repayment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| So I would think the coming up with these, well, first, we knew we had these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| Secondly, we had a goal of somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 35, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| is the max that we thought doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| Much under that, we didn't think was worth going to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| At some point, you want to get it to a certain point or you don't go to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| So coming up with that wasn't, you know, a perfect system of logic that led us to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| But the thinking was we've got these projects we're already obligated to, rates are low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| We think we can comfortably go to 30, a little over 30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| We're not much comfortable going a whole lot higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| You could make an argument to go to 40 or 50, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| But I don't think anybody internally was really interested in pushing the envelope that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| There's a table that says 2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| Let me go to Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| Let him finish with his financial because I want to speak about the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| I was just going to ask, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| you've got a table in your budget that shows $2.1 million a year amortization of that capital debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7537)|
| 2:05:43| Isn't that what I remember seeing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| Like you said, over 20 years or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| You know, in the budget, I have estimated, again, amortization on $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7548)|
| 2:05:57| And that's going to be roughly 2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| And, again, bear in mind that that's an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| That's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| You don't even know the interest rate yet until you go to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| I mean, again, I think I would be fairly close at 2.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| I mean, it might be 2.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| It might be 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| But I don't think it's going to go to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| So, but, and, again, that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| And that's an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| And we've kind of shown you the estimate of what this is going to be over the next 20, well, basically up to 2033.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| The other phrase you stated was that, and I'm going to put words in your mouth because I don't know what words you actually used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7590)|
| 2:06:38| that this was sort of a statement of intent, but until you actually design the bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7598)|
| 2:06:44| you don't know how much you're going to the market for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| So, if that is true, that's the premise, if, for example, George wanted a garage next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| you could go for that, you'd have a resolution and another statement of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| and you'd go for either more money or a different allocation of the same money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| Isn't that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| And let me tell you what a resolution of intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| And a resolution of intent is let's say that we know, and I'll use Lakeshore as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| that the state turns it over to us in some reasonable period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| and we're going to start, you know, tearing down buildings here within the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| Now, and again, we already know that this bond issue is going to take longer than six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| but we may come back to council with what we call a resolution of intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| that says that the city will internally fund the demolition work on Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7656)|
| 2:07:45| with the intent of repaying ourselves from the proceeds of a future bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| Now, and again, we would be very specific in that resolution of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| Now, again, a year from now, when we go to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| we've already said that we're going to repay ourselves with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| But the total amount of the bond issue could change at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| because just other circumstances have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| You know, I think it may appear that I'm trying to, you know, I guess skate on ice or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7694)|
| 2:08:24| but these numbers will all change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| It won't look like 31.4, but we're trying to, you know, once we actually put the deal together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7708)|
| 2:08:35| But, you know, you're looking at our intent to fund these projects at roughly 30, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| And, again, what we're going to submit in cash is probably close to 31.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| but the bond issue is going to look totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| But to go back to the point, you're not foreclosed from adding an additional project mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| Now, again, no, you're not foreclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| But once I bring an initial resolution to issue bonds, that becomes your –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7737)|
| 2:09:05| then you're really starting to set it in stone at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| That's the legal document that governs the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| Let us go to Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Well, I think I'm trying to ask the same question that Duane and now Nick asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7753)|
| 2:09:19| When we do this, we're essentially saying, okay, we approve this outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| But, in fact, if we chose to do a parking garage instead of a whatever, that we could substitute that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7765)|
| 2:09:33| But this is our initial intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| But until you go to the market, that's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Until you actually go to the market, and, again, we will have to bring –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| now it's called a different legal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| We will have to bring an initial resolution to Council before we issue any debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| And that really starts tying all these numbers down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart4?start=7793)|
