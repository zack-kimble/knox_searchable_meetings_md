| 0:02:58| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=178)|
| 0:03:11| That was record time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| Thank you very much, Commissioner. Before I walk through the meeting tonight, and Rob, if you could tell me if he is on with us, I wanted to welcome our Sheriff Tom Spangler for a few moments before we begin our meeting. Sheriff Spangler, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=196)|
| 0:03:35| Yes, I am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Okay. You have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, County Commissioners. I won't take much of your time. Just a couple of things I wanted to address with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| One is something that's been going on now for a little bit. I think all of you all are aware of the courts and with COVID-19 going on and trying to do our best of bringing people either downtown for court or either trying to do it by video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=226)|
| 0:04:04| I've come up with something that I addressed with the judges a couple of weeks ago and also met with the mayor this afternoon on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| And what we're looking at doing is hopefully constructing a building out of our detention facility to where we can hold about six courts going on either at the same time or different times to be able to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=252)|
| 0:04:26| That cost that we're looking at is going to be anywhere from the preliminary that we've gotten is $750,000 for a steel building and us completing that and probably completing it with a total cost of about $1.1 or so million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=266)|
| 0:04:42| I will have more information for hopefully to put on the agenda for the next month or tomorrow. I'm sorry, next week's meeting and get you a little bit more information on that. But I just wanted to bring that to your all's attention of what we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=282)|
| 0:04:56| Not only I think will that save Knox County taxpayers money, but it will also save on our transportation costs and also on the safety and issue that we have to deal with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| So like I said, the judges were all on board and very excited about this. So I think that's a direct going in the right direction for what we need to do, not only now, but to continue that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=305)|
| 0:05:18| And I think that will help everybody concerned. And so I'll get that more information to you by next week. And hopefully you'll have that and you can stay on that and see what you think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=318)|
| 0:05:31| But I think that's a good thing for us to be looking at next. And I hope I get through this. So stay with me. I've gotten several emails, texts, well wishes, thoughts and prayers for the loss of our officers this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=331)|
| 0:05:51| And just in the past few days. Officer Toby Kaiser passed away yesterday. Toby retired from us back in 2017 after 25 years with Knox County Sheriff's Office and came back to work in our warrants unit serving warrants and had gone in the hospital right around Christmas and unfortunately never recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=351)|
| 0:06:16| And his wife, Jill, I've texted her and let her know that anything that we can and we will do. But when we lose one of our own, it's very tough. But to lose three the way that we have and another officer who has a wife that is in there and has been since before Christmas, a 37-year-old young lady and really struggling and having a tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=376)|
| 0:06:44| And that's Tim Stillam's wife, Sarah. And we want to keep her and our thoughts and prayers. Also, Rex Armstrong. Rex just retired from us back in September. I believe it was either September or October of last year. Rex has had some heart issues and had heart surgery and didn't make it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=404)|
| 0:07:11| And we'll keep him, his family, his wife. She goes by Skeeter. Bobby's her real name, but she worked for us as well. And we had another officer that was with us many years ago. A lot of people don't remember. Ken Madaris just passed away this last week as well. So our family's hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=431)|
| 0:07:33| And I just want to say thank you to all of you that sent your prayers and thoughts to us. It means more than I can sit here and tell you, because the men and women going through what they're going through right now is obviously, you know, it's tough. And we'll stick together with it and we will get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=453)|
| 0:07:58| But I'm just asking you all for your continuing prayers and your thoughts for our agency at this time. And we will endure. And again, I can't thank you all enough for those of you that sent those in. So thank you. And Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=478)|
| 0:08:15| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler. I don't know if anybody has any words, but I just want to be thankful to all of the men and women that serve in uniform. And I think it's a stark reminder that we're still very much in the middle of this really difficult pandemic and it affects everybody. So thank you for coming on tonight and sharing that with us. And please let us know what we can do for the for the families and for you all in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=495)|
| 0:08:44| I might just suggest that we all give a brief moment of silence to remember our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=524)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| All right. Getting on to the meeting. Unless I hear any objections, here's how I intended to conduct tonight's work session. First, we will set the agenda and approve the minutes from December commission meeting, then we'll move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=544)|
| 0:09:26| I think we have nine people signed up. So we should be able to complete that all in the first segment with a full allotted time. Then we'll go through the agenda and get on with the business at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=566)|
| 0:09:41| So as I've outlined tonight's run show, do I hear any objections? Okay, let's proceed. Amendments to the agenda include additions that are additions include number 51. We only have one addition that's number 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=581)|

| 0:18:04| today, I just saw it myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| just a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| that as of today, COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| has claimed 400,000 lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1090)|

| 0:18:20| surprising to me to read that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| death rate is four times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1102)|

| 0:19:36| consider what people are saying in the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| and what many of your constituents have told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1178)|

| 0:19:54| vaccines will soon be more available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| but it looks like it's going to be many more months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| before we get out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1198)|

| 0:20:14| does that all mean? As more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1214)|

| 0:20:24| that many more are going to become infected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1224)|

| 0:23:26| And my goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| really is to speak about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| serious and deadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| this pandemic has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1412)|

| 0:23:36| As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| you just heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| the disease is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| likely to pandemic is likely to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| much worse before it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| any better. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| know as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| fact that adhering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| to sound public health policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1434)|

| 0:23:58| quickest way out of this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| And I strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| believe that now is not the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| to strip the Board of Health of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| its authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Rather, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| should be encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| and enforcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| the wise recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| of the Board of Health. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| irresponsible of our leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| to strip the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| of their authority. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| the last time I spoke to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| county commission, I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| repeatedly from members of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| rowdy group of protesters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| that the virus is worse than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| the flu. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| certainly hope that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| true that many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| particularly younger people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| who get COVID-19 do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| get seriously ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| But they do give it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| other people. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| let's look at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| of our own local statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| If you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| if you live in Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1502)|

| 0:25:08| and you get COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| there's an almost 20 percent chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1510)|

| 0:25:20| If you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1520)|

| 0:25:26| wish, but if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| that's the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| cases that have been reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1530)|

| 0:25:38| 60 percent is the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1538)|

| 0:25:58| Today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| we passed, as you just heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| the 400,000 deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1562)|

| 0:26:08| is now the leading cause of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| But the actual numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| of deaths that can be attributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1572)|

| 0:26:16| greater than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| If you look at excess deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1578)|

| 0:26:22| and I don't know that you can see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| but the number is well over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1584)|

| 0:26:30| seeing demographically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| is a decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1592)|

| 0:26:58| It's gone down three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| times more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| So, there's huge social inequities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=1624)|

| 0:42:08| the slot remains open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=2528)|

| 0:51:52| us the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3112)|

| 0:51:56| to ask the Law Director's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| to condemn that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| but those are only in very, very rare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| cases. Typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| we condemn probably somewhere in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| neighborhood of two to three percent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| cases we deal with. We go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| to extra lengths to avoid that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| at all cost. We certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| do an appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| let the owner review that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| and certainly consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3138)|

| 0:52:22| consideration, any concerns they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| So I don't anticipate any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| condemnations on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| this, and we've spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| to pretty much all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| landowners on these particular cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| so I would expect them to go pretty smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3156)|

| 0:52:40| Is there additional discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Mr. Snowden, I know that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| had discussed the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| on Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Mill Lane. Were you able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| work with that one property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| to get that resolved then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| We were, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Actually, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| we did on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| the only reason we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| a, and that was actually item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| 34, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| we're acquiring three acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| those were actually donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| because we could have built that sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| and it was intended to be built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| the right-of-way along the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| and to do so, it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| removed a bunch of large, mature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| trees that were in the right-of-way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| those landowners would have lost a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| and wouldn't have been compensated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| We realigned the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| got it off onto their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| for their benefit, and they're giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| us that easement so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| maintain that sidewalk in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Really, it was kind of a win-win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| there for us. The sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| costs the same. They donate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| the property and they still get their privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| and have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| trees to buffer them from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| That's a good compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| there, we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Well, great. I appreciate you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| working that out with the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3240)|

| 0:54:04| Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3246)|

| 0:54:20| he pulled them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| for the same question. Do you have any objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| if we move to approve all four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| of those items at the same exact time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3266)|

| 0:54:34| what you're voting on, and make sure it's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3274)|

| 0:54:50| in the agenda. And that way, you can do it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| one vote. Okay. Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| is that okay with you? Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3294)|

| 0:58:16| Article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3496)|

| 0:58:20| Article 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| Yeah, short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| This is under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| some of the CARES Act funding. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| CDC money. There's no county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| involved in this and it's part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| epidemiology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| and lab capacity, but it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| preventing illness. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| it's allowed to be used for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| purpose of housing homeless folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| have to be in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| And so what changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| is they're operating a larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| space and they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| added a few more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| staff members under their scope of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| and it's a 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| 7 admission process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| So those are some of the changes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| now if somebody is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| diagnosed with COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| at the hospital and they're homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| the hospital has one phone call to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| and they can get somebody housed overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| instead of having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| maybe call my staff or house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| somebody overnight at the hospital who doesn't need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| hospitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3558)|
| 0:59:30| You went mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3570)|

| 0:59:38| You are still mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| We have lost your audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| I think they're working on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Did that answer your question, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Daley or did you have further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| Dr. Buchanan can send it to us in email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Just wondering how many beds that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| increase for the homeless to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| taken care of. So you can send that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| us in an email or show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| your fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| Looks like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| audio is still trouble, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| I'm getting a message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| from a member of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Dr. Buchanan's staff that she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| relaying the information in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| form or fashion. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| that's okay with you, the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| we can move forward the motion and ask for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| information sent offline before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| next week. And it can always be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| pulled off consent next week. So right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Daley with a second by Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| to approve item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| We can hear you now. Okay. Did you have an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| for that before we close this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Well, I didn't hear his question because I muted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| because I was trying to go back in on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| you want to restate the question, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Yes, Mr. Chairman. Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| B, how many beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| are, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| will increase to help the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| homeless at this volunteer ministry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| So they currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| have 10 beds with the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| expand the number of beds they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3678)|

| 1:03:56| was looking through the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3836)|

| 1:04:00| Shawna maybe or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Shawna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| It's Shawna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Good evening. How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Good. How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| I'm going to throw some questions out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| You might have seen them on the board there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| What is the management fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Projected revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| And what does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| I'll take that one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| for the fees for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| foundation, they'll only get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| if there's a profit. And in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| case, they'll be paid half of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| net profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| For the question on projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| revenues, they project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| $101,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| for Concord Golf Course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| and $44,000 for Beverly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Golf Course for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| final revenue projection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| of $145,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| And the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| calls for basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| a never-ending one-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| I thought we were trying to get away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| those type of contracts and just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| like a five-year, one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| terms. Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Yeah. So that actually was an oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| on my part. So that's a good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| That was my original intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| So if it would please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| the commissioners, I can see if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| law department can change that to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| it'll be a yearly renewal for up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| a maximum of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| Yeah. That would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| be good. And I have no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| with you guys, you know, after five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| years, renewing it for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| five years. But seems like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| need to get into a never-ending contract again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| No, I agree. That was a good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Thank you very much. Appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| it. That's my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| would you consider moving that forward without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| recommendation and seeing if they could verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| and get the language right for next week before we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| ahead and put it on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Yes, sir. I'll change my motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Okay. And Commissioner Gerd, are you okay with that on the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| The motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| Quick question. Oh, yes. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Have they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| were they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| the previous contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| at both these locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| or these brand new for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=3976)|

| 1:09:38| Services because although the contract for First Bank begins next month, there is a several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| month overlap in services, setting up of structure and some of the accounts and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| sure that everything transitions. So, while one contract will begin, it will be an overlap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| of about five to six months of time. That certainly could be completed sooner than June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| 30th if they wanted to get enough time. So, that's why you have one new one and one extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| And I know the trustee is with us. I do know that members of First Bank are also with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4207)|

| 1:12:47| Madam Clerk, if you would please read the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| It's resolution 906, approving a contract with Purdue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| Brandon Felder, Collins, and Mott LLP for the provision of collection services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| First by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you pulled this from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Is somebody by chance here from criminal court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| If not, we could defer it to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| I'm here, Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I didn't see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| And just if you wanted to kind of review it, I know notice that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| firm is a specialist in this type of collections and that they're based out of Houston, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4412)|
| 1:13:40| And, you know, the question from a constituent this week was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| does anybody offer those services that's located in the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Commissioner, I'm sure they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Just as a background, we have an in-house collections group that try to collect funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| from criminal sessions and Fourth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| When we get to the point where we don't feel we can collect those anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| we turn them over to a collections company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Now, this company was selected through our procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| We had a company that had been doing this for about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| They were based out of Ohio, and they were specialists in collections of court fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| fees, forfeitures, restitution, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Their contract was up, and so it needed to be rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| And so Matt Myers, Jay Garrison, and a couple of people from our staff all got together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| formed a committee, and we solicited bids, and we solicited contracts, proposed contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| I think we had 11 people that came and said they were interested in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| We narrowed it down to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| And the company that received the bid, and I believe it was unanimous on everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| was this group out of Houston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| And again, they are specialists in collections of court costs and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| It's not everybody that does that type of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| because these are very hard to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| As you might imagine, our constituents and our clientele move around a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| and so sometimes they're very difficult to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| And so it takes a specialized group that does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| So as far as in Tennessee, I'm sure there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| I don't know the names of those companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I just know that the final four were presented and that the committee, I was not on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| but the committee recommended this group, and so we have a contract for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| Yes, and I noticed that their credentials were exceptional as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| And then the collection fee, in other words, if there's a thousand dollars due and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4533)|
| 1:15:41| collect the thousand, you, they keep 20 percent and you get the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4547)|
| 1:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| And then if you have to do a garnishment of wages, it was a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| They, if it's a thousand dollar garnishment, do they, is the collection amount 1250 where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4553)|
| 1:16:03| they add on 25 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| They would add on their percentage fee, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| Okay, so that the person that's being garnished would pay the fee plus an additional 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| percent for the collector's fee then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Yes, and that's why we try to be aggressive in collecting the money ourselves so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| we don't add on those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| We only turn the, we only turn them over if we're kind of at wit's end and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| think we're going to be able to collect it, but we feel like it could be collected, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| so we turn it over to the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Right, and then roughly how much do you think potentially that you could collect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| I will tell you that the capital recovery group, they had the contract for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| They collected almost $2 million, and so we're hopeful that this company that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| using out of Texas, we're excited about their credentials, and we think they can do even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| But yes, it was approximately $2 million over a four-year period that the other company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| was able to collect for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4623)|
| 1:17:03| Well, and again, I appreciate the efforts of the Procurement Department to find a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| vendor to fill this need, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| Mr. Chairman, that was all questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Yeah, Mike, do you still have the program where they can work off the fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| We do, but we haven't been very successful with that because of COVID, and so that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| been put on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| So we have not, we haven't had anyone go into that program probably in about a year, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| the main reason has been because of COVID, because there's not a lot of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| for people to go out and work simply because they try to keep people socially distanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| and that type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| But we do have, hopefully we can get back to it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| For our new commissioners and anyone that's listening, will you explain what your program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4674)|
| 1:17:54| And I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| It's an opportunity for people, if they want to, they can come and do community service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| work and actually work off their fees if they're found to be indigent, or they have a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| and ability to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| We do have that program available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| We have had people take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| But as I said, because of COVID, we haven't had people take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| And frankly, we wouldn't want them to take advantage of it right now because there aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| people who want people to come out and do community service work until the pandemic's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| And if you would, sir, just identify yourself for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Oh, Mike Hammond, Criminal Court Clerk, Room 149, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4714)|
| 1:18:34| Is that all your questions, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| You still had your hand up on the chat window there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Any additional comments or discussion on Item Number 51?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| We have a motion to approve by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4741)|
| 1:19:01| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4744)|

| 1:19:43| Thank you very much, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Next item on non-consent is item number 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| If you'd please read the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| It's Ordinance O-20-12-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 38, Article 2, Division 1, Section 38-33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| entitled County Board of Health to provide for the Board of Health to serve as an advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| board to the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| This amends Ordinance Number O-96-3-102, adopted April 22nd, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4810)|
| 1:20:18| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Just a little housekeeping thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| I did not add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| This number was not in the non-consent items at the beginning of when we set our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| but as an ordinance under second reading, it would automatically be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| So, I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| When we set the agenda, I just double-checked my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Commissioner Ward on the first, Commissioner Bussler on the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| to move forward to next week without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Is there a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| You're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| You're still on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| We can always be trained, can't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| It seems like about two and a half weeks ago that the sponsor of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| basically said to the community that he was going to defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| So, you know, a lot of people have been very concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| And both with e-mails and phone calls to me, as I'm sure as to everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| And their interpretation is that at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| we would be taking action to defer this for X number of time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| So, has that now changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| Commissioner Ward, I see your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Yeah, I think there's a little misinterpretation on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| I said there's a possibility that it'd be deferred, but it's not up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| I wanted to go to a vote and for us to talk about it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| And so I was going to bring it up next week and take it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| I wasn't planning on doing anything this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| And I said that, but obviously, the media wasn't listening 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Well, I just I feel like the message was incorrectly sent to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4939)|
| 1:22:33| And so I'm very concerned about taking any action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| where there the assumption was this is going to be delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| So if we're going to discuss that further next week, then I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| you know, that obviously is the option of the maker of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| So I guess my impression was at the work session, we would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4974)|
| 1:23:03| you know, this is going to be deferred for X number of time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| based on what the media and what the public has understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| So I'll relinquish the floor, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| You want me to respond or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| Sure, if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| I'm of the opinion that it shouldn't just be me making the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| That's why I want to bring it to a vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| So it's not so we're more in unison with everything that's been going on between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| death threats, bombings, storming of the Capitol, having death written on the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| the board of the health department, one of our mayor's houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| I wanted to have a conversation next week about us having a genuine conversation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| where we all stand on this and if we want to do a unison vote to move it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| to delay it for a month at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| But I'm still very much for passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| It's still my opinion, but I'm just one person and I'm willing to be a team player| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| and have all of us together decide to postpone it 30 days to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| But I wanted to have that discussion next week so that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| have more of a unification, I guess, to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Director Booker, I just have a quick question from a parliamentary standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| Is there anything that prevents on an ordinance in a second reading from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| taking action during the work session to table it for a certain amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Or does that have to be done at the meeting next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| All you can do really is send it on no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| And then, as Commissioner Ward said, this body can do what it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| It can postpone it, discuss the postponement for a time certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| which is how it got here today, which was a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| So, a work session is not a voting session, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| So, yeah, just double checking that there wasn't any other mechanism for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Is there any further discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5124)|
| 1:25:34| If you vote yes, it moves to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| If you vote no, does it, this is another parliamentary question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| Mr. Booker, if it votes no to move forward to recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| to move forward to next week, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| In my opinion, it's still, since it's an ordinance, it still goes on the agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| I don't think you can kill the second reading of an ordinance at a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| So, that's the only motion that can't happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| What Kyle Ward has said, yes, I think that's the only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| Okay, just clarifying on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| All right, Madam Clerk, if you would, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| Please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5178)|

| 1:29:34| No action required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| Daly, you chaired that committee and submitted a report. I'll call on you to maybe walk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| And if you'd like, I could share the screen to show the report or you could just walk us through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| it. Either one. Well, you can show the screen. But before you do that, is the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| Jill, was supposed to do a resolution to dissolve the subcourt committee. And I thought it was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| this item, but I do not see it. So is Jill available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| Yes, I'm here. It's on the agenda. It just wasn't pulled. It's on the consent. I think it is 901| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5405)|
| 1:30:14| number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5414)|

| 1:30:18| Yeah, that was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Okay, good. All right. Thank you, Jill, for that clarification. Again, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| if you want to pull that up, we'll go over it real quickly. Not going to spend a whole lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| Okay, let me get to the point where I can share the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| While the chairman's doing that, we did a committee on committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| to look at the committees that we have in Knox County. And this is attached to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| Knox County website to the agenda. We met three times. And Knox County has 52| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5448)|
| 1:30:57| listed committees and boards and seven utility districts. 23 of these are set up as under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| TCA codes can only be removed through state legislative action. 22 are Knox County charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5463)|
| 1:31:11| code or a resolution that can only be changed by either the charter or by commission action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| And the seven others are set up by laws or an agreement with city and county officials of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| either the city of Knoxville. Some we have area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| committees that are economic and all that. And they're set up by like Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| Anderson County, and all those. We met on October 19 and talked about a few committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5495)|
| 1:31:43| And the main one we really talked about was the core subcommittee, which I got with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| the clerk, Mike Hammond, and we discussed it. And it was a committee that we don't really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| what it was set up for, but we determined that it's not needed, that if it ever is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| we can always do an ad hoc committee to address any concerns. Also, we talked about the arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5521)|
| 1:32:10| use committee, whether it was useful or not. And we agreed that the arena use committee is useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| even though that Thompson Bowling has been paid off. We still get to know some benefits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| concerts coming in. I believe Commissioner Schoenmaker, Biggs, and Carringer was on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| last year. They found out some concerts that were coming in and alcohol sales coming to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| arena that we did not know about. So we decided that this is an important committee. So we kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| the arena committee. We also talked about, I was concerned about the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5563)|
| 1:32:52| how the ethics committee has turned into really a political committee. And the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| out of the last five or six, I don't think I've got it here, but out of the last five or six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| it was really the ethics committee turned into, I'm going to use the word witch hunt against some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| of the elected officials that were running for office and the other ones. So we did meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| Chairman Michael Covington and Vice Chair Kim Frazier. And they did agree to go back and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| at their rules to make sure that the ethics committee does not turn into a political type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| political nature, that it's going to be I got you type committee when somebody wants to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| for public office. And lastly, we did a motion to dissolve the court subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| which we will be doing next week. And that is the summary, hopefully, that explains what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. I'm going to stop sharing that. I appreciate everybody's work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| on that. That is, I think, the first time that the county commission has done a comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| review of its own committees and structures. And it was a daunting task. So it seems weird to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| a committee on committees, but it was very necessary. And I appreciate the works that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| everybody put in. That was a specially formed committee. And this spread of record and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| action tonight would complete the work of that special formed committee. So I would like to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| all the fellow commissioners that served with us. And thanks to Drew and Sharon for helping me out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| on the big five big books that they got there in the commission office. Mr. Hill. Yes, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| wanted to thank the wonderful job, really, Carson, that you did leading our group. I will say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| going into this and seeing how many committees we had, I think I speak for several of us when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| we thought, oh, man, we can just clean this up. We can make this so much sleeker. And we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| lot of extra weight here. And we may, in fact, still have a lot of extra weight. But by the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| we took things out that were either TCA or charter related, it left a very, very few to even be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| to consider. So that's just input. And it was a great learning experience. But thank you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5713)|
| 1:35:21| Daly. Thank you, Commissioner Hill. I also think that it is helpful to kind of get it all organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| now for the future. Having you all gone through this, now we have a better understanding of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| we have and what why it's there and future commissioners will benefit from your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| So thank you for that. Item number 55 was pulled from consent and was to be done tonight. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5738)|

| 1:38:15| And across the state, particularly with our First Lady here in Tennessee, we are raising awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5895)|

| 1:38:29| We focus our service in a couple of different areas. So, we provide community education and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5909)|

| 1:38:40| response to human trafficking. And a lot of that is due to kind of our evolution of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5920)|
| 1:38:47| this issue in our community. We started back in 2010, our agency did, and we worked primarily with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| raising awareness about human trafficking. Inevitably, the questions that our general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| public has when it comes to human trafficking is, what is that? What does that really look like? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| why is that important to our community? We're not just battling lack of information about human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| trafficking. We're oftentimes battling misinformation. Specifically, our social media oftentimes might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5948)|

| 1:39:22| what we see in our community, and particularly for the kids who are affected by human trafficking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| East Tennessee, it is predominantly a relational exploitation. So, our most common form of trafficking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| for the kids that we serve is familial trafficking, which means family member as a trafficker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| It is very common for us to see mom as a trafficker for the kids that we serve. So, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| understand why it's so important for our community to understand that distinction. We can't respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| to the problem if we don't recognize what it is. And so, Knoxville has done a fantastic job raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| awareness and then taking that next step to get the specialized training. We offer about seven or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=5994)|

| 1:40:40| it kind of sets the standard for the state of Tennessee. Oftentimes, when we work with our DCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| partners on a statewide level, they're coming to us to ask us about how this community is responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| And a great example of that, it's hard to qualify. This is great. I recognize that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| overall is not a good thing. But during the pandemic, for example, during quarantine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| we know that the DCS referrals across the board for all types of victimizations were dropping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| dramatically throughout the state. Our referrals for trafficking for kids being trafficked were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| increasing dramatically. So, we were, you know, kind of counterintuitive to the trend that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| happening across the state. And that was because of our community relationships that we had built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| and those conversations that we had started. And then, we provide direct services. I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6084)|

| 1:41:53| We do provide direct services to adults, both men and women in East Tennessee, and as I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6113)|

| 1:42:04| Tennessee to meet survivors in their home. Many of our survivors, particularly some of our adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6124)|

| 1:42:23| or job training. And so, we provide that to them. For the kiddos that we serve in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| oftentimes, transportation and logistics is part of the struggle. So, we travel out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| to provide therapeutic services, to provide case management, and try to meet them where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| as much as possible to reduce those hurdles. We also have an emergency receiving center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6161)|

| 1:46:41| direct services, particularly in our more rural counties, there are a lot of school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6401)|

| 1:47:01| Commissioner Smith, do you have additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Any other questions by other commissioners? Commissioner Daley, I think I see your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| Yes. Working with some of the organizations in South Knoxville, the community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| I'm finding out that the homeless is a real high traffic, human trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| Can you expand on that and kind of fill us in on what's happening with our home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| Yeah. You know, trafficking, I feel like the name of the crime in and of itself is a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| a misnomer. It sounds like kind of this highly organized and very mobile crime. The reality is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6455)|
| 1:47:42| trafficking is 100% based on exploiting an individual's vulnerability. So one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| why an individual in the homeless population might be a higher risk for trafficking is their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| vulnerability is inherent, right? If I see you sleeping on the side of the street, I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| you have a vulnerability and I know that I can fix that vulnerability pretty quickly. I can offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| you a quick solution to that. And so we see that as kind of a quick insight, a quick opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6481)|
| 1:48:08| for traffickers to make a connection, to offer a solution. We know for a fact, we work really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6488)|
| 1:48:18| closely with the law enforcement task force here in Knoxville. We have been tracking traffickers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| who have traveled throughout East Tennessee. One in particular comes to mind who is literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| he hunts at homeless shelters. Does it here in Knoxville and does it up in Johnson City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| just comes and makes connections there and starts the conversation with his potential victims there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6515)|
| 1:48:44| If you could maybe stop sharing your screen and we'll go back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| sort of face-to-face dialogue. There you go. Did you have additional questions, Mr. Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6528)|
| 1:48:55| No, thank you. I know it is a serious problem and not only that, but drugs and sex trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6535)|
| 1:49:02| everything is a big problem in the homeless area. Absolutely. Commissioner Hill, I saw your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| Yes, thanks. I appreciate, I absolutely appreciate the work that you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| And I'm looking at your list of community partners that you have. I'm wondering if you could speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6554)|
| 1:49:24| what kind of efforts are made to not have a duplication of services. I see you talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| you know, the work that you do in our schools and teacher training as well as student training. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| you know, I know a couple of these other organizations also do that too. So sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| one of our biggest issues with social services is that everybody, and I'm not at all suggesting you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6584)|
| 1:49:52| do this, please do not misunderstand, but sometimes everybody doesn't really know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| everybody else is doing. And so we've got this duplicate set of services. Could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| Absolutely. That's a great question. We address that issue very intentionally. As I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6603)|
| 1:50:11| about our referrals, we are busting at the seams with the amount of work that we have to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| And so we are always working to make sure our community is responding in an appropriate way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| for those that we serve, but also in a fiscally responsible way for all of our agencies, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| we're not duplicating services, that we're not kind of overlapping with each other. So for a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| example of that is last Friday, we held a community-wide, we called it It Takes All of Us event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| for kids. And so we had, I think, close to 30 or 35 community partners. And basically it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| a bit of a cattle call. Any agency that served kids who potentially could experience trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| they were invited to the table. We spent about two and a half hours on Zoom talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| issues of trafficking, but then wrapped up the meeting saying, hey, who's doing what? And where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| do we need to fill the gaps? And what services are out there so we're not duplicating services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| And so one of the things that we're doing as a community coalition is kind of creating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| reference guide for all of our partners, but certainly for our services as well to inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| our growth as an agency to say, hey, here's who's in that lane and how they're doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| And so that we can fill the gaps that are there, because there are plenty of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| but to make sure that we're kind of holding up all of our community partners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| We recognize this issue is big and it's hard. It's hard enough on its face. And so we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| want to make it any harder. We're just trying to utilize all the resources, the wonderful resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| that we have in this community to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Marcella Nunez-Smith Wonderful. Thank you. I look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| to seeing that resource guide you put together of specific services that each of your partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| offers. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Marcella Nunez-Smith Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6710)|
| 1:51:50| James Jensen Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| I have a quick question. First off, thank you for the very important work you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| but what can we do as commissioners? What can we do to better inform our constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| What are some, you know, some focus, simple things that might help you and your efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| Marcella Nunez-Smith Yeah, I think so much of this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| and it sounds trite, but it's about conversations and about using each of those opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| whether it's in social media or conversation. I always joke I'm pretty much uninvited to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| family gatherings from this point out, because nobody wants to sit beside me at the dinner table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| But, you know, using those opportunities when folks are talking about stories they've read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| or things I've seen on social media to inform folks about the reality, you know, and to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| informed yourself so that you can speak about it fluently, that you can speak about it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| an educated perspective. But to help just shift that tide, shift that kind of, those blinders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6759)|
| 1:52:49| that we have on as a society to make sure that we're actually addressing the reality of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| this is happening to our neighbors, to our friends, to our church members, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| that this is something that's pretty prevalent within our community, and it's happening right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| in front of us. And it's very difficult to detect. It's hard to determine, particularly for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| kids that we serve. It's hard for them to determine on the surface, this is what it's going to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| like, or this is how it's going to present. This is all about having relationships with those who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| you know, we're surrounded by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| Thank you. Additional questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| I'm not seeing any. So, thank you for the presentation. And if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| if you could send us additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| then I'm sure we'll be happy to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| All right. Thank you so much for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| You're welcome. Thank you very much. I complete item number 57. And moving on to item number 58,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6818)|
| 1:53:45| Madam Clerk, if you could please read that, and then I'll turn it over to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| Schoonmaker to start the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| This is a discussion item regarding the establishment of a redistricting committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Thank you, Chairman Jay. Well, one of the most important functions that the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| will do in 2021 will be the redistricting of all nine County Commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6848)|
| 1:54:16| And, of course, obviously, this is mandated by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| You know, one of the disadvantages to term limits is we don't have any commissioners that went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| through this back in 2011. So, this is going to be new for all 11 of us. Some of our colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| in the surrounding counties have that expertise to rely on, but we don't. But anyways, I was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| pleased to see many of you that participated in the Office of Local Government Training on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| redistricting. I think that started to help get things going and just kind of understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| process and procedure. And, of course, you were provided with an excellent position paper that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6898)|
| 1:55:06| Chairman Jay sent out to you over the weekend, which kind of gives you a lot of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6906)|
| 1:55:15| And then there is a handbook that's going to be available from the Office of Local Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6915)|
| 1:55:23| in February of this year. But if you want to go back to the 2011 handbook, it does give you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6923)|
| 1:55:31| quick kind of an overview of how the data is presented and what your responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6931)|
| 1:55:39| And then, of course, because we're going to be responsible for setting up the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6939)|
| 1:55:46| I did go back and look at what they did, what the recommendations were in 2011. And basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| the state said that, you know, you can have all your commissioners or some of your commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| but you should also definitely have your elections administrator. And, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6959)|
| 1:56:06| people who want to serve on this committee should be very in tune at looking at data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| and also have a pretty logical sense of how a map works to understand when you're drawing a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6971)|
| 1:56:19| down John Sevier, which is north and which is south or whatever. So but I just wanted to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| this to the forefront so that everybody could start thinking about it and who might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| serve on that. And, of course, we can discuss it further next week. But I think if you saw the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| training, you realize how important this is for everybody in Knox County. And, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=6998)|
| 1:56:45| when we redistrict our county commission seats, that also affects the school board seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| So those are actually the same. So, Mr. Chairman, I'll turn that back over to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker. I might just for a second go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| sort of white paper that was sent to everybody. Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| do you want to chime in before I do that? Yes, I just want to thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| I just want to clarify something. State law does not require us to do it through a committee. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| can do it through the body of county commission. It is recommended that it is done through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| committee. Okay. Thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| I'm going to share my screen again. And if you all could see this, this is the white paper that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| emailed to you earlier that just kind of breaks down the basics of it. As Commissioner Skinmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7052)|
| 1:57:39| said, this is the process to go through and determine the lines for the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7059)|
| 1:57:48| The goal is to determine the ideal population and divide it up amongst the nine commission districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7068)|
| 1:57:56| based on the total population. The processes and the guidelines are all set forth by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| State of Tennessee Comptroller's Office and TCA law. And then establishing a redistricting plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7081)|
| 1:58:08| and committee is important to be able to go through this work. It's very labor intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| And then, of course, that comes back to be adopted by the legislative body at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| the process to certify it. Voting districts are established separately by the County Election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| Commission. So, that is not done by this body. And school districts, of course, will also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7105)|
| 1:58:32| impacted as they follow ours. Some of the baseline rules are it has to be done every 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| has to be used using the latest federal census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| Our district should be reasonably compact, whatever that's an interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| contiguous and not overlap. One of the interesting things were if you have a large prison population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| there is a provision in the law that talks about that you may be able to exclude the prison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| population if they cannot register to vote. And that's a whole other element. And given how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| people we have in the detention facility, that may be something that we want to look at as to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| their home voting district is and if they have the ability to vote. And there's a hundred things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| involved with that. One of the most interesting parts about this is that any redistricting must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| comply with what they call the 10 percent rule, which is essentially deviation beyond a 10 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| threshold, meaning you couldn't fundamentally shift a district completely and change it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7166)|
| 1:59:32| than 10 percent. And, of course, you also have to consider Voting Rights Act during that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| And there's a lot of the minutiae and details in that. The resources come from the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| Comptroller. They're going to provide data, software maps, additional support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| And then here's the timeline. This is really important for us to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| The data is going to come to us in two dumps. First one is going to be released in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| Second one will be in April. And those are two different sets of data. I believe the first set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| is sort of a big picture view. And then the second one is the real detailed versions. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7204)|
| 2:00:11| have said that they would like to see us have the formation of that redistricting committee done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| by March. So that would be it would be on the March agenda. It would start its work in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| And April would be a reorganization or sorry, the organization of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| chair, vice chair, et cetera, and sort of understanding of the rules. And really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| the work begins in May. And the work needs to be completed by December 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7231)|
| 2:00:39| December 31st, 2021. But in our case, it actually really needs to be done much before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| Our goal from talking to several commissioners, I also spoke to several former commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7245)|
| 2:00:53| that were around in the last districting. And it really given that we have a 2022 election cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| with petitions that are up to be picked up in December. We should really work on trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| our redistricting done by October and have a month's buffer in case we need to move back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| because people that are going to run for office need to know are they what district they might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| running for. And depending on where the lines are, that may change. And so we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| wait to the last minute to rush through things. So this is one of those committees where you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| want to form it and kind of pick it up in the summer. You got to get on it. If you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| to do it, you got to do it fast. And you got to do it diligently. And you got to get through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| in a timely way, especially as fast as our county is growing, there's going to be a lot of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| to sort through. So we need to start almost immediately. And the big thing to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7298)|
| 2:01:45| tonight, I think, and we can go into next week, is in addition, while we might call on the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7305)|
| 2:01:53| department, or we might call on KGIS, or we might call on different groups, the key question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| committee or for this commission to think about is, who do we want to put on to the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| Most committees that are functional and productive are somewhere between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7327)|
| 2:02:16| seven and 11 members. If you get way more than that, it gets hard. If you get way less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| it has its own thing. So I would open up the floor to talk about who do we want to have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| this commission? I think most white say that election administrator is a key one. Somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| representing the school board is a key one. Planning is probably a key one. I think the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| debate is county commissioners. And I've seen a couple of models thrown out. One is you put every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7360)|
| 2:02:47| commissioner on there, and everybody's a part of it. Another model says you would suggest to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| just the two at-large commissioners on there because they represent everybody, but don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| have a particular district. And that way, you don't have, you know, every district fighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| for every district, so to speak, or not fighting, but, you know, sort of advocating for their one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| district and the lines that are changing there. And then, of course, you know, health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| has a ton of data and information about everything from, you know, socioeconomic to health disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| et cetera. And then, of course, KGIS is a partner. So I would suggest that tonight we hash this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| a little bit. We're, we, this is the last thing on our agenda, and we really need to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| on this. So I'll kind of open the floor from that. I'll stop sharing this and call on Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| Biggs. Thank you, Chairman. My question is, on these committees, can we also have guest speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7420)|
| 2:03:46| like I would like to maybe hear from somebody from TDOT, as well as maybe KUB, where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| setting polls and things of that nature, where, you know, things like that can be very beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| to us. Would that be something we can look into, as well? You can have as many speakers as you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| and you can have as many people participate in the committee as a non-voting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| These are the voting members. So when you get down to, say, a decision of do we draw this line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| here or there, there are going to be a certain amount of people on the committee will have a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| and then that will come out of that committee, you know, voting 7-0 or, you know, 4-3 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| some odd number, and then it'll come to committee for certification. So you can have as many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| as you want, but what we really need to figure out is who are, who has the votes on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| and how many people are going to have a voting, you know, member. Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| Commissioner Hill? And I see you, Commissioner, or Director Book, I'll get, you'll be up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7477)|
| 2:04:44| Thank you. I had some involvement, indirect involvement back when this occurred 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7484)|
| 2:04:54| and just for those of you that perhaps have not thought through this, I will say a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7494)|
| 2:05:03| things that really stand out is it truly is driven by population, and the moving of lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7503)|
| 2:05:13| and redistricting is driven. So if you, if you live in an area where people are leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| it is going to, that area will, can certainly expand geographically. However, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7520)|
| 2:05:34| the numbers still theoretically are supposed to remain pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| If you have any ideas of serving and thinking that this is going to be the opportunity to line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| up the schools, I'm here to tell you that that is, it is a, it is a impossibility. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7546)|
| 2:05:55| it is because it leads back to direct population and not so much a proximity of where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7555)|
| 2:06:04| of where the schools are located. So it's a, it's a very eye-opening. I think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7564)|
| 2:06:13| it's a, it can be exciting, but certainly, certainly challenging because there are these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| parameters set that have to be abided by. So that's my, that's my two cents. Don't get on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7578)|
| 2:06:25| if you think you're going to align all the schools, because it will not happen just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| geographically. It just cannot happen. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| Thank you, Commissioner Hill. Director Book, if you want to chime in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| I just want to add in, I thought the summary that you had there was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7600)|
| 2:06:46| Our charter provides that Knox County Commission shall, every 10 years, by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| reset and reapportion, reset the districts and reapportion. That's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7612)|
| 2:06:59| So you've got to look at two readings to get, to get it done by the 10-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| it says under our charter, starting December 1 in 20, in 1991. So we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7625)|
| 2:07:14| And the other thing is that you've got to be aware of, and I, it's not, this isn't my verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| this is the Supreme Court's verbiage, one man, one vote. It should be one person, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| And the law is very clear. And we all know that, I think inherently, that all reapportionment has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| to be the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which is written into our Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7652)|
| 2:07:39| as being a one person, one vote. So I think that's inherent. Everybody knows and understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| How you do it is up to you all. Thank you, Director Book. That's a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| on the timing. So that really does, if it's two readings, separate to the fact that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| maybe have the ability to do special called meetings, if it were to fall regular order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| you would want your, you would, you would really want your first reading to be in October and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| second reading to be in November, so that you were voting on it before petitions were aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7685)|
| 2:08:11| and you got to your last month. So that means really the heavy lifting needs to be done by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| September. So that's a great point, and I'll make that adjustment. One other just note to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| within our charter and how it's laid out is essentially the way we're structured now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| approximately, it's equally divided. We have, you know, it's approximately 50,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7707)|
| 2:08:34| but that was, of course, the last time the census was. So as things grow, so shall the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| apportionment across the thing. I saw Commissioner Bussler and then Commissioner Smith. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| Bussler? You are on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7725)|
| 2:08:55| Sorry, I thought it was unmuted. One thing you want to remember as a commissioner in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| you do have equal representation with the nine districts that we do have. And you all know your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7741)|
| 2:09:08| districts, you know where the lines are, you know where the future developments are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| you know how your district is growing since you've been in your district so long. And people expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7752)|
| 2:09:21| you to protect their voting districts. And in the past, when we did the redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7761)|
| 2:09:29| and there were some people that weren't voting in the same district that had been voted in for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| because we had to make the lines different to give them equal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| And the commissioners in those districts that are going to be affected the most must get their people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7778)|
| 2:09:47| to buy into it is one person, one vote. And so every commissioner in those nine districts should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| be on that committee, because they know their district, you travel it every day, and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| specific to those people. So remember that when you're looking and traveling through yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| and you get on this committee, that you're going to do the best you can, but you got to let people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| know that the people that are on the fringe or the edges of for these lines are going to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7810)|
| 2:10:18| But they may be in another district. And some people can't accept it. And some people will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7818)|
| 2:10:24| not accept it. So just be that and make sure that we're going to be salesmen out there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| about the decisions we're going to have to make. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| Thank you very much. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I had a couple of things I wanted to point out. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7837)|
| 2:10:43| actually, Commissioner Hill brought up a subject that I was going to broach in some respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7843)|
| 2:10:52| I don't believe our charter nor state statute, Mr. Law Director, requires our school zones and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| our commission districts to line up, do they? That's correct. They do not require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7859)|
| 2:11:08| Okay. And as Commissioner Hill was explaining, it is very difficult to get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7868)|
| 2:11:16| school districts to encompass the proportionately needed amount of people to be legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7876)|
| 2:11:25| and get those school zones where everybody in the community is going to a school within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7885)|
| 2:11:32| their zone. I know Bearden High School is in the third district. It's on the northern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7892)|
| 2:11:38| I mean, the southern edge of the third district and probably fully half of the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7898)|
| 2:11:46| go to Bearden do not live in the third district. And I know that happens in several places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| I also wanted to ask, our health department is extremely busy right now. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7912)|
| 2:12:01| including taking away somebody's time over there to participate in this fully on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7921)|
| 2:12:09| is the best use of their time right now. It might be just have them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| report data to the committee or testify before the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| Also, the two, our two at large commissioners both may be seeking reelection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7937)|
| 2:12:26| soon. So, before you two commit to this, will you all have time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7946)|
| 2:12:37| And that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| Okay. Director Booth, did you want to chime back in or did you just have your hand up from before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| I never took my hand down. Let me do that. There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| Additional thoughts on redistricting? Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7971)|
| 2:13:02| I think we should just sit here and see how long it takes for him to realize he's on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| Thank you, Chairman Jay. Now it's getting to the end of the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| But my thought was that some commissioners may not want to serve on this committee just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=7993)|
| 2:13:23| of the amount of time that's going to have to be invested in this committee to make sure everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8003)|
| 2:13:29| works out. So, you know, just I was just kicking it around over the weekend. I thought maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8009)|
| 2:13:36| seven or nine of the 11 commissioners might want to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| plus the chairman of the Knox County School Board, and of course, the director, the executive or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8021)|
| 2:13:50| elections administrator for Knox County as well. So, you'd have a committee of either nine or 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8030)|
| 2:13:57| And again, I don't see the need for the, say, KGIS because all of the data will be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8037)|
| 2:14:05| by the state and the federal government. So, we'll have all of the breakdown of men, women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8045)|
| 2:14:12| children, the whole thing. And so, again, that's just my thought. We can decide next week how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8052)|
| 2:14:21| proceed. But I do think we really need, because it's two readings, I think we need to have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8061)|
