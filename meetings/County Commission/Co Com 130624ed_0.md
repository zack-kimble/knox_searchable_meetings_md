| 0:02:38| Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| One Stop 9915 Thorn Grove Pike, Gulshan, USA, Inc., owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| First offense occurred April 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| Okay, is the owner present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Will you come forward, sir, and give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| Hi, my name is Riyaz Khairani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| I'm the owner of One Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| The address is 9915 Thorn Grove Pike, Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Yes, your name again is what, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Your name again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| Riyaz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Riyaz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| R-I-Y-A-Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| The procedure here today is that we're going to listen to the facts from the Knox County Sheriff's Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| the allegations against your store and your operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| After the officer is through, you'll have an opportunity to address this board with your side of the story, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| and then it will be up to this beer board to determine the resolution to this issue, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| So if you'll just have a seat right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| I'm going to ask Wolfie May, if he will, to come and bring testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=243)|
| 0:04:19| Alan Wolfie May, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| On May 23, 2013, I sent an underage person in to the One Stop 9915 Thorn Grove Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=263)|
| 0:04:33| and they purchased a six-pack of Bud Light Lime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| Wolfie, is this a responsible vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| At the time of when the officer sent the underage person in there, our clerk at the register, he did go through the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=293)|
| 0:05:08| looked at the year that was required, which was in line, but was not able to get the month on the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=308)|
| 0:05:22| and that was the reason he could not detect the date on the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=322)|
| 0:05:32| Do you have anything else to add before I turn it over to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Also, we were required to attend beer classes, which he already went ahead and got the classes taken care of as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=336)|
| 0:05:49| and the Sheriff's Department had also asked for another separate hearing on the 1st of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=349)|
| 0:05:58| for which we requested we were going to have an attorney come with us on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| Yes, that will be the criminal side of the issue, I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| If you have nothing else, Wolfie, did you have something you wanted to bring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| I'd be more than happy to pass around the driver's license that my underage used, and it shows everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| It's very readable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Anything else to come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Okay, can we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Before I make a motion, sir, were you the owner of this establishment in April of 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| Yes, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| So this is your second offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Yes, it's been a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| You know, one time, shame on you, shame on us if we let, you know, things go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| Mr. Chairman, I would make a motion for $1,000 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=435)|

| 0:07:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| What is your preference, sir, $1,000 fine or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=446)|

| 0:08:32| On May 23, 2013, I sent an underage person in to the Horner Market, 7512 Sevierville Pike, and bought a six-pack Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=512)|
| 0:08:49| I'm there seven days a week, 15 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| And at the time, I just had the state inspecting my gas pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| So I let the cook just handle this for five minutes, and she made the wrong decision, and I have to take responsibility for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=541)|
| 0:09:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| The next time something like this happens, I have to lock the door and let anybody run the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| I mean, I've been in this business 20 years, never had a violation, and I'm sorry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=557)|

| 0:09:39| Sir, how long have you had possession of this market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Because it's turned over about four or five times in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| I hope you don't compare me to the guys that were before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| It took me three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| I've been working seven days a week, 15 hours a day to rebuild the reputation of this place from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=590)|

| 0:24:22| for the particular location at 10636 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Have any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| transportation of intoxicating liquors or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| There is an outstanding license also at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| It will have to be surrendered and your certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1488)|

| 0:26:38| Thank you, Mr. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| We'll be asking the same similar questions that you've heard before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| Now, this will be concerning a special event, and it will be in a particular park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| The people that are going to be at this event serving alcohol, have any of these people ever been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture, transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| or other intoxicating liquors or crimes involving moral turpitude in the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| This will be for on premises for a specific period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| And who exactly is going to be operating this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| It will be City View Publishing, and I'll be there in charge of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Are you familiar with the laws of Knox County, Tennessee regulating beer, and do you agree to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| conduct your business in conformity with them on this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Has your people received beer training service program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Everybody serving will have a current permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Make the codes a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Rerun that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| It's just like the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| This property is in an agricultural zone, and by the zoning ordinance, beer sales are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| not allowed in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| The issue with this property is that it's not an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| This property is in an agricultural zone, and by the zoning ordinance, beer sales are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| not allowed in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| The issue at hand, there is an exception in this case under codes where you're allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| to have beer sales within a park, and I'm going to, depending upon your all's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| or disapproval on this temporary permit, the service area will have to be delimited by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| Doug Battelle on this occasion within the park, just as it would for our restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| in the park, our golf courses, and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| So under code 27-97, it is permissible over the agricultural limit in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1735)|
| 0:29:06| So it's entirely up to this body as to whether this special event goes through, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| do, once again, I'll address the applicant about how they have to get boundary limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| Is this a one-day event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| It's a benefit for Fort Loudon Lake Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Will you state the date for this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| July 20th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Do we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Mr. Sparks, what's your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| I mean, this is going to be a wide-open site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| And, Doug, if you don't care to come down, what's your plan for fencing or the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| I mean, what part of the park are you going to have this in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| I assume we'll have the sales directly behind the existing structure, which is occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| by River Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| And what's your plan about keeping that alcohol inside that vicinity, the fenced-off area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| I guess, Wolf, are you going to make them put cattle gates up or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| What's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Do we have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| So you didn't know where they were having the, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Doug, I want to encourage you, through working some of these events on Market Square and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| things like that, we need to make sure that this is somehow roped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| It's not cattle gate or orange, you know, the barricade tape or the orange construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| fencing or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| They need to make sure that either an officer is there or a reasonable, if it's a volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| that he's liable if that alcohol leaves that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| And the people that leave that area with that alcohol can be cited for possession of alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| inside a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| And so it needs to be very strict as we move forward with these special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I think it's a wonderful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| But he needs to be extra cautious of what we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| And in this case, too, we're looking at the policies and procedures that World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| and Market Square uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| And I think if this moves forward, we'll adapt some of those very same procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| It makes better sense for somebody to be checking IDs and handing out wristbands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| and making sure that the people that are getting the alcohol need to get the alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and even make sure possibly that there's deputies involved, that there's no underage consumption there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| That's an open entertainment venue, and it's hard to police it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And they need to make sure that the liability that comes with this great event is his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Have we done this before on county, at a county park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Not as a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| We've got beer permits at Three Ridges and at Lakeside Tavern at Concord Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| So certainly not without precedent, but this will be the first time we've done an event like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| We've had a lot of requests for this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| So, you know, we would like to try this, give it as a test balloon, see the policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Again, when you look at Market Square and World's Fair Park, obviously it's done all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| As long as it's managed properly, it works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| We do have a lot of requests from non-profit fundraisers for this type of event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| So I think the challenge for us will be coming up with a good policy to manage it properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| and make sure that all the checks and balances are in place, as Commissioner Anders indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| That's what I was going to ask is because a lot of people would be interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| now that we have, if we approve this, we're kind of opening up the floodgates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| because you're going to be getting a lot of people that says, okay, I want to do an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| and I want to be able to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Now, there will be no mixed drinks or anything, just beer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| How many people do we expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Well, I could say from like the Dragon Boat Race, we probably had 1,000 to 2,000 people there this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| So I know that the Sheriff's Department likes to have X number of deputies per people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| So you'll need to, I mean, that's all part of the expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| and the cost is to make sure that they're properly, that it's done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| I agree with Commissioner Anders having done a lot of these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| You definitely need to have some type of garden area that is roped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| And who's going to be doing the serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| That will be Neil Young, Neil's group at All Occasion Catering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| So he's, so he'll bring his people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| So you're not using a non-profit group to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| All professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| And Mr. Law Director, if there is, since this is on county property, if something happens there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| what liability do we have as Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| We would always be exposed for anything in Knox County in terms of negligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| just like they would if they were playing golf or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| It wouldn't be anything extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Now, the people, in terms of any violations related to alcohol, would be, would fall back upon City View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| the person holding the particular license to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| But, of course, any time anything happens on Knox County, if it's whoever is the real issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| it would fall upon Knox County as the one probably being the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| So I'm sure that as part of the agreement, they have signed an agreement saying that they're liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| And I'm sure that they have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Do you have insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| How much is the insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Two million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| You know, I'm a proponent of these types of events, primarily because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| as we talked about last week and we'll talk about some, I think our nonprofits are going to have to start looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| at alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| They're not going to be able to go to Big Brother with a checkbook and say, mother, father, may I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| So, you know, I'm in favor of these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| I'm in favor of we have some beautiful parks, beautiful park settings for concerts, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| And, you know, it is nice to be able to partake in a duck beverage as you enjoy the sights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| and sounds at specialized occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| But, you know, I agree with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And, you know, as long as we understand that we're not reinventing wheels anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| The city does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| There's other counties that do it if we're looking for more rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| So I know Doug is highly keen to his, you know, brethren across the state and the region as to what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2102)|
| 0:35:12| But I like the fact that we're kind of moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| We're going to be very cautious, but I'd just like to voice my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| You know, we don't want one every week, but, you know, occasional big events like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| I think is a good thing for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| One question for Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Doug, who makes the decision that it's okay to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Is it you or is there a party committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| Well, I think really within our code specific to Parks and Recreation, we have this ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| The language is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| So it is a policy issue for us as well as commission you voting today on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Again, I would look at this as a good test case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| We are getting more and more requests for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| And I'd absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| I think perhaps one of these per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| And we've always tried to manage, especially the Cove that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| that we don't have a huge event every weekend where the general public can't enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| So I think it would probably be a policy for us to look at one event like this for a month so that we keep it manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Well, I'm glad you've given this gentleman a try and hope he's successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| It's Fort Loudoun Lake Association is the beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Mr. Patel, just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Can you remember the last time there was a request similar to this and it was declined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| It was at least ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| Or a military softball tournament that wanted to come to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| One final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Mr. Chairman, is this Mr. Brown, is this Mr. Brown and I went to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| Is this the ones who cleaned up the river, take the stumps out and all those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| They do a fantastic job with it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| I mean, I had attended a meeting here a couple of months ago with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| Down on the river, you and I did down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| But there's a tremendous amount thrown in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| The stumps and the plastic bottles and all this debris that eventually goes to the dam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| you take that out, I guess, along the Knox County and Blount County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Yes, they do do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| And our goal here at City View is to give them exposure for what they do to help them raise money to continue their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, for interrupting, but that's all he does every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| He gets in that little boat and goes up and down the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| and they have a bunch of pictures down there showing how much stuff he gets just on one run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| And it's amazing, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I mean, it needs a lot of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| We've got a motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Go ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Doug and Nathan, I appreciate what you're doing behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| But does Knox County get anything out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Are they making a donation to Knox County Parks and Recreation for this, or are we renting any property or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| Essentially, on cases like this, just like the dragon boat race last weekend, I think they raised, gosh, a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| Two hundred and fifty-one thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| We basically just try to recoup our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Typically, we'll have a little additional staff, some cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And we essentially charge for whatever additional cost to the Parks Department there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| I have the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I wish you the best with your event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2324)|

| 0:39:13| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Mr. Patel, I'm going to ask you a series of questions you've probably heard before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| We're talking about the location of 5904 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquors or crimes against moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| Has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| To my knowledge, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| And this is for off premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| And who will operate this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2400)|

| 0:40:09| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2409)|

| 0:40:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| You have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Discussion and possible action regarding a grace period for beer permit holders to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| and make available for inspection the executed criminal penalties acknowledgement form from employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| serving and or selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| This is just this item that we've been discussing and just wanted to see if it's agreeable to Captain Mays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| and to the board that there is a grace period in terms of this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| something and I was thinking in terms of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| So you might want to respond to that, Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Would 60 days grace period be okay for conforming to this additional requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2485)|
| 0:41:38| Are you asking just about the form that the employee signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Or about the ability of myself or officers to be able to inspect the form and the server ID cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2504)|
| 0:41:54| Well, I'm talking about before you would feel like they were out of compliance to give them a grace period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2514)|
| 0:42:04| on the form that they're signing for these that delineates what these criminal penalties possibly could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2524)|
| 0:42:14| The store would be up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| If I go in and purchase alcohol, I would have to cite that person that was selling the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| But you all could do the 60 day, I guess, on the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| On the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| But, I mean, if someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| No, I'm not saying stop citing them on the sale, but just on the letter, just on the signature on the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2557)|
| 0:42:46| As long as I had access within 60 days, I would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| That would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Any other discussion about that, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Are we going to notify by letter each permit holder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| A lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| A hundred and forty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2585)|
| 0:43:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Do we have any other items before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| This is something you'll bring back next month with a resolution then or you want a motion today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| We have a motion to recommend it to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| We're going to have an ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| We're going to have an ordinance here pretty soon, so we probably need a recommendation from this board to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| directing, you know, a 60 day waiver on the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2627)|
| 0:43:57| Could you not just make it an effective date like January 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| That they all have to be in compliance by November 1 or something like that in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Do we need to authorize that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I think it would be better to have something official because you're going to have an ordinance outstanding that a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| officer is going to have to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And from a legal standpoint, if we had a resolution implementing that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| the punishment of that piece down the road, it might make it a little better on people who are trying to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| I'll make that motion then that that be included in your ordinance coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| And a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| A resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| We have a motion to include that in a resolution for 60 days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| When we say October 1, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| October 1 will give us a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| There's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Is that a criminal or is that a civil matter within the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| Civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| When you said ordinance, I was making sure it's a civil matter on the store side for not completing the forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| And do we hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| So that would be September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| All in favor say aye as a recommendation to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| We said October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Any further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Let's break for ten minutes and then we'll start up with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| To order, please have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| I have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Commissioners, would you please have a seat and we'll enter into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2749)|
| 0:46:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| First that I have here on public forum is Tim Howell from Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| Is Mr. Howell here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Thank you, Mr. Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Will you come forward, give your name and address, and you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| My name is Tim Howell and I live at 6853 Fraker Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Go ahead, Mr. Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| I'm here to talk to you a little bit and educate you a little bit about a, I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| you'd call it a promise or a pledge, but it goes back to when Mayor Ragsdale was the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| of the county and he had made a $3 million pledge on a building that we were building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| at that time, our facility, and it was a matching grant for us to raise another $3 million and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| construct our corporate headquarters for our 501C3 agency and an assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| And we had been paid on that $3 million after this year with the defined services contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| $2,478,410, leaving a balance of $521,590.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2848)|
| 0:47:37| And I've been up here and spoke to you all several times about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| And I went and the other day at the South Knoxville town hall meeting, I went and talked to Mayor Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| and at that time told him some of the challenges that the agency has gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| And along those lines, we are, this year is the year that we are putting, we are having to pay back the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| on the note that we have with this balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| And we would hope that something could be done to pay part of this money on the pledge that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| so that we can begin to pay back the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| We've signed the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| We've been interest only on that since the building has been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| And the agency, we feel like we're doing everything that we said we would do when we built the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| We're offering affordable assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| We've got great homemaker programs here in the county, helping the elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| giving them affordable services, and persons with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| So we would like to ask or I would like to ask for your support that we can continue to get this pledge paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| so that the agency can be in better financial shape in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| That is really what I came to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| And I also came to give you all an invitation to come eat lunch with us on July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| I don't know if all of you have been in our building, but I think Commissioner Burrell has helped hand those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| And so you all have been given that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| We would love for you to come down and see the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I know that some of you have been in it, but at least see the work that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| and how we go about helping the people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| We've got, at this time, somewhere around 150 people that we employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| And about 25 of them directly work inside the building as far as providing the assisted living services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| So not only it created some great jobs for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| I know when we opened the building up, some of those folks had skills that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| and they came right off the unemployment line and came into our building and worked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And so we were very grateful to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| So I think in a lot of ways, not only are we offering affordable housing, but we're offering great jobs to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| And, again, we just feel like we have lived up to our part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| And, again, very thankful to the county for the money that we have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| because it has helped us do a lot of things in support and taking care of the elderly here in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| But we would surely love to get this other $500,000 so we can pay it on the note that we've got with the bank at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| Do you all have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| I hope I can see you on July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Yeah, we do have a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Is there anything else that you'd like to say, Mr. Howell, right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| No, other than come see our building and learn more about what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Yes, Tim, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| How many people do you service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| How many clients do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Our agency and all the programs will serve somewhere around 2,600 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| In Knox County alone, that will probably be somewhere around 800 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| And inside the building, we usually run around 60 residents that will live there in a year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| So you're kind of regional, not just Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| We're in 20 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Now, the 521-590, is that as of June 30th, or will you be making any kind of principal payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| The 521-590 is of the $3 million that was pledged to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| That's what's left from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Oh, so that's the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Okay, other questions for Mr. Howell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| Okay, certainly we're in the throes of what to do with budget still through August, Mr. Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| So it will be in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| And we appreciate you coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| We do take seriously pledges of honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| So thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| Next on the forum is Jerry Borse from the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you, Mr. Borse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| State your name again and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| My name is Jerry Borse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| I live at 7914 Gleason Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| And the complex is referred to as the Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| It's a Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And I thank you in advance for this privilege of coming here and talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| I'd like to make mention of, first of all, we have 178 living units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3121)|
| 0:52:10| The population there is in excess of 200 people, most of whom are senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3130)|
| 0:52:19| And what I would like to ask you for your advice, perhaps recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| is our concern about the county and city taxes that we pay and the services that we get for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3146)|
| 0:52:39| And we get five wonderful services that we couldn't do without, fire protection, police protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| trash pickup, brush pickup, and a wonderful school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| We have been told in the past that when we pay our property taxes, services are rendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| And we asked in the past for help on certain things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| These subdivisions in the surrounding area receive many more services than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3183)|
| 0:53:11| But we also were told that the way their properties were appraised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| and the subsequent assessment is exactly the way they appraised my condominium at the Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3198)|
| 0:53:31| But in addition to the five services that we receive, just to name a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| these subdivisions get paving, curbing, street lighting, snow and ice treatment, fire hydrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3218)|
| 0:53:47| speed bumps, signage like stop signs, yield signs, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| And it sounds miscellaneous, but they get leaf pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| We're not entitled to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| We were told that because we are a homeowner's association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| there are certain things that we have to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| And we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| And we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| And the way we get these things that we don't have, we have a monthly dues of $160 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| Twenty to 25% of that goes into a fund to get these services, snow removal, ice removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3259)|
| 0:54:29| signage, paving, curbing, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Apparently our roadways don't meet city code, so they can't help us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| From 2003 until this year, we have spent $213,000 on road repair, pavings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3278)|
| 0:54:48| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| What we're asking is, is there any possibility for the taxes that we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| and this additional cost, this additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| In order to get these additional things, we have that $160 and the percent it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| That amounts to approximately $350 to $450 a year per homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3308)|
| 0:55:18| And that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| We're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| But I'm here today to ask you, is there any suggestions you have that would offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| some of those expenses so that we can continue to obtain them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3328)|
| 0:55:38| Perhaps maybe our appraisal could be lowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| Call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| I know you have commercial, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| Call us private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| And then you have the appraisal and the subsequent assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| Could the dollars and cents per hundred of assessment be somehow adjusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| for private property to offset some of these expenses that we pay for extra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3362)|
| 0:56:12| And thank you very much for this privilege to talk with you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Thank you, Mr. Borson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| That is an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Mr. Smith's got a --I know we've got a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| So Mr. Smith's got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Jerry, just real quick, are you in the city or are you in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Where are you located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Are you inside the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| We're both city and county taxes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| That would be city county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| You've really got city council issues is what you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| Somewhere along the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| I mean, I know you pay county taxes, but the paving would be the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| I guess we were saying, is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| You know, our neighbor across the street gets 15 services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| We get five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| We're pleased with the five we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| We were just wondering, is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| We don't do that in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| In the county, we have no leaf pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Believe me, I'd be using it if they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| There's no garbage pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| No lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| Well, I lived for 15-plus years in Kingston Woods, right across Kendall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| Road from where I live now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I've lived in the meadows for the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| And as I go through that subdivision, they've got wonderful sodium lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| for their streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| They get paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Well, all these things I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| And I was told somewhere along the line, and I think it was at one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| equalization meetings that they hold, that I mentioned this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| And one of the gentlemen on that group said, when you choose to live in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3472)|
| 0:58:01| homeowners association, you give up certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| And I guess these services are what we give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| And that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| We can pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| We were just wondering, is there any adjustment that could be made to offset that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| You might ask to be de-annexed, if that will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| But these are city issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| You need to go before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| City council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Or go to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| She's real friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| They'd be happy to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| Somewhere along the line in the property assessor's office, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| oh, you need to see the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| They set those rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| There's a couple more questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| Mr. Boyce, there are observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Mr. Weaver, can you come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Can you come up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| And I guess the main question is, if this is a homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| private roads, private everything, is it assessed different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| Do they have a lower property value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| I know it's the same per hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| But if it's 1,500 square feet versus 1,500 square feet somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| got a proper road and all that, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Brad, it would still be assessed based on the sales information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| just like we would any other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| So it's not necessarily sales inside that condo development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| but maybe sales down the road a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| We would try to look at sales within that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| But, of course, we would compare it with other condo developments also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Jim, identify yourself for the people on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Jim Weaver, 400 Main Street, Knox County Property Assessor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| So it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| They're not treated any different such as, like, Cherokee Bluff and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| They have their own homeowners and their own street paving and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| They're all assessed the same as 1,500 square feet there as 1,500 square feet somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| It's based on sales information, based on what the property is selling for, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| We do nothing different there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| I think that's the real question is if there's a legal way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| or if there's a right way to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Because the only reason you're not there is because you didn't build your roads to city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| and county specs whenever you built or they built the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| And that makes it tough because everything in there is private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| And so the homeowners association has taken it upon themselves to take care of all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| But I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| I understand and agree with your argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| I think that would be a long process to maybe possibly change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| I think that's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| But I think it's worth studying a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| If it would be easier to make an adjustment somewhere along the line as the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| and cents per hundred of a cent or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Well, we couldn't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| But the value of the condo, you should be able to sell yours at less value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| because you do not get those services in your taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Then a guy down the road from you on another complex that gets those services from the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| I did have the pleasure to visit with Mr. Ballard in the assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| And that was one question I asked him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| I said, I lived for 15 plus years in Kingston Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| Now I moved across the street to the Meadows condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| Did you appraise my house in Kingston Woods with the same procedure, the same formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| as you appraised my condominium across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| One word answer, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| I don't have an answer for you, but it's very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Well, thank you, Mr. Bors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I think it is worthy of further consideration either through the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| and also through city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| And so it's one of those issues that you might stay after and find some traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Mr. Bors, I was, I don't know if you recall, I was out at your homeowner's meeting probably two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| I think at the invitation of Nancy Walls and Mr. Dolanak, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| And it's a quandary, you know, that you pay, you're responsible for, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| for the street lighting, which the city normally pays for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| and paving the roads, which the city normally pays for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And your question to me, as I recall it, was how can you get an adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| because of the things you're paying for that 98% of the citizens of Knox County are paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3733)|
| 1:02:21| these items are paid for through their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| And it's, I don't know where it can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| I mean, it's, there are other things that you mentioned that you do get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| that you don't necessarily see from, the only thing that I think you related that you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| from your county dollars is a school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| There are other things you would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| They're sort of invisible and they're smaller unless you're directly dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| a health department, an air quality department, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| there are parks and things beyond the city limits that you pay for with your county dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| But I remember discussing it with the law director, it was Joe Jarrett then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| and it's a quandary that I don't know if it can be resolved on the local level or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| It's just, you know, it's a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| There is some inequalities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| I know it was brought up to our attention when in a conversation one time they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| well, do you drive up Clinton Highway, Kingston Pike, Gallaher View?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Well, that's part of the tax money there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Well, so do the people in the subdivision have that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| I'm glad you were able to, you brought this back to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| and my colleagues were able to hear this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Because I certainly didn't have an answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| I understand the inequality, but I don't have the way to resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Thank you, Mr. Borth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Thank you for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| The next person signed up for forum is Tom Driscoll Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Amy, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| It's not a question for Mr. Borth, but this is, if it were to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| I would assume it would have to be addressed by city and county at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| But is this something that our law department could maybe do some research on for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| on it for us and see if what the hurdles would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| Is this something that has to be done at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| or is there anything that can happen at the local level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| Could you just look into that for us and let us know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Yeah, we can look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| The current situation that he finds himself though is more city policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| He's getting every bit of the service for his tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| for our county tax dollars that's available to everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| The appraisals are done and set the way appraisals are done and set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| And that would come out of the comptroller in the state level for those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| I mean, I can tell you that sitting right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| The issues that I hear him talking about is policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| whether the city will take a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| If they don't take a street, then they don't get the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| They don't get certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| I don't know about the leaf pickup, why they don't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| But that's, you know, that's city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| But I'll be glad to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| But it sounds like, though, that his problem is a city problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| It's not a county problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3916)|
| 1:05:33| The next person on public forum is Tom Driscoll, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3939)|

| 1:05:41| Driscoll here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3941)|
| 1:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Well, without objection, we'll move on into our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| That's all right with the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Madam Clerk, would you call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=3961)|

| 1:06:55| ask a blessing on a sacred service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| Specifically, we ask for wisdom and clarity, a vision for our leaders that they seek and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| discover the greatest good for all as they conduct even the most mundane everyday chores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| in the service to a people, to all persons in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4032)|

| 1:07:23| and willingness of heart to cooperate for the greatest good of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| And we ask especially, holy one, for a blessing on the land that we are all called to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| That we, in turn, hold with respect the gift you have given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| Give us the courage to protect the ecosystem and every wild creature that uses the beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| of this unique area for their home, indeed, for their very lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4066)|

| 1:07:56| faith in this area of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4076)|

| 1:08:21| of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4101)|

| 1:08:34| You will stand and give appropriate salute to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4114)|

| 1:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4143)|

| 1:09:11| censure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| We had a miscount of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| It was changed from eight to seven ayes and one no, two abstentions instead of one, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4154)|
| 1:09:26| one person was absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| Can I hear a motion to accept the sum of minutes in that change in count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4175)|

| 1:09:44| Can we hear amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4184)|
| 1:09:52| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| I'd like to remove from consent Item 904 on page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4193)|

| 1:10:00| It will be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4200)|

| 1:10:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I'd like to have us have three discussion items if we have time before zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| Items that I would like to hear a little discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| Commission lunch, the joint committee of school board and commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4215)|
| 1:10:24| and then I believe the railroad committee met today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Would you be prepared to entertain a railroad question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| We'll add those to our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Any other amendments from the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Sheriff Jones, you have an addition or mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| Tim Burch at 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| We would like to add $60,000 for a sexual assault nurse examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4252)|
| 1:11:02| The same nurse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Same nurses from the crisis center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| The same nurse for the crisis center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Not to be confused with the insane nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| So we're just trying to get the money in the budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| From what I understand, the sexual assault crisis center is needing this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4275)|
| 1:11:24| They've run into a little bit of a rough patch, but this will get them through the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| and this will also, yeah, it's a one-time, according to Chris Collway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| it'll be a one-time defined service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| And we'd like, and the sheriff's up here answering questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| but the name is pretty self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| I'm going to make a motion we add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| It'll be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4313)|

| 1:12:01| We hear a motion to add, defer, withdraw, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4326)|

| 1:12:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Drives and roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| We have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4336)|

| 1:12:46| Before the reading of consent, Mr. Majors, would you like to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| and comment on our appointment of our magistrates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| And then following Mr. Majors' comments there, Judge Emory is going to swear in our magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4380)|
| 1:13:11| Go ahead, Mr. Majors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Richard Major, 11406 Oxford Station Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| I just want to take the opportunity to thank each and every one of you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| to once again serve the citizens of this county as their magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| It's been a pleasure to do this for the past seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| I look forward to continuing to serve our courts for the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| I know we've not taken our vote on consent yet, so I hope I don't have the cart before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| the horse yet, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| But presuming we do approve the consent agenda and I am reappointed, I do want to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| for, again, trusting this task to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4422)|

| 1:13:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Very briefly, Robert Cole, 2313 Pulaski Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| I saw a commercial on TV not too long ago that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| If you love your job, you'll never work a day in your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| And I've barely hit a lick in the last four years while I've been acting as a judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| And I look forward to several more years working for the county, serving in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| And I'm a firm believer in Murphy's Law, so I'm just kind of crossing my fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4466)|

| 1:14:31| Judge, would you or are you prepared to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| I do think we need to vote before we swear in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Let's have a vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| I was going to save them that from the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4484)|

| 1:14:48| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Are we pulling this item from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Right now you're voting for the whole consent item, the whole consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| So we need to probably make a motion to pull it from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=4496)|

| 1:30:32| Can I hear a motion to approve consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Okay, all in favor, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Mr. Chairman, can I ask Dr. McIntyre one question before we move on about one of those that was on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| I mean, I'm not trying to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| I'd just like a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Dr. McIntyre, would you be so kind as to just help us with one of the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5457)|
| 1:31:06| I'll probably guess which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| I'd just like you to let us know what the difference between a $190 a day bus and a $357 a day bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5469)|
| 1:31:20| On the transportation, Jim McIntyre, 912 South Gate Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| superintendent of schools, there are different types of buses that we run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| and they may have different numbers of children on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| They may have a variable cost of providing that transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| We also provide, in certain circumstances, what are called shuttles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5496)|
| 1:31:43| which might serve only a student or two in a particular circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| So it really depends on the type of transportation that's provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| and the route that's provided and the contract that we have with the particular vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| But we obviously manage that on a route-by-route basis and on a vendor-by-vendor basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| to make sure that we get the best value in terms of the type of equipment that's on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5523)|
| 1:32:10| and the route that's run and what we pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| How do we stack up against a similar-sized school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5534)|
| 1:32:21| percentage of money spent for transportation versus total budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| Well, my main point of reference would be Boston, Massachusetts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| which is actually a similar-sized school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| We spend about $13 million on transportation here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| We spent about $80 million in Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| And there's some cost-of-living differences and some choice differences and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| But I would say on the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Aldro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Aldro snowplows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| You need snow tires on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| But I would say when we look at, even when we look at districts that are sort of in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| in Tennessee or in the southeast, we stack up very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| We have a very, I think, a very efficient model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| The fact that we use local vendors to provide service actually gives us enormous value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| And not only are they able to provide very good service at a good cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| I think they have a real stake in our community and our kids, and I think that makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| So I think our transportation program is very efficient, very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| And we certainly continue to look at the efficiency of our operation on a year-to-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| But I feel like we stack up very well against other similar-sized school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5619)|

| 1:35:24| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Mr. Weaver, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| All I wanted to do was offer the Property Assessor's Office time to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| Is there anything in this process that you've been through this time that you think has adjusted or you'd like the public to know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| I think basically the process has been smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| I have not gotten a lot of ñ I haven't gotten but just a few phone calls, and those are just of the normal sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| So just any comments that you've got overall or anything that you or Mr. Ballard would like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5759)|
| 1:36:08| Thank you, Commission, for allowing me at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| Again, say your name and address, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| Jim Weaver, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Thanks for allowing me just to briefly speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| I was really more prepared to talk about the resolution, but that's pretty generic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| It's not changed since 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| We think that the appeals process has gone fairly smooth this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| In 2009, on the last reappraisal, there was approximately 16,000 informal appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5797)|
| 1:36:44| We had about 7,500 this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| On the informal side, the county board is still meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| This is their last week to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| We have somewhere around 3,000 appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| Don't hold me to that plus or minus schedule for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| So, of course, the last day to be heard is Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| It's gone, I think, fairly smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| Of course, we have a few disgruntled people, but I think we worked through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5832)|
| 1:37:21| We do anticipate additional appeals going on to the state board as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| In the last reappraisal in 2009, we had about 600 or 700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| I would expect it to be somewhat less than that this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| So if you have any questions of me, I'll try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| I don't see any other lights up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| So we appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5868)|

| 1:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Ms. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| I wanted to make a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5899)|

| 1:38:25| I think there's a majority of people who want to do something right now until we do our meal-a-thon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5905)|
| 1:38:35| The best argument that I heard was that if we appropriate this much money now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| then it might be difficult for the meal-a-thon to be a true success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| And I think that's a great argument, and I agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| So I think appropriating just the amount to cover what's necessary between now and then is much more doable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5931)|
| 1:39:02| and won't put a damper on any fundraising efforts that we make during the meal-a-thon at the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5942)|
| 1:39:11| So the only problem I had with limiting it to the 113 people on the waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| is that I know that if we appropriate that money today, tomorrow there's going to be a new waiting list started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5957)|
| 1:39:24| because they're adding people two or three a week to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| So until we have our meal-a-thon, there will be another waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| So I'm looking for a collaboration for the other people who are interested in doing something for these seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5973)|
| 1:39:42| as to an appropriate amount that we should appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| So I had mentioned $35,000 as an amount that would take care of everyone on the waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| and any new ones that came in until we are able to have our meal-a-thon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| So I'd like to offer a substitute motion that we appropriate the $35,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| but if someone has another amount that they would like to throw out there, I'm certainly open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| We didn't get to have a very good discussion about amounts during our lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| I think it would probably be proper to say that you're amending your motion to say that now it's $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| That's the motion that you'd like to put before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| And if somebody's got a different amount that they would like to float, you know, I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| So our original motion now will be $35,000 for Meals on Wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| Mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| That's our mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| And I think, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| That's only for to cover anyone who's either on the waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| or would potentially be put on the waiting list until after the meal-a-thon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| And I think there may have been some people who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| Let's entertain our lights here first and then we'll allow people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| I just want to go over the numbers and make sure that I've got them right in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| One month is $7,721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| Two months would be $15,443.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| Three months would be $23,165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| And that is at the $113 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| So if the proposal is for $35,000, would that be for four months or three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Because that would still give you an additional $4,000 to take care of any overage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| I would be willing to go with the four-month figure at $35,000 as opposed to the three-month figure at $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| I just pulled my numbers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| You're going to have to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| The numbers that I have, and I got these from CAC directly, is one month at the $113 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| It would be $7,721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| The two-month would be $15,443.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Three months would be $23,165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| So if we do $35,000, I would be willing to go for a four-month that still gives you extra dollars to take care of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6115)|
| 1:42:04| It gives you an extra $4,000 to take care of any new people that would come on because we don't know what that number is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6124)|
| 1:42:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| So I would be, if you do four months, then otherwise I would like to go with the three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| and see what the Radiothon does at the $23,165, maybe make that up to $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| But I can go for $35,000 if it's four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| So they have up to four months to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| And if they don't, it goes back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| So if they need to use it up within three months, are you okay with that if the waiting list gets so much longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| Well, if they come back to us, I don't want to just open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| I mean, if they come back and say, hey, we've got these additional folks, I mean, communicate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Let us know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| And I'm sure that Mobile Meals would be fine with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| I mean, I can't speak for them directly, but I know they'll be grateful for any help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| And I have taken the comments, especially Brad, that you made about the CAC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6175)|
| 1:43:01| I agree with you on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| And that's something that I'm going to be working on going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| And maybe it's something that you and I can talk about later this week as far as what's happening with leadership in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6185)|
| 1:43:12| And the second agree is because, you know, with any telethon, there's going to be a lag in getting the funds in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| So I think four months makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| So, good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| So we put a time limit as well as a new number on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6207)|
| 1:43:34| As long as there are funds available to take care of anybody new who would come onto the waiting list, I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6214)|
| 1:43:42| And I think Mike has made that allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Oh, do you want somebody to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| There might have been people who took time out of their day to come down here and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| You know what they say about the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Once they sign the contract, don't keep talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| Well, thanks to everybody who came out to support this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| We did the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| Page 21-904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| Approving and supporting the continuing efforts of the Knox County Law Director in working with the Attorney General to attempt to recover public monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| alleged to have been misappropriated by employees of former Knox County Trustee Mike Lowe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| and requesting the Knox County Law Director to exercise all legal means available to recover public monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| alleged to have been misappropriated by former employees of Knox County Trustee Mike Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6284)|
| 1:44:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| The reason that I pulled this off consent was I wanted to put a little bit of a spotlight on it, to be quite frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| Since 2008, these things have been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| We know that there is one individual that has admitted to having taken over $100,000 of taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6304)|
| 1:45:12| and to this date not a penny has been paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| I've been working with our former law director, our current law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| and I want to say thank you to Mr. Armstrong because he's really Johnny on the spot on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| You would think that this would be an easy thing to do, but you're going through a legal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| you're going through an investigation process, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| However, I firmly believe that we are at the point to where we need to start getting our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| It's been five years, going on six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| There will be trials next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| There's more than one individual involved in this, but at least we know of one who has admitted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| and said, yes, I took the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| I want to know why monies haven't been paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| As far as any jail time, that's going to be up to other people to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| But I think we have an obligation to go after our money, and that's why I brought it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| That's why I wanted to put a little bit of a spotlight on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| because I think the public needs to know that we are going to go after our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| and I wanted to make sure that we all knew and that Mr. Armstrong has agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| that we will take whatever means necessary to get this money back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| That's really all I wanted to say about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| except that I just wanted to, again, put a little bit of spotlight on it to say I don't understand why it's taken five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| and nothing's been paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| I don't know if there's any kind of deals that have been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| Those are things I'd like to find out, and that's why I'm asking our law director to take any means necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| and report back to us and let us know what's going on, because I think the people need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Mr. Law Director, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| I agree 100 percent with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| There are some legal issues currently right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| We do have one particular individual, as Commissioner Hammond has stated, that has admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| The question now is, you know, do we get the whole dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| or do we get the dollars deducted because of federal tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| We can get some from a retirement account, and that's a substantial difference, 20 percent drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6432)|
| 1:47:20| So if we wait until everything is codified in terms of the criminal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| then we can get 100 percent and avoid the federal tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| If we go after it today, then we'd lose 20 percent of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| That's just legal issues we've got to work our way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| But I will be meeting with the attorney general on whatever he is willing to talk about, and we will be pursuing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6460)|
| 1:47:50| And I think next year things will be coming, maybe even before we can get this 100 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6470)|
| 1:47:58| on the one that's already ready to go, but they just don't have a trial date set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| Anyway, we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| Everybody is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Thank you, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| But is it better for the guy to go to court and have already paid his money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| Does the judge not look at that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| You're saying he does pay it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| Will he lose 20 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| It may be better for him, but it's not better for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| If he pays it now, then 20 percent goes to the federal withholding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| And if we wait until after all the legal work is done, we can get 100 percent without any withholding on federal tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| So on one of the issues, that's a substantial amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| I'm in a neighborhood of $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| So if we can wait a little while longer, I mean, since we've waited five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| we may be able to get back a pretty good lick without having to give part of it up to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| We employ a salary for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| I just had a question, and maybe I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| I'm aware of the one where the person has admitted that he took over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| And that's, you know, I think that's something we do need to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Based on some of the other individuals, have they said that they took money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| or is this still to be determined by the court just from what I've read in the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| I didn't think that they had admitted to anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| And can we go after money if they say they don't owe any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| Currently, we only have one that's willing to settle and admit wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| The rest of them is in the process that Commissioner Hammond mentioned next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| But immediately next year when those come to fruition, then we'll be in a position to go after the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| The civil part has to wait on the criminal part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6597)|

| 1:55:57| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| Direction or guidance or anything that the full Commission would like to send on its behalf to the committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6959)|
| 1:56:09| the joint committee meeting of the Board of Education and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6969)|
| 1:56:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| I'm getting messages from two directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| You know, I don't have anything to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| But maybe we could add on our agenda on the discussion section at the end of our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| just an update for the rest of us, you know, what all was discussed, what progress is being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| any problems that have come up, and if there's anything that we might need to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| contact any school board members that they may want to relate to us as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| In other words, what we're doing, because, I mean, this is, I think it's really an important committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| I mean, you know, we've talked about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| Two-thirds of our county budget is going to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| It's probably the biggest responsibility that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| And we spend a lot of time on a lot of other things, but there's probably nothing more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| And I think just knowing where we stand on, you know, where we stand, how the meeting's progressing, what's being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| And it doesn't have to be a long presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| It could be five or ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| Commissioner Briggs, last week at the workshop, we did exactly that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| and that's our commitment to this body, that we would cover the affairs of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7045)|
| 1:57:33| And so we covered that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| Maybe, I don't know if you want to do a recap, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Incomplete information here for Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| The committee met and had some things that they'd like to discuss at the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| My question is, is there anything coming from commission going toward the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| Because it's sort of the perception of are there issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| or items that should be discussed at that committee before they're discussed here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| So if you have something you'd like to see discussed here, do we need to send it there for discussion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| That's what I'm looking for is items of discussion to take to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| Yeah, and I'd say that I think that is the goal of the committee is to try to send things for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| not a decision-making body, but those things that we kind of know this may be controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| or look controversial that we as a body and they as a body say, well, let's send that to the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| just to give a flavor of how both bodies are thinking and we report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7115)|
| 1:58:42| Additionally, the minutes or the executive summary of our meetings are going to be sent to the committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| but copied to the whole commission and the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| And if you have comments on those, you can send directly back to Mr. Joyner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| What's the best way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| Because I do have something that I think would be worthy of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| I mean, should I send that as an e-mail to you all or to one of the committee members or mention it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| What should I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| I would see no problem in any of those avenues being taken because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| and I would not be deliberating on it, neither would we, you and I, even be discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7157)|
| 1:59:27| You're giving me a subject that you'd like to see discussed at that committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| so I believe that that could change hands in any venue, in any person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| The only reason I mention that, you know, it deals because we just deal with the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| They deal with the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| And, you know, one of the questions that I've had that I've had taxpayers ask me is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| we're giving so much money and it's to come back to us what the metrics are that we're using to measure progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7189)|
| 1:59:58| You know, they do have that, you know, 190, 90, 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| I mean, I have some real issues with that because some of that's not, you know, to me is not really measuring things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| But should we be using composite ACTs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| You know, in other words, if we put this much more money in it, how do we know we're making progress is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| And how do we know that the taxpayers are getting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| are getting their money's worth with some of the new policies that are approved by the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| where they're asking us for money to implement them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| And I think that the evaluation of those policies is probably beyond us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7230)|
| 2:00:36| I do notice the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| We're not evaluating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| I'm asking how are they doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| Because if they're coming up, as you said, if you'll give us an extra, you know, $40 million this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| what can we expect to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| What are we buying for our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Are we expecting to see, is the goal an improvement in ACT scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| Is it a goal to have more graduates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Is it, you know, I mean, what are we expecting to get for, what are we buying for our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| And how do we know that we're making progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| Valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| I'm asking, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| No, that's a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| I'm not telling them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| I'm just telling them how are they measuring progress when they come to ask for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| Most valid question, and I believe that the superintendent of schools is here to see us once a quarter to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7276)|
| 2:01:24| He will be here once a quarter to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| And that may be more appropriate for the school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| But I guess I would say, you know, when you look at the 100, you can agree or disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| But I do think it incorporates all those factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| It incorporates not only completion, it does incorporate the ACT score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7298)|
| 2:01:45| And if you look at the goal of the ACT score and where we are today, I think it's a leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| I think it's a leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Now, I don't know if it's linear if we give, you know, per million dollars do we get, you know, a point on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7311)|
| 2:01:58| I don't think anyone can ever necessarily define it that discreetly, you know, because the human mind doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| The reason I say that is that 190, 90, 90, three of the four, to me, don't mean, I mean, say they get 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| get some sort of diploma, but it doesn't mean that the diplomas are worth anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| It says that 90% of the people take the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| That doesn't show any educational progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| Yeah, but if you mix that with the common core and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| No, the one does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| But there's only one of four that have, to me, that has any meaning of academic progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| And I think a diploma being issued by the state of Tennessee probably meets certain criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| You know, and, again, that's not for us to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| But that's a true statement of what Commissioner Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| And, also, there are increasing, you know, the rigor, the academic rigor within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| So, you know, it's not a, I'm just trying to think if that's something that we would actually debate in that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7371)|
| 2:03:00| I think that is more appropriate to have a conversation with the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| What metrics are we using?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| I didn't say that, but if we're using these metrics and we're seeing we're putting money into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| and we're going in the wrong direction, are you making progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| And you're not making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| Is, you know, is it valid for us just to keep pouring more money into something where we're not improving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| Now that I've played devil's advocate on all of your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| I'm going to pile on your side and say that I believe that we, sitting here as Knox County Commission, are caught in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7407)|
| 2:03:34| I was going to remark a few minutes ago that I believe it's in the press that where Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7414)|
| 2:03:44| whether the literature was appropriate or not at Hardin Valley Academy during one summer program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| whether that literature being prescribed reading for the summer was appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| I believe the state has taken that up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| And that's where the policy comes from, from the state of Tennessee, about how the school system operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7439)|
| 2:04:06| So I believe that we are a conduit between what our local district would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| and what we would like to see our state legislators formulate for the operation of school districts in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7451)|
| 2:04:19| That's appropriately our task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| So if we've got questions, we can go two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| We can go to the school district and ask, and we can also ask of our state legislative delegation those same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7466)|
| 2:04:36| Us here, this seated body, not really having any control over anything except the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7476)|
| 2:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| So back to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| If you have an issue that you would like to see addressed by this small joint committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7493)|
| 2:05:00| please feel free to address me with it and I'll make sure it gets on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| maybe a few months before we get to it because we plow very slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| But we do address issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| And when is the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| July the 11th at 430, 430 to 6, over in A.J. Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Other things related to the educational discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| We need to back up one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Let's finish the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Oh, did you have something else to educate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| I'm sorry to get this on the agenda, but, J.J., could you come forward for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| We've talked several times about the safety center, but you all get the report just like from Richard, like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7548)|
| 2:05:55| If you notice this month, there was a big jump in the number of inmates that he's holding out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| I don't know how many more he can take, and, you know, it's becoming a real serious problem for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7561)|
| 2:06:08| Have you had any recent discussions with the city in regards to going ahead with this, J.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7568)|
| 2:06:15| Not really with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| There have been some more developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Helen Ross McNabb has been the only person that has been interested in doing the safety center with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| and they have acquired a building and a piece of property next to the now what we're using as a crisis stabilization unit on Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7585)|
| 2:06:34| So now this building that they acquired is right next door to the crisis stabilization unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| which would mean that if we used this building that they have acquired, we wouldn't have to fill the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7600)|
| 2:06:46| It would already be there, and we would have to renovate it, which would cost much less to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| And hopefully, what we were talking about, if we get the city buy-in and the state buy-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7612)|
| 2:06:59| then with this renovation, the monies that we have left over may in fact operate this center for 18 months initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7619)|
| 2:07:08| on what we already have budgeted that the mayor and Chris have budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| Plus, if we could get the we've got the buy-in from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| The problem right now is the buy-in from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| How much do you have budgeted for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| We have a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Chris has budgeted a million dollars from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| What can we do to facilitate a little necessary urgency on the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7648)|
| 2:07:38| Well, we went to federal court last week, and the judge issued a little urgency to form a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7658)|
| 2:07:47| to talk about the buy-in from all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| So I'm not sure that that task force has been formed yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| but I think that's probably the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| But with this new acquiring the building next to where the CSU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| that alleviates the issues that Amy and I talked about in her community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| with the people that didn't want it built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| And it also eliminates Helen Ross McNabb from having to move the CSU to accommodate where the safety center was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7692)|
| 2:08:20| So this is a very key component that we have, which makes it even better than it was before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7700)|
| 2:08:28| which is as far as we have come in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| So I think it's all coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| But I would be glad to do whatever to facilitate the urgency, as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7714)|
| 2:08:43| Kind of like a robust matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| Hang on there, J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| It looks like we're rolling with this addition to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| I saw Mayor O'Hara in the hall briefly before the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| and she was pretty adamant that she felt it was a county issue and not a city issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| Her thoughts may have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| I have not talked with her about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| But since the property has been purchased and since we're looking, as you said, at a reduced cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| is there any way we could get some updated numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| Andy Black was here earlier, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| I didn't know we were going to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| Or I'd have Andy stick around and give you a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Maybe if you want me to have Andy come next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| That would be great if we could, because, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| He can tell you more about the building and what he thinks the remodeling costs would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| But he assured me that it would be, with the extra monies left over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| that we could probably operate that facility for, you know, anywhere from 12 to 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| with the monies that Knox County we already have appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| That's what I was saying, is that, you know, we could, you know, wait on the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| or we could say, no, we want to do this, we're going to do this, and move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| I'm all for the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| Let's say we're going to do it and let's move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| And particularly with this new development, I think it's something we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| So, yes, if we could go ahead, Mr. Chairman, put this on the discussion items for next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| and start looking at some new figures, I think that would be appropriate to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| Because ultimately if they flatly refuse to buy in, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| there's really not anything we can do to facilitate their buy-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| So it's, as you said, Commissioner Hammond, we need to either go or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7817)|
| 2:10:25| Don't say that too quickly there, J.J., about what there may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| I've been beating my head against the wall for three and a half years over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| We've got a new law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| I'm not stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| The new law director has new tricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| J.J., somewhat, or the sheriff, somewhat answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| Their reluctance is it because even though a majority of the people that were to be incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| come from the city limits, is it that city taxpayers pay county taxes also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| And there are a lot of numbers, I can assure you, that come from city zip codes that are housed in our hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| Yeah, the majority probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| But as you touched on it or alluded to it, ultimately the bag is held by us, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| If the federal judge says you're overcrowded, you do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| It's not the city that has to respond, is it you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| We're the one that pays the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| And I just, it does appear we're low on the priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| I saw that the city's spending $15 million on that public service garage, which I'm sure they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| I'm not criticizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| But I thought we certainly would have a million in there, but I think we're very low on the priority list there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| Ultimately it's a million now or $20 million later for a pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| I mean, that's what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| We've got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| I don't have anything for the Sheriff, but I'd just like to comment on Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| I tend to agree with the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| I mean, it's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| I mean, that's kind of where we take care of prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| You know, it's like saying, hey, it would be great for the city to come out and pave our roads out in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| or even better, the county come in and, you know, pave a road in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| But that's just, that's not our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| I mean, this is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| And I'm in favor of us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| I mean, I think this is, the Sheriff's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| This is a dollars and cents thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| To me, it makes no sense for us to build a $20 million pod when we can fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| But we're going to sit here and, no, city, please, please come, or you better come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7949)|
| 2:12:34| or you guys are the guilty parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| No, you're probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| There probably are more county residents that happen to live in the city that are incarcerated out there in Maloneyville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| and downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| I mean, that's probably a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| But they're county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| We take the county takes care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| I think we need to belly up to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| Let's figure out what this takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| State, county partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| I don't know if Ross McNabb gives something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Whoever has skin in the game, let's move forward with this and not delay it and delay it, waiting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| You know, the city has pension problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| They've got development problems, just like we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| We deal with our stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| They deal with theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| And let's just move on, in my humble opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| Ms. Rose, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| Sam pretty much said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| I think it would be great if the city would kick in some money for capital expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| I think that would be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| And I've said, the sheriff is not hearing anything new out of my mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| I've said this before, and I've said it to Mayor O'Hara, that I back her on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| She will not recognize any savings out of her budget out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| We're going to recognize tremendous savings out of our budget for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| And we should own this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| This is Knox County's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| We should own it and move forward and make it happen without waiting for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| I just don't think that's appropriate, and I don't think it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| So, Andy Black, you want Andy here next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Thanks, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| We've got to back up just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| An agenda item we glitched on, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Coordinates 13-5-104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Mr. Law Director had a question about that, that the peddlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| No, not the peddlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| It's the beer board made a recommendation for a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8061)|
| 2:14:28| which we need to suspend the rules and add the resolution about the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| and putting off the enforcement of the law of the form until October 1, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| is what the beer board recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| And we failed to add that to the agenda earlier in the meeting so we could vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8082)|
| 2:14:47| We just passed a resolution which codified that requirement of the form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| and to parallel that we'll need a resolution to defer enforcement until October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8092)|
| 2:15:00| So we'll have to suspend the rules, add it to the agenda, vote or discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| or whatever you want to do on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| I'm just saying that's what the beer board did to help us be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| I'm throwing that out to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| Can I hear a motion to suspend the rules and add this back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| Any discussion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| So can I hear a motion to add the language of making a grace period until October 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8128)|
| 2:15:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| Any discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Is that adequate, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| Well, as long as everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| Everybody understands what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| We're holding off enforcement or requiring these businesses to adhere to this document requirement until October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8146)|
| 2:15:57| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| It will be done by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| By resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| Amy, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| We have another discussion item regarding the Railroad Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| Mr. McKenzie, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| I think there was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| It's ironic in a way that this past week, well, this past week I've been out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| But sometime during the week I got a question related to railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| And I was going to have a discussion item about railroads anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| We have only in the county one committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| One authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| It's a rail authority, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| And what does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| We handle the short line railroads in terms of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| We only have one operator as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| So it's a pretty streamlined organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| My question really deals with the real estate that Norfolk Southern has that traverses Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8220)|
| 2:17:09| How do we, Knox County, approach them about their real estate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8229)|
| 2:17:17| Because I have a problem with Maloneville, the crossing at Emory Road, and Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8237)|
| 2:17:28| They're eyesores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| All those three are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| If it was anyone else in Knox County, I'd wrestle up a codes guy, and they'd go either the property owner would bring the grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8251)|
| 2:17:47| and railroad rubbish under control, or they'd do it, the county would do it, and then take a lien on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8267)|
| 2:17:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| Now, I'm speaking out of turn because that is outside of our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| But it's TDOT, I think, is the first line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| I mean, it skips city, county, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| I think TDOT is the first line of defense in terms of trying to effect a change in their policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8289)|
| 2:18:17| and that will probably be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| I would assume they're on some kind of cleanup and grass cutting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| I don't know if they're just off, don't have a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| Well, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| Now, this had something to do because we were, this was about five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| and I could probably hunt it down in an e-mail and forward it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| but I had the law director then do some research on who controls the railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| This had to do with crossings and making them quiet zones and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| And I believe it's all federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| I just thought that they had some kind of, this sounds like a maintenance issue as opposed to making it above grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8326)|
| 2:18:54| or quieter or whatnot, so I thought they had a TDOT contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| It still may be all federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| This may be something the law director has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| Yeah, it's probably best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| We'll look into it for you and come back with a recommendation as to who you need to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| And how's the best way to approach it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| I mean, if it is a dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| Well, no, these are all appearance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| There is a litter of railroad cross ties at both Corrington, which is just County Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8357)|
| 2:19:26| and Maloneville, which is also County Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| And the roadbed's been renovated a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| And then the second one is a state highway crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| but it's the adjacent property that I'm sure I'm almost positive that within the railroad right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8378)|
| 2:19:51| there are grave sites, cemetery remains of Little Flat Creek Baptist Church, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8391)|
| 2:20:04| The church being taken as railroad right-of-way and moving up the road and the cemetery remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| unless some interred were moved, and I don't know the aspects of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| But if the railroad's going to claim like 45 foot of right-of-way from the center of the rail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| they've got tombstones standing in the right-of-way you can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| And it's just a all three of them are issues of if it were any other property owner in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8427)|
| 2:20:37| we would be out with codes people saying clean this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| We'll check in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| And Mr. Armstrong will get back to us on that, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| Can I comment on the railroad issue briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| Because I set up the rail authority here in Knox County about 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| It's a nickel of every gallon of diesel fuel that is bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| The railroad pays a buck and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| You know, if it's a gulf gas station, it's $4 because there's no tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| But they pay a nickel a gallon in this huge fund that goes to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| And Knoxville gets six percent of it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| And it's solely for 22 miles of the Knoxville and Holston River Railroad, right, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Which runs from Coster down below Tyson, crosses Kingston Park at Gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| comes down here diagonally below Nyland State and goes to Forks River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| That's what Sam has a vote over, spending that nickel of a gallon that we get one-sixth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| or one-twentieth of what it generates statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| And Commissioner Briggs is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| The railroads spend tens of millions of dollars a year lobbying in Nashville and Washington, even more importantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8510)|
| 2:21:56| And they're preempted from everything we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| But nevertheless, they are very sensitive to public input and comment because of their great propensity to get into lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8520)|
| 2:22:09| and need to acquire land, even though they have the eminent domain power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| as we see up there in Jefferson County sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| But I can probably try to get some north or southern people to respond to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8538)|
| 2:22:26| particularly about the graveyard and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| They're probably only more likely to cut a right-of-way if it is they perceive there could be a lawsuit, an accident there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8548)|
| 2:22:36| and then they're sued for not cutting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| Oh, we hit the train because the school bus hit the train because you didn't cut the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| That's sort of how they respond, instead of an aesthetic, make-it-look-nice situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| But, you know, they're, again, they just opened a big facility out here at Coster here about a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| and some brass were in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| But they are somewhat receptive to, you know, I've been out of the business five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| but I still know they are somewhat receptive to public opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| and I would be happy to try to find a local contact and just get it to you, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| to try to clean up the crossings, if that would help any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| I didn't mean to belabor that, but, you know, they're sort of a different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| Thank you, Mr. Shouse, and thank you for checking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8603)|

| 2:24:40| First item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| Request of David C. Campbell for rezoning from A, agricultural, to P.R., planned residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8682)|
| 2:24:49| located south side Shackleford Lane, east of Graves Road, Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| Commissioner McKenzie is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| MPC, do you have a report, anything you'd like to say on this bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| I think we discussed it last time, but maybe a quick summary is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| This request for planned residential zoning at three dwelling units per acre filed at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8726)|
| 2:25:33| This property is located on the south side of Shackleford Lane, east of Graves Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| It contains approximately 51.72 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8739)|
| 2:25:43| The property lays fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| It's in an area that is on the sector plan proposed for low-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8746)|
| 2:25:54| It's in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| Staff took all of that in account when it made its recommendation to support the application at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| at three dwelling units per acre for planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8763)|
| 2:26:07| We did note in the staff report, and I think it's been something that's been brought up in discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| and testimony at MPC last month or two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| that potentially some improvements may be needed to Shackleford Lane and Graves Road to make everything work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8778)|
| 2:26:27| and that would be determined at the planned development stage in consultation with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8787)|
| 2:26:35| Again, MPC recommended planned residential at two dwelling units per acre, and that is before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8795)|
| 2:26:45| Obviously less than the staff recommendation, and so that is a recommendation before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| And, Buzz, the MPC vote, I got the other MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| What was the MPC vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| What was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| What we had was eight to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| Eight to seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| Sir, if you give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| My name is Paul Schmierbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| I live at 8677 Shackleford Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| I represent a number of homeowners in this area, and we recommend that the zoning remain at agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8832)|
| 2:27:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Anybody else care to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| The 8th District, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8848)|
| 2:27:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| We've had a report from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Let me back up for just a second to a couple of months ago when this was presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8865)|
| 2:27:54| The two units per acre on approximately 50 acres would be 100 residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8874)|
| 2:28:04| and at that time there was intense opposition to that density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8884)|
| 2:28:13| and the local residents' neighbors were calling for leaving the, as stated here just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8893)|
| 2:28:26| leave the zoning as agricultural, which would be one acre residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8906)|
| 2:28:36| Since there was disagreement over what the plan ought to be, we, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8916)|
| 2:28:43| wandered away from the table to have some meetings to determine if there could be a plan offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8923)|
| 2:28:51| that would be acceptable to the adjacent residences and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| Now, there's some action that's been taken, such as approaching is sewer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8937)|
| 2:29:08| Remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| And that's the only thing that I know of that may have come out of the conversations in the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| In other words, I view us to still be at the same point that we were then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| Recommendation from MPC saying planned residential, two to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8962)|
| 2:29:28| and the adjacent property owner saying leave it agricultural, one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8968)|
| 2:29:37| That's what I'm hearing from the local residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| Now, today I've had a conversation with, or maybe it was yesterday, I don't remember which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8981)|
| 2:29:48| a developer saying that there has been a different plan that's been proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| but I've not seen that plan presented to the local landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=8994)|
| 2:30:04| I was kind of hoping Daniel Sanders might be here because I think he did attend one meeting of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9004)|
| 2:30:12| and the developer to see what his take on this may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| But absence of the presentation of a plan by the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9016)|
| 2:30:23| which is acceptable to the local area residents, I'd have to move for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130624ed?start=9023)|
