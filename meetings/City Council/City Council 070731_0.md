| 0:03:27| I don't want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I'll wait until they come up on the agenda, but 9A, which is the solicitations ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| and 10A, which is the appeal, one will be postponed, one will be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| but I want to talk more about both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| That's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| You're going to postpone one and withdraw one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=223)|

| 0:04:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Three or four things to announce to everyone tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| A couple of different press events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| I'm going to let Chris Woodhope, because he's been involved with one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| announce one of them for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Next week, Wednesday, April 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=270)|
| 0:04:41| August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| August 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| August 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Can I start over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| We're going to have a groundbreaking for the new Knoxville Skate Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| and it's at Tyson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| It's August 8th at 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| And I just want to welcome everybody to bring their skateboards and grab a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| shovel and begin the process of building everybody's skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| I do want to acknowledge a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| I want to thank Barbara Pelow, Councilman Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| for helping out in our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| We spent about 12 different meetings talking about figuring out the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| and what the park is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| I'd also like to thank Joe Walsh of the city and Doug Battelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| who was my co-chair in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Doug just did a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| He's a great, great co-chair and good man to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| I really appreciated his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Brian Bousheen, Nate Holder, Jake Cabler are all people on the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| who have generated a lot of enthusiasm among skateboarders for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| and it's really, really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| So thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Also, we have a ribbon-cutting opening for the Emporium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| the space, remember, that came out of all the discussion after the Candy Factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| I think you're really going to be pleased with what is there in terms of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| that's available for arts and various groups Thursday, August 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| I think that would be at 1030 there at the Emporium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| I encourage everyone to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Finally, Regal announced today that they are going to be opening the week of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| August 27th, the new Cinema Downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| So we're very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| There will be several charitable events throughout the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| and then the kind of regular schedule opening will be on that Friday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| which is the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| But there will be various events through the week with dollar movies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| benefiting various charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| So more about that later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| but we're obviously very excited about that after a long period of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| One other just quick note I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Last week, just every now and then, the city that you work so hard for does a lot of great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| There's a lot of great things that sometimes we don't acknowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| And some of those were here long before we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| One of those last week is I went to the end-of-the-year party for a summer camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| that our Parks and Rec puts on for about 800 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Is that right, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| We've been doing it for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| Eight hundred kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| It cost them $20 for the entire summer to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| Great program, full of field trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| The good thing is we run out of the rec center, so we piggyback on all the expenses we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| We already have buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| We already have people there at most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| So the additional cost to us is not a great cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| But for 800 families, probably some of them are siblings, so 500 or 600 families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| it's a great answer for the summertime and how to have your kids busy in good places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| And, like I said, it's really at minimal cost to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| And it's kind of one of those things that I didn't have anything to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| so I could come and brag on people who do have a lot to do with a really good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| I'm going to go to Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Well, I just wanted to announce that on this Saturday, I think, Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| you're going to have your running shoes on because I understand that you're going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| to help us with the opening whistle and then you're going to run in the annual West Hills Gazebo Run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| This is a benefit each year that we work with the track club in order to be able to raise some funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| which are spent expressly to add amenities to the West Hills Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| which is such a great amenity for our neighborhoods there as well as for the west part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| And we just appreciate your support and your being willing to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| and Sam and Joe for their assistance in making this a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| So if you have not registered, I'm sure they will be happy to reach you on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| and give you your little T-shirt and let you run or walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| And there's a kid's walk and run and it's just a fun thing for the whole family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| So how far is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| It's too far for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| And it's in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| So, you know, it's not for the faint of heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| But, Councilwoman Woodhull, I understand that your talents are many when it comes to being fleet of foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| and your stamina is great because I think you enjoyed the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| It's a 5K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| It's not a marathon now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| He ran the whole one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| And I think that needed to be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| That was quite an endurance test for you and we congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| We would welcome you on Saturday morning, be there about 7, 7.30 and sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| At 8 o'clock we'll shoot that gun and send you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Would you give us a quick update on Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Yes, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| This afternoon, because he had some surgery on his Achilles tendon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| which had been causing him to limp around town for too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| I think a doctor jumped all over him and made him know that he had exactly until today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| to have that surgery or his window for surgery and repair was going to go closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| So, unfortunately, he had to have the surgery this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| I went down and spent some time with Marcio while he had his surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| He just did great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| They sent him home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| I think all prayers need to go out to Marcio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| She's going to be dealing with him for about two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| His foot needs to be in the air above the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| That's how we keep the pain and swelling down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| So, if you need him, he'll be glad to speak to you in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| but he will have his foot over his head and he may sound like a new Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| She's going to put him on a diet while he's in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| If you're watching this, Mark and Marcio, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Also this weekend is the nationally famous Lonsdale Homecoming, one of Knoxville's great neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| The homecoming is Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| The parade is Saturday morning at 10, opening ceremonies at 11 and activities all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| Folks are welcome to come for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| It's actually a lot of fun, one of the great homecomings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| I wanted to make another announcement following up on Councilman Woodall's announcement about the Tyson Park Skate Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| to talk a little bit about the Fountain City Skate Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| There's going to be a public meeting about that a week from tonight, 6.30, up at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| And I wanted to give council people a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| There's some disagreement about the location of the new Fountain City Skate Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| And this is something that eventually would come to council when there's a contract to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| And in an effort to try and make the public discussion better, we're going to be bringing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| I'm going to be bringing a resolution about the location of the skate park tentatively set for August 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| So I wanted to give people a heads up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| There is some debate about that and wanting people to know that that's something coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Right now we're looking at the location across the street from the old Target property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| They're at the corner of Knox Road and Maple Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Most folks have followed in the press lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| There was the unfortunate situation with someone, rural metro, getting to them a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| You know, I looked into it, and it's actually a resident of the city in the 4th District down in Fountain City off of Garden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| I'm sure, you know, most folks know where Garden Drive was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| And I talked to Chief Key today, and I also talked to folks at rural metro who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| and would, you know, like the opportunity to discuss the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| And first I just wanted to, you know, ask Chief Key, you know, what the city did when the call came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=753)|
| 0:12:42| When we received the call, we arrived on the scene in two minutes and 17 seconds, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| We started treating the patient and waited on the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| It was an unfortunate event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| I think the KFD personnel were very professional in an extremely difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| As you said, it's very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| My department has talked with rural metro and the 911 center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| and I'm confident that they will take the proper steps to keep this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| I mean, a part of the controversy here that what happened was there are similarly named streets in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| I mean, there's a Hiawassee in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| There's a Hiawassee in Oakwood-Lincoln Park, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| There's, you know, a Hiawassee in Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| There are some bluffs around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| But it's, you know, my understanding, because I've talked to the head of our EMS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| that the city system actually flashes on the screen if they're similarly named streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| Is that correct, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| A caution comes up if there are more than one streets with the same name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| We have two Cedars, Cedar Lane, Cedar Avenue, two or three Bellevues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| A couple of Cherries, I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| The staff that represented from Rural Metro wanted to come on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| and explain their situation, what they're doing to try to remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Sir, if you'd come forward and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| My name is Tim Souter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I'm the operations manager for our Rural Metro ambulance operation here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Our offices are at 910 Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| I agree with Chief Keefe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| There are numerous streets in the city and the county with similar sounding names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| There are a lot of streets with the same names that have a spelling difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| that makes it very difficult for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| We are not at all pleased with the response we had to this resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| I have personally met with her and spoke with the resident and tried to reassure her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| We have been on that street many times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| We have a normally we've been there, I want to say, 11 times on that street this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| with an average response time of less than seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| This was the outlier on those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| I understand you told me today, and you're very kind to discuss it with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| the person who took the call has been doing this for years and is a very proficient person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| But when I was going over materials, you know, it was like there were 18 units on call that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| and I believe 16 were occupied with other calls at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Was it not possible to move one over to try to cut that down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| I mean, I understand hindsight is 20-20, and it's a learning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| but was it possible to make that, cut that time down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| Our ambulance, the ambulance that was initially dispatched was sent from our level two post in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| which is the Broadwind 640 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Again, they normally would have less than a seven-minute response to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| The ambulance was at post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Based on this human error that occurred, they were sent to the Huasi at our, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| Watauga Avenue as opposed to Watauga Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| That ambulance made that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| We were unable to locate the exact address on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Our dispatchers were in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Our comm center manager was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Our fire chief, the rural metro fire chief, was also in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| We were watching the ambulance on our AVL system, our tracking system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| We were watching the ambulance try to locate this address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| and we were as frustrated as the paramedic and EMT on that ambulance because they could not get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| So much, in fact, that our communications manager went to the parking lot and got in his vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| and drove to Watauga Avenue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| When they did that, one of our other supervisors, one of our field supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| mentioned the fact that could this possibly be Watauga Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| When we did that, we had already started a second ambulance to the Watauga Avenue address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| thinking that our crew had just flat gotten lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| When the realization was made that it was Watauga Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| our ambulance was turned around and we made it there in six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I guess, you know, my concern is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| recently it's come that rural metro has gotten fined for not having adequate response times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| and I've heard that fines could have been levied in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| And, you know, I mean, a little more than two years ago, my son had a choking incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| and rural metro took a little over ten minutes to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| and the first responder out of fire station number three at Baxter Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| was there in probably less than three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| So, you know, like I said, it's an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| You know, I know you all are trying to correct it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| but it sounds like more hiring does need to occur to get people on trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| You know, my concern is that, you know, in the future, if we're not able to correct this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| the city can do this business, do this service itself, or contract out on itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| I just think this is something that, while unfortunate, we've got to be careful with in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| and that we need to monitor it for the safety of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Okay. Any other comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| 6A is an application for renewal of a retailer's certificate for Andrea Dykes Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| liquor 2913 Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1116)|
| 0:18:44| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| As a note concerning possibly referring this, there's an issue to the law director concerning a criminal history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1130)|
| 0:19:00| The criminal history involves, that people are probably wondering about, involves DUIs and a public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| The question that's pertinent is whether or not there's ever been a conviction of the alcoholic beverage statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| Those are statutes, to my understanding, that pertain to the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| and are separate and apart from the misdemeanor criminal sections involving DUIs and public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1162)|
| 0:19:32| So based upon the information provided by the police department, it appears to me that the applicant honestly answered the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| So you could be sitting in jail for a DUI and still get a permit, a renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| As I said, a DUI or a public intoxication does not fall within the alcoholic beverage statutes, as I understand them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| those being having to do with the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Do you care to come forward, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Care to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Well, actually, I have pending charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| If you could give us your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Andrea Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| I expect to have them resolved in the next month or two favorably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| and I just request that I get the certificate so I can meet my deadline for my renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| and an assurance that there will be no future questionable incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Mr. Kaiser, if these type of violations are a concern to this council regarding future permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| this would be something to talk with our state delegation about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Well, so I understand our personal sense of wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| notwithstanding that we don't have any standing to not permit this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| Is it being advised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Again, the DUIs, there are several DUIs that are, frankly, pretty old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| and a current charge of public intoxication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| I don't know what the status of the disposition on that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| I don't know if there's a conviction yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| It's not indicated I want the police department to provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Well, the very recent nature of that is an enormous concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Because while the others are quite old, we have two situations in December of 06,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1297)|
| 0:21:47| which is just barely six months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| and then within two weeks we have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Two weeks of this date we have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| So I feel maybe Mr. Swanson appears to want to say something also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| If that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| If I could, let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| This is, again, city council acting in its administrative quasi-judicial capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| And the legislature, the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| sets out for you the parameters under which you must act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| and does not allow you the personal leeway to make a decision as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| or not you feel comfortable with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| What the law requires is for you to determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| or not this applicant meets the law as it currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| If you are uncomfortable with that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| the method to address that is to speak with your state legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| and have the law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| But just because you're uncomfortable with the law does not give you latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| to fail to follow the law as you indicated in your oath of office that you would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| It also exposes this council to liability should you choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you for citing it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| So the liquor lobby is emasculated city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| Is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I didn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| I don't think we understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| What we're saying is the liquor lobby emasculated city council concerning the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| Well, we've elected state legislators who determine what the law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| and whether or not they adhere to the wishes of lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| or whether or not they adhere to the wishes of constituencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| for you to determine as electors of those representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Okay, the motion on the floor in the second was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| 8A is a resolution to amend Resolution Number R-235-07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| so as to clarify the term of Mark Rosser on the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| and to elect Mark Rosser to the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| for the Downtown Cinema, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| 8A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 16, Article 11, Section 16-420, Section B-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| regulating charitable solicitation on public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Requested by Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Yeah, just this is the doing the thing in intersections to collect money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| This was originally moving because the Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| or the Firefighters Association wanted to do a boot day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| and we were trying to get this passed with new locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| They've been unable to secure a solicitations permit now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| so they can't actually do a boot day, so that's been put off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| So I was going to postpone this so we could think about it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| It seemed there was more interest in this than I had at first expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| and wanted to float the idea of a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| There seemed to be some questions about whether we should be allowing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| where we should be allowing it, how we should be allowing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| and I just wanted to, before I postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| to see if there was discussion about a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| That's not a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Wasn't yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| That's a fish for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Yes, that was a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| I've just looked in particular at the locations located in the district I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| and I don't personally feel a need for a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| but I just have concerns about Broadway and Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| That's a pretty busy intersection with at least five and six lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| and I was going to, tonight, if this went to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| I was going to suggest substituting Washington Pike and Whittle Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| which is actually right by the Whittle Springs fire station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| and then see if there was some possible alternative for Broadway and Cedar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| because that's pretty big too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Like Councilman Frost, there's a number of intersections on this list that I have concerns about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| and as I began to think about this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| I guess I got back to the very basic question of why have we done this since 1962 at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1568)|
| 0:26:17| I think with the increase of congestion in our intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| and people's busy lives and cell phones, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| I think that there's a great deal of liability in permitting folks to step out into intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| and put not only their lives at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| but the lives of the drivers that are coming through that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| I would like to have some kind of discussion about this among my fellow council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| first to discuss whether or not we need this at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| and then if we do, how do we pick intersections that are satisfactory to everybody going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| whether or not that's in a time during a meeting or in a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Either one is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I'm happy to attend a workshop, but I do think it deserves some discussion and some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Well, I agree with Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| I think that this whole thing needs to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| I look at intersections in my district and I think, you know, does this really make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| And we need to vet it in a way that people can weigh in, people from the community too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| But I want to make a more pedestrian-friendly city out of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| but I don't know that that correlates with solicitation happening in traffic lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1651)|
| 0:27:39| I think that's an entirely different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| So I really do feel like we need to have some sort of discussion on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| and give the community, people in the community, an opportunity to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| I think I spoke to this last council meeting because of my concern about a couple of, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| I think the first time it was brought up, I spoke to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| and a couple of those intersections were eliminated, which was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| But the shocking thing to me two weeks ago was that one was interjected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| which had not been considered previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| So the manner in which we've gone about this is just really something I have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| And in speaking with Officer Boone today, who I believe was involved with this on KPD's part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1701)|
| 0:28:30| you know, he reminded me that he had emailed us all initially to indicate that any time that automobiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| and people are put into the same intersection, it's a concern to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| So I think just given our sense of the danger, I think Vice Mayor Brown spoke to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| and we pulled some intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| The 62 ordinance, obviously, is not something we can continue to operate under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| because many of the intersections that are listed there don't even exist today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| because of changes in configuration of streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| So this is not something we can just let lie because now it is being permitted in a manner in which it's just unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| because it isn't accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| So, you know, I'll do whatever, a workshop or a public, you know, discussion at council meeting, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| But, frankly, a workshop gives the opportunity to have maybe some people there who have some better information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| and some better recommendations than we might come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| I think we need some people who are accustomed to looking at traffic and traffic patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| and knowing exactly specifically what the traffic patterns and the turn patterns are in some of these intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| So I think maybe I would encourage that we have an opportunity to sit down and talk with people who can come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1783)|
| 0:29:52| and spend some time with us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| So a workshop sounds to be the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Is there any history of any accidents occurring when these things are, when these solicitations are going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| Because I think a lot of these are, they've been doing this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| And so if we do have a workshop, that's something I would like to know with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| if there have been accidents at these locations during these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| If I can just quickly respond to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| The reason I was just doing a little dance about item number L there is because that is an intersection where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| in my five years on council, I've probably had more concerns and comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| and complaints about, you know, problems there, accidents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| I think Margie Nichols had a terrible accident at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| And that came up earlier when we were discussing a rezoning that was in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| So, you know, yes, I do see some issues here that haven't been given consideration, enough consideration in my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| And I think to approve this list as it's presented tonight would certainly raise a lot of eyebrows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| and bring some complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| I just think we need to look at it more carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| It sounds to me like we want a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| And I'd like to have some of the questions answered that Councilman Roddy was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1879)|
| 0:31:28| I'd like to know what other cities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| So I think we could probably get a whole lot done in an hour, and it doesn't have to be something long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I guess tradition here is we don't actually make motions for workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| We poll folks on that, and I guess if Ms. Mitchell can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| I'll make a motion to postpone this for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| The motion is to postpone for six weeks and second by Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| All those in favor of postponing six weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1915)|

| 0:32:12| Is that an old light, Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1934)|

| 0:33:07| On behalf of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Association, of the Board of Zoning Appeals approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1987)|

| 0:33:17| a residence on a small lot of record in an R2 General Residential District, property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| located at 1707 Harvey Street, in conjunction with Resolution 11K, which is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| approving the appeal by Ed Eckenrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Councilman, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Whatever the name is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I didn't know if you wanted to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I'll make, I guess, a motion to withdraw in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| I want to explain what happened on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| This is a situation, if you all have your little map here, there's a vacant lot you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| see on this map across the street from the one that's under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| Three houses have been built on that lot, on actually those three lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| The problem here is that when the sign went up about the first BZA appeal, it was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| corner across the street from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| It was on, and there is a little section there that it is completely believable that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| could try and put a house in, and the Neighborhood Association went ballistic over this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| they thought the house was going in on that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| I had some conversations once I saw this material with neighborhood people, and I kept telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| them it's a standard lot, and frankly, they thought I was crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Sat down with the applicant for lunch today, a bunch of us in the neighborhood, had a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| About 20 minutes in, after a little butting heads, somebody said, why did they move the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| sign for the appeal across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| And the applicant said, well, that's the right location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| And it was until 20 minutes into a hard discussion that we actually realized that the lot that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| was being appealed was a different one from where the sign that got everybody's dander| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| So this has been one that, and I promised Buzz I'd be nice to him about the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| put the sign up, but this is where a simple mistake by MPC caused a delay in the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| of a house, a lot of consternation in the neighborhood, quite a bit of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| So it's an unfortunate incident I wanted to explain, and cost the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| $150 for an appeal, and I'm sure it cost the applicant something as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| So I'll go ahead and make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Could we respectfully ask the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider refunding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association their fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2131)|

| 0:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2134)|

| 0:36:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| 11B is a resolution to honor the memory of the late Judge T. Edward Cole, and to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| its sincere condolences to the members of his family upon the occasion of his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Requested by Councilmembers Frost, Pelo, Roddy, and Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| I just wanted to recognize the sons of Judge Cole are here in case they'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| It's just one that I think we have to really consider strongly to be very important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| this whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Dr. Lyons, you referenced the project on North Central a moment ago, and you and I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| discussion this afternoon about capacity for TIF projects, and that was one of my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| is, you know, is there a point at which the scale tips where we feel like we've incentivized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| all we can in a particular redevelopment area, and we want to take that capacity elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| particularly the Broadway Central area, which I think is kind of a next area of focus that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| And you and I kind of had to explain to the Council what your response was to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| My response to that was that we really don't see this as a finite capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| It's not infinite, but it's very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| That is, the amount of TIF financing that's available is a direct function of the amount of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| The more that's invested, the more taxes that will be generated, and that goes into the entire equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| and that's not fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| So if we're thinking of tremendous investment potential in these areas, it's really not limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| It's not finite, and there's really no boundary around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Now, that being said, we have told people who call, we've had some folks who've made an inquiry earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| We said, we think we can very enthusiastically recommend this, and they didn't come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| and two years later they've called up and said, well, we're not quite so sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| partially because the risk-reward structure of that has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| That is, as more of the market is picked up, we're not so sure that it is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| or as much of a TIF is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| One thing I might refer everybody to in the table is that you might notice at the column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| the percent of total capital investment that's a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| That's going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Part of it is, it's not all yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| It's how much of this project does the tax finance part of it have to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| and we're going really an average that was 16, 17 early down through 12 and now under 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| and we're basically telling folks that the earlier somebody comes, the more risk they're taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| the more advantage to the city by being the first in and taking that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| The city should be playing a more active role in that, but as time goes by, I don't think there's infinite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| there's limited capacity, but on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| our intention is basically to make them more and more difficult to get as we get toward the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| and not have the expectation be after everybody else has gone in, taken the risk at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| gone out on a limb for this loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and then folks to come in at the very end when almost all the buildings are built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| We're not saying it won't be possible if there's a very difficult structure, but it's going to be a higher bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| and I think we've been appreciated having Mr. Martin as part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| and bringing the expertise from the banking world and the finance world to our discussion to help us make those sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| of judgments about how much risk is at the front end and how much at the back end as we fill in these redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| I guess the answer is I don't see it as finite and limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| but I think the city's position has to be that as we go through time, they're more difficult and fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| So you're not concerned about the lost tax revenue, you're just more concerned about that but-for question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| And, well, I still think we have to be sure it's all risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| Our risk is that we go, you know, we think you'll build it anyway, and then they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| Then the building deteriorates, it's a fire hazard, we get no tax revenue in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Let's say eight years later somebody comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| We would have been better off getting that money for the first eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| So there's risk on both sides of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| and we have to make that judgment call knowing that we might risk creating a problem situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| by having a building deteriorate and become dilapidated and possibly catch on fire, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| But if we really come to the conclusion internally that this is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| see, we don't feel we're losing any tax revenue because of the but-for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| We think we're gaining some because we're getting something that would have not otherwise occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| That's really the big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| And we think out of taxpayer, present taxpayer dollars, no dollars have been invested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| No checks have been written from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| It's deferred, of course, the whole idea of this is deferred what would not have otherwise happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| So that being said, we've got to approach each of these carefully with plenty of diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| and we've got to make the case not only that it would not have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| but why it's in the taxpayer interest to have this project happen rather than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| And sometimes the good argument is, well, maybe we'll just let the market take its course on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| because this particular project doesn't really fulfill that great of public interest by getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| You know, that's part of it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| And I haven't run the numbers in our packet, but per this column on your chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| what is the percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| The TIF is what percent of total capital investment in this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Madeline, did we have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| I think it's --I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| I thought it was 10 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| We're in the 10 area, but I don't have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| It's 400,000, and the total is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| The total is 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| That would be 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| 12 or 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| It's about 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| It's a 400,000 out of a $4 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Yeah, I guess just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| I know, Dr. Lyons, I've had a lot of conversations with you about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| and I know there is sort of a --it's not a science of this will be built so we won't fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| It's more of an art, you know, in how you make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| And I guess I'll go on record, going on a limb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| saying that I'd rather see us err on the side of giving a TIF, making the mistake, if it's 50-50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| of giving something because we do get a benefit out of that rather than the scenario you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| of choosing that something doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| because I think that risk of a project not happening, a building sitting vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| deteriorating is a net loss to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| So there's a, I guess, erring on the side of doing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And I hate saying erring on the side of giving tax breaks to developers, but I think that does make good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Well, let me just say--.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Councilman Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| I just wanted to say that I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| And in the case of this particular project, the old city is just a fragile community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2560)|
| 0:42:48| And since I've been in Knoxville, I've seen it sort of go up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| And I've spent a lot of time working with some of the vendors and shop owners down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| And they, I think they appreciate this kind of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| So I just wanted to say I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| Let me make one last comment just on this whole discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| And several of you all have had conversations, Meryl and some others today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| These are great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| This is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| This is complex, actually, to understand how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Number two, to understand the but for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I mean, like you said, it's an art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| It's not a science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Number three, to know when's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I mean, if we're stoking the fire window, we said the fire can take off on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| And, again, that's a judgment question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| We recognize the difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| As Bill said, we turn down way more of these than we say yes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| And we are ahead on the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| But these are hard things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| And so this is a great and healthy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| And I want to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| The chair would like to recognize former Mayor Kyle Testerman, who is here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| He's been missing city council meetings and wants to attend on a regular basis going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| But, Mayor Testerman, if you would stand up, we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| If you'd come to the podium real quick, I know you swore to never have to talk at a city council meeting again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2656)|

| 0:44:28| And I hope it's another 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| Let me just say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| That would be a good way to go out right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| I would just like to applaud and thank city council and the mayor's office for the rebirth of our center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2679)|
| 0:44:50| This started back when I was in office back in 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| Matter of fact, this property or some of the property that you've talked about tonight, my wife and Rod Townsend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| and others bought in 1971 to keep it from being bulldozed and destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| They were all very strong preservationists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| And we have taken the buildings down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| I've been in it about 15 years because when Rod developed terminal cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| he kind of made my wife promise that if we would take over the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| then we would develop it and restore it to its former integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| and that is some of the finest historic buildings in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| And I think for those of you who have not been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| I'd love an opportunity to show you the buildings that have been restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| They're all 100% occupied, excluding the one you were discussing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| With residential, I have eight residential and all the rest of it is office professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| And I've had tenants that have been there with me for nearly ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| But I've dreamed of the downtown being at the point that it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| And I think as a result of the TIFs and as a result of your all's participation and understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2772)|
| 0:46:20| and in some instances not understanding, TIFs are difficult types of things to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| But as a result of that, it has infused not only money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| but it's infused new life and blood to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| And I think that you deserve all the credit in the world for that forward thinking and that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| And I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2803)|

| 0:49:48| Councilmember Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Mayor, I brought this up a month ago and really wanted to have a resolution ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| Two weeks ago we didn't get that done, but I did bring it, insist on doing it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| because I want to continue to raise awareness and, you know, to alert people to keep their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| eyes open about thieves going into middle and low income houses and even some commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| buildings and stealing basically copper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| And so I want to just continue to raise the awareness level and also I plan to write our state and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| federal officials to look at ways and solutions to try to prevent this from happening and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3027)|
| 0:50:36| making it so easy for thieves to go sell raw materials like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| And so I beg your forgiveness for speaking on it for three council meetings, but I've heard more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3040)|
| 0:50:49| and more about it and it continues to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And it seems to me it's in the lower income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I know I also spoke to it prior to this meeting and a previous meeting too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| but I think it bears repeating that this is a situation where some thefts are proportionate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3063)|
| 0:51:11| the loss is proportionate to what the thief gains more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| You know, somebody steals your money and, you know, you lose $100, they gain $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| This is so disproportionate, not that that should matter necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| but they steal and get a few hundred dollars for copper that they gut out of a house, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3088)|
| 0:51:36| and leave the water spilling out into the basement or into the house or they gut an HVAC system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| air conditioning, heating and air conditioning system, do thousands and thousands of dollars worth of damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| So it's a critical issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| The cause of that is for no other reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| I want to recognize Sam Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| And I know it's not only affected residents but churches, and he was mentioning to me rec centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3117)|
| 0:52:05| I would just say that it is a critical situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| I know at one of our recreation centers, in the name of stealing $200 worth of copper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| it cost the department around 15, between $15,000 and $20,000 to replace the heating and air conditioning unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| So it is hitting us everywhere is the point, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3146)|

| 0:54:30| Shoot, let them knock each other out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| I mean, if they ain't going to have the taxpayers' money like that, every one of them need to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3272)|

| 0:54:51| That's how the white guys do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| They don't tell the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| That's how they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3293)|

| 0:55:01| Government run that bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Military, man, it's all political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| And we ain't never, and it's the biggest organization in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| It ain't never run that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| I mean, Mr. Mayor, if you did something like that, your dad didn't come up here and run you up out of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| But no offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| But I tell you what, those boys, man, I mean, I was up there, Mr. Mayor, for three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| I had never seen nothing that bad in government in all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| I mean, that was bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| That was really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I mean, man, boy, nepotism is going to get all of them killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| So that's the joke of the day, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| Give me a couple minutes because I've got something for you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| You know, I sit here and listen to you all say, city council, how you all going to rebuild downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| You know, I sit back and think of all the representatives that have been in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| And the latest is Vice Mayor Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| He's been on council for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Only time I've seen that guy do something, he finally did something where they were going to close down the Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| Hey, how you doing, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| They were going to shut down Burlington Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| He finally, he wasn't going to do nothing until the residents finally made him do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| Only time I've seen him when the county and the city gave Walker and them some money to restructure those buildings down on Vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| And we don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| You all give them money to help them redo these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Then the county and them come along and rent these buildings and then pay them with taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| I guess I'm just dumb because that don't make good government to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| To give these guys, Mr. P. Lowe, money and help them get these buildings running, pretty much it's taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3398)|
| 0:56:48| And then they finally get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Then the county and them come in and the city and them come in and y'all rent the space that y'all just gave money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| It don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Maybe I'm crazy, but it don't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| When that brother's been in office for six years and I'm hearing all y'all talking about tips and all this stuff and all this money and contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| and Mr. Murray, I come up here every two weeks and I can't even get sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| You know, you sit here and just approve, finalize your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| And we can't even get sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| And I come up here for the last month or so asking to get sidewalks on Harrison and Louise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| Yeah, it's a bad area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| It's an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| But they need sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| And they deserve sidewalks because most people that drive up and down through there, they're taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| They ain't gang bangers hanging over by by-laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Those decent everyday people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| But then I hear all y'all hollering at me and y'all all in agreement with everything you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| But, you know, everything is just about y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| The ones that don't have lights, y'all, I could say another word, but we're on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| You know, it tees me off because y'all act like we don't exist, Mr. Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| Y'all act like we don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| When are you going to take care of the people, Mr. Murray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| I run over there by Hazen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| I sit there and watch Bob Wilson and them get brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| They put brand new doggone pipes in down there over by the Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| So they could, I asked the guys in the yellow truck, I said, why are y'all doing this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Oh, Bob Wilson and them want them because they want to ride their bikes through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| Well, heck, all we want to do is walk it up and down the same old sidewalk, Mr. Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| But you guys can take guys that are making over a hundred and something thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| and build them some nice paved areas where it was hilly, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| They paved it out, fixed it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Man, I mean, it looked good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I ain't going to, you know, I'm not going to say I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Then I watched them guys put Mr. Wilson and them some sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| I said, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| I talked to one man on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| He said, man, they put, I never want the city to put another sidewalk in for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| It took six weeks, about six months to get a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Well, I seen them guys put a sidewalk in there for Mr. Wilson and them less than a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| And it's looking darn good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| So they can ride their bikes on their lunch break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Thirty more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Give me a couple more minutes, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3546)|

| 0:59:10| Y'all can give me a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Y'all talk about Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Y'all talk about all these things that mean something to white folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Well, it's not for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| It's something to this black man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| And I can't get nothing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| So why shouldn't we come up here and ask petition, y'all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| I know people have been calling 311, Mr. Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| They ain't got no help yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| And I walk around there, but they still hollering, when he going to come down Surry Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| We still waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| You know, I think y'all full of stuff, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Y'all sound good to those that y'all want to sound good to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| But those of us that really want something done that means something to us, we can't never get nothing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| I don't understand it, Mr. Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| And I know you're a better man than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070731?start=3591)|
