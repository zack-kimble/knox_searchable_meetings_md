| 0:02:28| Those pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| For the Mayor's Report, I want to start off by just mentioning to Chief Sharp how grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| we are that all of our firefighters are okay after the scary incident yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=155)|
| 0:02:43| And as you all might know, there was a roof collapse during a fire on Riverside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| and two firefighters were trapped inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| And I know they were rescued quickly, but I'm sure it was pretty tense during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| If you'd like to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Any time we have an incident like that, it sets a high alert to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| As a matter of fact, we had a May Day called, which is just nothing more than either a firefighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| is trapped or has fallen through a roof or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Fortunately, it only lasted a few seconds, and they were able to get out of there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| with just minor injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| So the outcome is good, but it certainly puts everybody on high alert for a short period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| So, and it is a reminder to us just how dangerous and unpredictable your work, and of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| the work of our police officers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| And we are so happy that everybody got out safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Would you please let them know that we are thinking about them and are so grateful for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| their work and so happy about how this turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| So I want to remind everybody that next Tuesday, August 25th, we will have a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| at 5.30 p.m. in the Lions Club building in Fountain City Park to talk about plans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| Fountain City Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| As you all will remember, we included $250,000 in last year's budget for infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| to the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| We did the first part of that last year of repairing a leak in the berm around the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| but there's still a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| So our engineering department and the consultants will present their plans and the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| and we'll also talk about opportunities for community involvement as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| So again, that meeting about the Fountain City Lake is next Tuesday, August 25th at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| 5.30 p.m. at the Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| So here's an announcement for any community group or individuals who have ideas for improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| to their local parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| The Park and Recreation Department is accepting applications for the annual challenge grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| which are matching grants for the development of public parks or recreation facilities in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| If an application is approved, Parks and Recreation will reimburse 50% of the cost of a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| up to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| So you have to raise, you know, whatever amount you want us to give up to $2,500, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| to match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| So we are accepting applications from now until September 18th, and the grant recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| will be notified October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| And all of the application forms and information about this is on the website at knoxviltn.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| slash citygrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| So we encourage groups out there who want to spruce up their neighborhood park to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| So also tonight, I want to welcome, you see this group of young people and our high schoolers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| actually from I think every high school in our city and county and some, every private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| public school and private schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=345)|

| 0:05:53| Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| And I had an opportunity to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Would you all just stand for a minute here so we can see you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=359)|

| 0:06:19| bit about this leadership group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=379)|

| 0:06:25| and you can tell it's a really sharp group here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you so much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=388)|

| 0:06:36| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=396)|

| 0:07:39| What happened 8,240 days ago today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| Bob Wessel started at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Is that because you were here, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| Dang, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| On January 25th, where's Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Bob, come stand up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=476)|

| 0:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| So on January 25th, 1993, which was 8,240, I don't know who counted that, but days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| today, Bob came to work at the city of Knoxville, and after tonight, he has only eight working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| days left until his retirement, and we're counting each final this, final that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| During that time, at a conservative estimate, Bob has attended more than 500 city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| meetings, and you've worked for four mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=509)|

| 0:08:35| And so tonight is his last city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| I see that tear in your eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| You all know what a great job Bob has done for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| First, as director of public service, which was his first job, and then since 2008, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| director of redevelopment, and also, starting in 2008 as director of redevelopment, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| of this stuff happening downtown, all this revitalization happening downtown, has really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| been a key part of Bob being there, working with Bill Lyons, working with that team, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| really, we see so much change for the better in our city because of Bob's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| And he's been an invaluable colleague and a resource for all of us, and I got to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| with him as director of community development, and our two departments tried to work very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| closely together, and then now as mayor, I want to thank you, Bob, for the absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=566)|

| 0:17:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| I had asked for this resolution for MPC to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| We all know that there's a lot of controversy going on right now about cell towers and cell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| towers in different parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| So I had a conversation with Mr. Green, and I'd like to have him just make a comment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| what we're looking into on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| So identify yourself first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| I'm Gerald Green, Executive Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| We'll be looking at those things that the city has the authority to regulate, issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| such as buffering, setbacks from adjoining property owners, cell tower heights, and possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| looking at locations where cell towers are most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| As I'm sure most of the Council is aware, the federal government has preempted a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| of the local jurisdiction's authority to regulate cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| As part of this, we will also be looking at updating the Cellular Communications Facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| Plan, which was completed in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| That plan is woefully outdated now, given the increased usage of cell phones, the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| for data as well as communication, and we'll use that as a guide in updating the cell tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| And I fear that some of the information we may gather as we go through this may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| what we want to hear, and that is that there is, as we are aware, an increasing demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| for cell phone usage, which results in an increasing demand for cell towers, and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| to locate those in the community and serve the commercial areas and the residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| will be a challenge we'll all have to face, and we'll do our best to address within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| parameters we're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Mayor, what I was looking for is just what Gerald was talking about in terms of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| There's a lot of rumors going around about cell towers and what can and cannot be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| and I think this is a pretty appropriate time to really take a look at this and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| So that was the reason behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| I think we spoke about this briefly at the last meeting, the need to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| The future looks somewhat grim to me if we're going to have, in the worst case, Mr. Perry's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| projection that we might have a cell tower every square mile and maybe even two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| of them that bespeaks of sort of a nightmare city of porcupines sticking up in the landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| and there's some hope, of course, that the technology will be approved, but I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| we have to, looking forward as stewards, decide what we're going to do about this issue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| the growing problem that we'll be facing in terms of visual blight and interference in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| I think we may need a second resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I've already spoken to Mr. Frost briefly, but we may end up, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| asking our federal congressional delegation from Tennessee to make some amendments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| the FCC Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| If MPC is going to claim that its hands are tied once the applicant makes some showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| of signal weakness in how their proposal is going to work, and that's what their consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| seems to tell them, at least at their workshop, then I think we need to reach higher for relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| But I, too, spoke to Mr. Green, and he was hopeful that some of the loose language we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| have, like something should be done, can be changed to mandatory language, and we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| looking forward to his help to tighten up our own standards to see what other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| But I think the problem is bigger than that, and we may have to ask our congressional delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| if they would find a way to mitigate what looks like a growing problem, and maybe we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Maybe we all turn on these devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| But at that workshop, they did say that there were seven companies that could come in at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| this point, or that do come in at this point, and claim they need to beef up their turf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| so that one or two carriers might have great coverage there, but someone else may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| And right now, apparently, they have a right to ask for another tower or another location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| for the companies that don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| But there are a total of 13 companies that compete in this business, and we were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| at least by MPC's expert, that any one of them could come in, even the ones outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| the seven, and ask for their own tower or their own tower location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| We do ask for things like co-location, where several companies get on one tower, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| a lot of people competing for small spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| So it's important we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| We want our future to be not only effective electronically, but attractive aesthetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Yeah, I just, you know, I'll support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| I didn't sign on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| I'm not exactly sure what we're going to get out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| I mean, if we had updates and mandates, wouldn't we have already put those in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| I mean, they're not, if you want to do it, they're mandatory, and when it comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| from the FCC or whomever would, the rulemaking would be on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| And one of the things that, again, I'm Gerald Green, excuse me, Green with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| One of the things we'll be looking at is the difference in language between our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| plan and the recent federal legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Another thing will be the references to the facilities plan, which Councilman, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| it was Della Volpe, alluded to, where the ordinance states that we refer to the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| plan, but the facilities plan is not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| So there's some misunderstanding, I think, among the general public that we have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| power than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| I think we need to clean up those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| We also need to look to assure that the ordinance we have is in line with recent federal legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| and do what we can to promote co-location, identify if there is a maximum height we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| for towers in residential areas, and that height may be exceeded in non-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| The buffering standards that we have in our current ordinance are pretty lax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| I feel that we should, could look at those, and if it's the will of the Commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| the Council, increase those buffering requirements, particularly in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| So there are some things we can do to clarify and assure that our ordinance is in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| with recent legislation, and also to assure that we're in line with the technology that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| is changing, and to do what we can to protect residential areas while providing service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| Alright, well, it sounds like, to me, a couple of your statements that still I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| that we're operating under the mandatory FCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| Whatever comes down, you seem like you're saying that there's loopholes in there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| I guess that will come out all in due time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| I mean, a little bit of my point is, I asked the MPC in December, the 9th, actually, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| look at these payday loan alternative cash businesses, and today I got my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| And it's not a reflection on you, it's the workload that the MPC has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| So I want to make sure, you know, when we throw these assignments to MPC, that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| really something in behind it, that there's a reason for it, rather than a knee-jerk reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| to all of a sudden it's a hot-button issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| So, you know, we just need to be cognizant of the MPC's time, and if there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| we can do, then so be it, but, you know, I just don't want knee-jerk reactions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Again, Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I appreciate that, and one of the things that I have on my agenda to talk to Council about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| in there is that as these requests for assistance and studies come from the Council to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| that you place priorities on those, because we do have limited staff, as you stated, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| limited time to work on them, so one thing I would like the Council to start thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| about, and I'll work with you on this, is what the various tasks that you're assigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| to us to assign priorities to those that we know which is most important and can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| those in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| I did not sign on to support this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| I would be happy for us to get some clarification on what kind of wiggle room there is, if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| is any, or if there isn't, we need to be real clear about that also, but I too am concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| that we not fall into a pattern that we may have seen at other times of asking MPC to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| do more than there is the MPC staff to be effective in executing, so I am concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| about our prioritizing, and that's a great idea that you've advanced, for us to be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| clear about where this falls in our priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Gerald, as you go about this, I hope that you will study, I hope you have time to study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| and that is a concern of mine as well, what other communities do, especially in the northeastern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| I go to that part of the country with some frequency, and I don't see cell towers, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| yet I have all the service, so I know it's not magic, they're doing something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| and in Europe, it's hilly up there, and in Europe, I don't see cell towers, so service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| is getting there somehow, so obviously they have discovered some alternatives or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| And finally, the technology changes so rapidly that at some point, I suspect we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| to have to remove a bunch of these towers, there will be something else that will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| this service, so I hope we find some provision that allows for that removal or ensures that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| The motion passes and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knoxville Leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Foundation to provide Empowerment Zone Program income funding for facade restoration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| accessibility improvement to the Regas building at 318 North Gay Street in an amount not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| exceed $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I want to ask a question about the Empowerment Zone funding, do we still have funds for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Empowerment Zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Good evening, Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| This is program income that we get from the Empowerment Zone funds that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| We don't have any more grant funds, but this is loan repayments that are coming back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| to the city and so we are allowed to reuse that for economic development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Yeah, thank you Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Becky, I did want to talk a little bit about that because this is a little bit of an unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| how you're using program funds and then also you all have considered what the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| development is going to be on this and try to explain that a little bit more and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| the number of jobs that KLF tends to bring to that site and really the economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| that you see it's going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| So this project came to us as an application for the Commercial Facade Improvement Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| The Knoxville Leadership Foundation is a non-profit and non-profits are not eligible for our Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| Facade Improvement Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| That program supports entities that are profitable, create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| So we valued this project because, number one, it's restoring the Regas Building, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| is a very important building to Knoxville's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| It's in an area that is improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| We see the economic value of restoring that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Also they are housing the Alliance for Better Non-Profits in that building, which will house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| right now seven non-profits, about 60 employees will be there daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| So we value the economic development potential on that block just by having that many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| They're also installing a training room and conference center inside the building where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| other people can come for training, other non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| So additional folks will be there on site up to maybe 100 to 150 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| There'll be a cafe in the building as well, and we just felt like it was a good use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| our funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| We're structuring the $50,000 as a five-year forgivable loan, just like the Facade Improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| Program, and we will have a lien on the property for those five years to make sure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| property's maintained, that taxes are paid, and the building is kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Chris Martin's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Chris, would you come up and tell us when you expect to be in and what your plans are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Chris Martin with the Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| This project is something we've been working on for, oh gosh, two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Had the opportunity to, the KLF did, to purchase the Regas building, and you all are familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| It's probably an anniversary dinner or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I've toured thousands of people through it already, and everybody's got at least one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| Regas story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| There's probably some skeletons that you all know about living in the basement that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| won't talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| But no, we are repurposing this building, basically taking the facade back to the 1920s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| It was originally built as a five-story building, the Harris Building, in 1890.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| So these funds will help us with the Magnolia Avenue side, as well as the Gay Street side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| And then, you know, accessibility has always been an issue in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| Restrooms, there's no elevator in the building to get to the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| So we're putting in an elevator, all the facilities will be, restroom facilities will be accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| So this is going to help us, this grant will help us with some of those things to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| that back, take an old building back and make it a modern facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| But the greater purpose of this project is, while the restoration of the building is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| valuable in and of itself, we really believe that through KLF, there's six other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| that are housed there through a co-location of offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| As Becky said, there will be about 60 staff that are representing those organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| plus all the, we're already upstairs in the top floor now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| It's been finished and we've moved in, and it's already a lot of activity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| But the Alliance for Better Nonprofits is a non-profit that we've started that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| be a training facility for non-profits in the community, promoting collaboration between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| other non-profits, helping them get better at what they're doing, trying to help neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| groups and non-profits serving many of our neighborhoods get stronger and better at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| So we see a lot of people in and out of this building every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| It's going to be used for the purpose of trying to help our community get stronger and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| So there's a lot of value added to this project, other than just the façade and the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| But this grant will help us with the outside on the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| We're really taking it serious to try to make this a place that everybody in this room today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| as well as the community, can be proud of, and then take us back a little bit in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| to reclaim some of what that building used to be back in the 20s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Thanks a lot, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Just out of curiosity, Chris, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| You say you're going to have the rooms available for non-profits and community groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Will it be a charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Yeah, it'll be a small charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| The goal of the building is to be a self-supporting kind of project, so we all don't have to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| money to pay the light bill and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| So there will be a cost to a small fee charge for the facility usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| We're working out the structure on that now and what that's going to be, but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| going to be overwhelming for groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I'm a non-profit in a non-profit world for a long time, and we're not looking to go rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| the Crowne Plaza every time we want to have a training meeting or something, but it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| be available for use for everybody, any non-profit that wants to use it, as well as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| We're going to probably have enough space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| There's about 4,500 square feet in the training space, the conference room, a really nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| boardroom there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| So we feel like we'll be able to entertain a lot of different meetings going on at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Okay, Council, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to accept letters of support to the Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Development Board of the City of Knoxville for qualifying pilot agreements involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| low-income housing tax credits determined to be in the best interest of the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| This particular resolution is part of a package of four, and I don't know whether it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| to speak now or not, but there's been a lot of work put into this to try to get the Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| Hotel separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| No, no, this is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| It has nothing to do with the Farragut Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| It's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| We're on C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| We're on C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| It's a separate resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| D, E, and F are the Farragut Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| There are three, not four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| That's all on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| So, really what this is, is that this is what the state law has changed, and you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| to notify us, but you're saying in this resolution that you will notify us for low-income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| You're going to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| So, Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Becky, do you want to address this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Good evening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| You may recall we brought several of these to council earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| This is specific to affordable housing that apply for low-income housing tax credits to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| either renovate their properties or build new, and they request pilots in order to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| their rents at an affordable rate because currently they are taxed on the value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| tax credit equity on their property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| They can't raise their rents because they have to keep them at an affordable rate, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| it renders these projects just infeasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| So, state law was changed to allow the mayor to send a letter to the Industrial Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| Board asking for pilots just for the projects that receive low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| We are asking for your all's permission to allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| to apply for and accept a Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program loan from the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| of Housing and Urban Development in the amount of $2.9 million to be reloaned to Dover Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| Corporation for the redevelopment of the Farragut Hotel Building, which will create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| 83 full-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| So, Council, I see one light on so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| We have two people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| Would you like to go ahead and hear them first, or do you want to say something first, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| Let me make a preliminary remark, and I think then we'll hear the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| I know a lot of work has gone into this project of trying to get the Farragut Hotel...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| First of all, would you please pull the mic close to you so that our interpreters can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| hear properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Can you hear it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Yeah, a lot of work has gone into trying to get this project to be in a position to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I guess, feasible for the restoration of the Farragut Hotel, and I certainly appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| the effort that's gone into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I know that the Dover operation has done a great job with the Oak Hill School, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| Oakwood School up in Mark's district, in terms of rehabbing that, shows that they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| quality workmanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| But there is an element, and I hope Bob will use his next eight days wisely in trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| resolve this, about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Now, the first item is the loan, and I can see how we might get past that, but this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2341)|
| 0:39:13| claims that it must have, to be feasible, 160 spaces of parking in our State Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| It is a facility that this community has invested $13 million in so far to build and to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| to, and it is used heavily by people who both live in downtown and who visit downtown to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| shop, to have dinner, to go to the theater, and it strikes me as somehow improper that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2376)|
| 0:39:44| we just take 160 spaces out of that building and devote it to a private company's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2384)|
| 0:39:55| This would be more appropriate, in my mind, if we somehow partnered with them to add a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| floor to the garage and they got their 160 spaces there, but I am told that this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| is full at times, that people who leave the building during the day and come back in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| evening can't even get into the place, even though they have a space there, because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| the demand that happens when something interesting is happening downtown or people want to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| It is built for the taxpayers, and I feel troubled that we're going to give one hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| an advantage that the other six or seven hotels downtown don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| They've built their own garages, they maintain them, I guess the Oliver probably is the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| one that doesn't have its own garage, but all the other ones, the Holiday Inn, the Marriott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| the Courtyard, the Hilton, the Hampton Inn, all have built garages, and these businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| are at about 65% occupancy, according to Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| We're going to not only bring in a competitor, but give them a competitive advantage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| seems to me to be unfair and to misuse the dollars that we invested in the garage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| the people to use and not for out-of-towners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| There's a rate, and Bob has provided justifications for it, but it is the lowest possible rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| that is paid in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| You know, if people can come to a posh hotel, the Farragut, as restored, they can pay $7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| a night to stay in the garage and put their car in the garage, and I'm troubled by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| If that is crucial to this overall project, then I'm going to have a problem with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| even though I like the project and I'm willing to support the pilot and the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| That's my preliminary remark, and I hope that that will be addressed, but I've heard all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| kinds of rationales, but I haven't heard anything that makes it fair to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Well, we're on D right now, which is about the Section 108 loan guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| So we'll ask Bob to address that when we get to F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| So let me...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I don't have a problem with the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| So, Becky Hancock, do you want to go ahead and speak to the project, since you're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2516)|

| 0:45:34| and there are certain nights where parking is scarce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| I know that the parking garage has been recently added onto in the last, I don't know, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| or three years ago, and then I believe there's an additional 50 spaces that are being added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| now on the lower end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| We don't promise parking to our patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| We do tout that there are several free parking garages around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Obviously, the State Street is the closest, but there's also the Market Street Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| or, excuse me, Walnut, the one by Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Locust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Yes, Locust, and Locust as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| I'm certainly not a parking expert, but I do not anticipate that being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| I also understand that the garage is designed, if needed, to eventually have additional levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| to be built, but I'm not an engineer or a parking expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you for your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Rick, did you want to speak now, or if they had questions, did you want to speak to the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I'm Rick Dover, Dover Development Corporation, 4921 Humberg Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| We bought the Farragut Hotel property nine months ago and started looking around for what it ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2812)|
| 0:47:00| and ultimately felt like a signature hotel for Knoxville was the right choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2820)|
| 0:47:10| As a result, we explored a number of different options there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| and one of the things that always came back to us was parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| The other thing was that the Knoxville hotel market is not robust to the point that it would support what it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2840)|
| 0:47:31| to build a first-class upscale hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| We felt like if we were going to do the Farragut, that's what it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| So as we dug into it deeper, we were able to determine what the best programming for the property ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2860)|
| 0:47:50| given the current market situation, and one of the things that always came up was parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| There really are not any branded hotels in Knox County that don't have their own parking facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| When we looked at the Farragut as a stand-alone property, it was not a cheap building to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| It will not be a cheap building to rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| It doesn't need to be done on the cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| It ought to be done in a first-class manner, which is not to be over the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| but a properly done competitive product that would attract both business travelers and tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2900)|
| 0:48:29| which is a growing segment of what we have downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| It's really a destination unto itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| We need a signature hotel property in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| So we looked at what does it take to do it right and what are the problems, what are the challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| and ultimately what we came back with were the things that are before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| We were able to develop and secure a construction financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| It's at a certain level that leaves us a gap between what it will cost to do the project and what we can borrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| and in addition to that, what we can reasonably put in as an equity investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| I would point out that we have over $3.9 million of cash invested in the property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| There is no debt on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Are there other alternative uses for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Yes, we certainly hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| I bought the building because I believed in the location, I believed in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| and I believe in downtown Knoxville, having lived here most of my 61 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| and I think that in order for it to work, we're going to have to have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| In order for it to work, we've got to have a sustainable level of debt that can be serviceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| given the level of hotel rents in downtown Knoxville, and I don't want to be misquoted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| We want to grow the overall pie for hospitality downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| We are not looking to steal, if you will, from other facilities in order to support ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| so I think that if we can create something that's a little bit out of the box in terms of not what's there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| but something that's authentically Knoxville, 100% Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| but is also connected with a major international brand that gives us the lifeline of reservations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| because other than that, we don't have any opportunity to finance or sustain this type of an operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| These are the things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Starting out, we're going to create a large number of job opportunities downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| We're going to create a lot of revenue on occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| We're going to create revenue in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| And then obviously we're going to pay for the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| so the idea of free parking is not what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| We would have liked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| That was not something that was available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| so we're paying the same rate that downtown residents pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| and it's a long-term parking agreement that ultimately, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| would provide the revenue needed to add additional parking deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| should this council decide that was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Thirty-three more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| No, I think I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| You're finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Well, I'm sure there will be more questions of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Thank you, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| While he's there, if I could, I've got a question while he's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| On the subject of it not being free parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| will there be escalators in there after so much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| whatever your monthly rent is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| The current plan that is going to come up here right behind this one, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| is the parking provision, which is a 30-year lease on the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| The current rate, which is half of the commercial rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| which is the residential rate for downtown residents, is in place for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| After that, it floats up to whatever the current equivalent of that formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| would provide through the balance of the primary term of the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| and the subsequent renewal terms that are attended thereto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| which would be two additional renewal terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| In other words, I want to be really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| If we don't have parking, we don't have a hotel on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| and that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| We don't make any money on the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| We would hope to do valet parking for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| that would allow them to pull up on Clinch or Gay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| and get out of their cars with their bags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| and have their car taken care of for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| and then in the morning they would come down and have breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| We would have a breakfast bar for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| and then they could during the week go to their business meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| or whatever was available on the weekends socially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| which we hope to activate the ballroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| and be more of a social and tourism venue on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| But if we don't have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| then we can't service the primary contributors to a hotel's sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| which is the business traveler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| So we've got to have parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| and basically it's a break-even proposition for us at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| Council, if you don't mind, I'd like to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Can we handle D and E and then actually have the next bit of dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| on the parking when we get to F, if you all don't mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| So right now we're on D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| which has to do with the Section 108 loan guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Are there any questions, any discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| I guess I just wanted to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| this is obviously something you have to take a tough look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| given the length of the size of incentives and the length of incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| but I'm supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| I think it's an extraordinary proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| You've got huge sales tax implications with travelers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| additional travelers staying in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| You've got, you know, a destination hotel, historic hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| which our downtown doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| I mean, I certainly believe it's our downtown's our best tourist attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| I think this would certainly add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| You know, as to the parking issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| I think anything we do in that building is going to add pressure to the parking situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| So a hotel I think maybe will have less than other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| And I think this council took steps in what we did in the garage to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| and we're in a position, if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| and from my understanding we don't at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| we can put additional floors on that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Okay, so on the loan guarantee, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| I know it's kind of hard to not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I apologize, but it's sort of all wrapped up in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| I just didn't want any more questions about the parking yet, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| You had to say it the way you did, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Okay, so this is on the Section 108 loan guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Okay, so E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| A resolution, 11E is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| to negotiate and accept from Dover Development Corporation payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| with respect to property located at 530 South Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in the furtherance of the public purposes of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| as defined by Tenancy Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Okay, this is about the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| And only about the pilot, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| So help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Just trying to follow our rules of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| It strikes me that most of what Rick Dover said about the cost of tackling an old building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| and, you know, restoring it and making it first class and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| is addressed by this pilot which gives them, in essence, a property tax break for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3376)|
| 0:56:25| It's a very long period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| And that money that's in excess of what the old property tax is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| will go to help finance the loans that they are incurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| I think he said they put $3.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| They're borrowing up to $18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I think it's $16 million they're borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| And they're getting that other loan that we just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| But this pilot is designed to encourage someone to tackle a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| that doesn't have a great, what, cost-benefit ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| when you look at fixing something that's old and needs a lot of rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| and a lot of rework and electrical and utilities and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| So I think this answers his main question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Now the question we're going to address later is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| is the parking a fair part of that package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| or is there something wrong done to the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| And I'll leave that for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| But I'm supporting the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| It's always fun to follow Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| I had talked to Bob this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Please pull it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| And, Bob, on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| it was not filled in in terms of what the estimated taxes were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| once this project's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Would you address that so that people understand what is being paid today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| and in 25 years what will happen to that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Current city property taxes are $38,997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| County property tax is $33,193.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| CBID taxes, their assessment is $4,578.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| That's where the first set of numbers came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| so there was some confusion there as we went through all the various steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| That will hold for 25 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| We should say that you all are not acting on the CBID tax tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| though their property development committee met last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| and they are going to support a 25-year pilot even on the CBID portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| which is something they've not done before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| so that was passed unanimously by their committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| It has not yet gone to their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| and it will probably come back to you all in another month, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| City property tax would be, under the proposed $19 million future valuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| would be $207,000, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| and the county would be $176,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| If the property is appraised more than that in 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| the taxes will continue to go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| These are estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| The IDB, state law says you have to appraise these every three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| like you do every other piece of property and stake that listing on the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| So, yeah, it will go up with the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| And also, while you're up here, and, again, congratulations on your retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| and where you're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| I know that's not part of what we're talking about, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| However, would you just briefly tell all of us, I know you sent us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| what we have done downtown in terms of TIFs and pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| and what that has done not only for the development of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| but also the finances involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Well, the sheet I sent, I guess, is yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| that outlined all the comprehensive view of all the pilots that we have downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| The ones that are coming off the list as of 2015, there's about six or seven of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| had a pre-project appraisal of about $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| That's currently up to a real-life appraisal now right at $36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| So that's more than Bill's the mathematician in the crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| I think, tells how large that increase is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| And that's comparable to all the other properties we have going on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| The big sheet is it's easily $100 million to improve the appraised value downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| from a vacant downtown to a very active downtown in a matter of a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| And remember, always on the TIFs and pilots, we haven't had to write a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| The developers write the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Repeat that. Repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| We have not had to write a check for that for TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| The developers are writing the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| They're doing the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| and we're using the infrastructure we already have in place to make sure this is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| I don't think I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| What was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| We're using that infrastructure that we currently have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Developers write the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| This doesn't mean we have to write a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| We don't write a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| It's been a great semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| I joked earlier that we call plays out of the Dr. Bill Lyons playbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| Dr. Lyons, when he came 12 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| really began an aggressive TIF and pilot program and educated people how that should work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| and it's paid wonderful dividends throughout our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| And now I think it's interesting to look at the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Outside of this one, you're seeing them in the Magnolia Warehouse District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| and the Jackson Depot District, so moving out to the Corps is already starting to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| so it's all very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| So now we're voting on the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| The ayes have it, and the pilot is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| 11F is a resolution authorizing the Public Building Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| to negotiate a lease agreement with Dover Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| for 160 parking spaces in the State Street parking garage for a period of 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| with an initial rate to be $32.50 per space for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| for use by the proposed Farragut Hotel to be located at 530 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| So, Bob, why don't you come up since several questions have been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| and speak to the rationale for what we are requesting on the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3703)|
| 1:01:56| I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Let me try to get my notes organized here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| I guess back to the beginning when we first started talking with Rick Dover about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| and he came and he said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| there are several things that are going to have to happen from the city side to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| and we've already dealt with two of those tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| We're going to need the 108 loan guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| We're going to need a pilot for a considerable period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| and we're going to need free parking in the State Street garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| And I said, well, there's no way that's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| that we just can't go forward that way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| So we began a series of very serious negotiations on where to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| and where we settled, and this comes from the bias that we want to have this hotel happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| is that if they would pay the residential rate, which is half the commercial rate, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| a parking incentive that was established about a decade ago to get residents into downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| and do that for a 10-year period of time, that would be the initial lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| and then it would move up during the period of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| However, the commercial rate moved, it would move up right along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| but only at half of that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| So that's what's in front of you tonight that's there for a 30-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| with two potentially future 30-year extensions as long as there's a hotel in place at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| Once again, we're asking tonight to allow PVA to do this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| That's within their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| They manage our garages for us, and they can negotiate this for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| They just need written approval from the city to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| and that's what we're asking for here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| A couple of things to mention that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| First, as we've said before, there will be no hotel without the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| I think we could all agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| When we did the justification for adding the floor onto the State Street Garage five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| and began the process of doing that, the number one justification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| and I can go back and pull memos from the file to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| was that we had the Farragut Hotel as a large building on the east side of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| that was going to need to be developed, and for it to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| That was never told to this council when that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| We absolutely talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Yes, sir, I would disagree with you respectfully with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| So we talked about that at that time, and we moved forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| After we got through with that and while we were in the middle of that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| we moved forward on Lakeshore Park and the bottom two floors of the State Street Garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| used by City for storage, some by KPD, some by service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| And so what we did, and it was a great idea Rick Emmett had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| and David Bryce, I think the two of them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| was let's move the storage out of downtown, get it out to Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| and let's create more parking within that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| So we created 60 new spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| So in the last three years, we've created 300 new spaces in that parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| And there's a lot of use in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Especially on heavy special events nights, you get to the full house down in that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| One thing we've done to address that, of course, is we built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| we supported building the other garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| I think we call that the Locust Street Garage at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| which is free nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| The Langley Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| The Langley Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| It's free nights and weekends, which will really help with the downtown event growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| which is when you're really getting the parking overflow problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| is when you're getting the big downtown events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| So there's another 1,000 spaces that have been added in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| to help with events parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| The Farragut will not need these spaces for 18 more months at a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| and we feel like that during those 18 months that we can devise a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| to make sure that the needs of the hotel are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| the needs of the residents that are using it are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| and the needs of the various businesses and special events around there are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| It's going to be a process to do all that, but we feel like it's doable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| and we have the resources to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| We just need to work at it, continue to work at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| See if I have anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| As far as other hotels, I like this little line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| When this hotel was built, it was built in a world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| where people traveled by trolleys and trains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| They did not travel by automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| You wouldn't build a hotel like this today, and that's part of the charm of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| And so that's one reason we think that they need the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| and we've invested in that to make sure that it will work for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| So it's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| It's not an apples-to-apples comparison there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| It's an apples-to-oranges comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| With that, I think I'll be quiet and take questions if we have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Vice Mayor Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| Wow, this is a complicated one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| I think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I have a little bit of angst with the amount of time for the pilot, but it is what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| and if that's the only way it will work, then that's what we've got to do, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| President de la Volpe was talking about folks will be down there, local people shop, visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| and the table will be used and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Well, that's on the reverse of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| With this hotel, then you'll have people coming from out of town that will do exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| They may be doing it on Monday night and Tuesday night and Wednesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| when the slower times of the week when restaurants don't seem to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| and any type of entertainment venue, generally those are the slower nights, maybe even Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| So this is going to put more people downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| Mr. Dover seems to think that he's going to capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| or have some support from the business traveler, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| I don't know what the flag's going to be, so I can't really speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| but I think it's going to be a different type of individual that would stay at the Hampton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| or some of the other more business-friendly, like when I travel where I stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| I think that I would hope that they would attract a different clientele,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| somebody that's there more on a leisurely basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| And then the multiplier takes effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| You know, this is money that people spend here that come from out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| and there's a certain multiplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| I used to be in the business, and I can't remember what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| but it's like two and a half, three times that it turns over whatever they leave behind in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| and that's the best kind of money that we can have because it doesn't tax our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| our infrastructure and what have you, and then they leave that money and it multiplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| It's going to create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| So that's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| And as far as the existing hotels that did have to invest their dollars back when these hotels were built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4094)|
| 1:08:23| it was a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| It was a way different time, and that's the way it was done back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| But when I travel around the country, it is not unusual at all to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| when they drive off in your car and it's going to a public facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| I mean, there's just so much room in urban America now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| So you're having to take advantage of that, and we keep going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| and that's what we've done with some of our parking facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| and we've got the ability to go up even higher if that need comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| And I hope that it does come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| But the hotels, yes, they made that investment back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| but they benefit every day by the amount of money that we've invested since that time in the early 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| when the original Hyatt Regency it was, now it's the Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| The Hilton, I think, was built for the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| And, you know, these properties have truly benefited by the amount of taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| that has been invested in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| They certainly are the beneficiary, and I think that they would say that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| And, Bob, I mean, you allude to the warehouse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Well, you know, I'm partners in, you know, a couple of warehouses that my family bought years and years and years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| and we didn't get a penny from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| We didn't ask for a penny from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| But I'm elated that I know that the property values of those properties are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| The demand is going to be there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| So, I mean, it just works that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| You know, it's just like getting, you know, paying $5 for a pizza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| and the next day there's a coupon for half off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| I mean, it's just buyer beware, and I think that we have made a good investment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| So I'm happy to hear that it's going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| So, you know, I would like to hear if, you know, if there's another solution to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4209)|
| 1:10:19| I hear there's concern for parking, but I would be curious to hear of an alternative to these hundreds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| I mean, if you can't park, they're not going to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| What are they going to do, just leave their cars running in the middle of the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| I mean, we've got to have someplace to put these cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| I understand concern, but I'd also like to hear alternatives to what could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| So I think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| I'm going to support it, and I appreciate Mr. Dover and his company's investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| or possible investment, future investment in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Yes, Bob, I wanted to personally thank you for all the you've already got a round of applause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| but I personally want to thank you for all the work you've done for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| It's been an honor and pleasure to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| I have a question that may be a little premature about it's been mentioned that we may have to add another floor to the State Street garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4267)|
| 1:11:17| and I'm thinking in terms of how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| When we did that before, if I remember, there was some funds, I think, through the hall income tax unexpectedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4281)|
| 1:11:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Do we have to do that in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| And if either Dr. Lyons or Christy can answer that, it may be kind of hard because that's just an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| Let me just say, if you do it, you get 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| If you go another floor like we just did, you get roughly 240 spaces for each floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| The structural work this last time around was done where you could add two more floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| It cost $7 million this last time because we had to do, A, the structural work to get it up to where you could build the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| We did plus the two more above it, and then another three for the parking deck itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| So you're looking in the $3 million range if you build another level on that deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| One of the things, and Bob, you and I talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| A number of us have gotten a lot of e-mails today from residents that are downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| and I think it's important that we don't forget about the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| and we don't forget about the folks who have really come downtown and lived downtown, especially the last number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| And so one of the questions came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| One was asked whether or not they could get a guarantee for 10 years at parking at 3250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| It's 90 years, not 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| It's 90 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Well, starting with 10 years, and then after that it goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| But anyway, that was his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| I'm just throwing that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| All things are negotiable in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| The parking rate that we have set now is a city policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| If we were to change that rate, we could change it for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| There could be other deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| As I say, we contract with the public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| If they get written direction from the city of Knoxville to do something along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| then they could possibly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Is that going to happen or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| I would remind you that this rate has been here for quite a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| It enters an incentive to bring people into downtown and to start filling up the upper stories of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| So it's there, and I assume it will track along with the business rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| And that's one reason we've tracked the hotel escalator with the business rate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| But it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| I don't know how probable it is, but it could be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Something to ask the mayor later, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| And then the other thing is that when we added that one floor to the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| I know I was most interested in saying, let's go ahead and do the upper two floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| And I'm glad to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Certainly were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| And I'm glad to see that the one floor is being filled with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| And then also you were talking, we had the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| that the possibility that the hotel would actually take the lower floor possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| The 60 new spaces are coming off Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| You can only enter and exit from Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| We at one time thought it would be a great opportunity to get some, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| some luxury parking down there in the lower level for State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| a little higher level and with some storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| It turned out that's probably not as feasible as we thought it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| but it worked out great for valet parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| And there may be a chance if you do that you get even more than 60 cars parked in that lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| Especially if it's valet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Or somebody, you valet it in, they come out on State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| or they come out on Central, they run to the top of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| and they kind of keep the car circulating that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| So that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| We'll have time to work through those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| What we need tonight is the basic outlines of the lease to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| to keep this project moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Let's review the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| We got $13 million invested in this parking garage a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| when it came before us to add a floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| We argued, I certainly argued, that we build two floors at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| because it's a lot cheaper to build the two floors at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| and avoid the extra mobilization costs, crane costs, and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| on a very narrow site that cuts off road access and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| It was decided, no, that we only build one floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Dr. Lyons has argued, well, we won't really need that extra parking right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| so we'll wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| Right now we have 420 residential units going in in Buzz's Marble City development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| He's allowing spaces for one car per family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| How many families do you know that have two cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| They're going to come to that State Street garage, the nearest garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| and we're going to be out of space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| and we're going to be spending $3 million to accommodate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Right now we have 2,500 spaces in three garages over at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| Is that too far? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| But we only use about 700 or 800 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| We have trolley service that's free and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| We're not using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| In light of that, why can't this hotel either help build an additional floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| by financing part of the cost of building a floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| or B, charge, pay the commercial rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| It costs you $7 a day to park in that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| And I bet Nick Pavlis, when he goes to some posh hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| and stays in a downtown upper-class hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| doesn't blink when they add $7 to the bottom of the bill for the parking charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| We're not building a day's inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| We're fixing up a quality hotel that's historic, unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| meant for the business traveler, you know, a little bit uppity kind of pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| Seven bucks a day helps us pay for our cost of running that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| You may not know this, but our folks at the PGA or whatever the initials are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| PBA spend $332,000 a year to keep up and maintain the State Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| We need income to help pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| And they turn back $450,000 a year to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| No, he told me that they get $500,000 in, and with their expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| they make about $175,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| But more importantly, we built that for citizens and people who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| If the commercial rate is $65 a month, they can pay that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| or they can have their tenants pay $7 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Why are we giving them a dollar a day rental rate for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| and tying up their rights to 160 spaces for 90 years, according to your proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| even if the rate drifts up one-half of whatever the commercial rate is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| That's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| The taxpayers pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| The taxpayers should get to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| We certainly think it is for the taxpayer, and you and I will clearly disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| I appreciate your points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| We struck the best deal we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| We want to get the building occupied, and we want to get it occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| This hotel seems like a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I would mention that this is 160 spaces that are sold every day now for the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| I mean, we don't have to hustle them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| I mean, it's a long-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| We've got 160 spaces, and some nights there might only be 80 people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| If we work out the details, we might have the opportunity to double lease at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| But I can't guarantee that because we haven't worked out how the system would work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| But those are some of the answers to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Any other questions or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| Yeah, I'd just like to add I stay at a Hampton Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| It's not real posh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Do they park your car for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| But I do get muffins in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve the 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| Is this with muffins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Is this with muffins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| The motion passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Let me say thank you for that, and thank you for the ovation earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| It's been a great pleasure to work with this council and all the other councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| It's wonderful to work in the community like I have the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| It's pretty much a shared vision of where we are and where we're going and how we need to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| And I think all of you would agree that that's kind of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| and it's been a pleasure trying to help move us down that road some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| So thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| So, Bob, our law director just showed me a note, a joke you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| that said you have the calmness of a short timer in addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| But the reality is he's had that kind of calmness and that professionalism for all of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| that I've ever seen you at the podium doing this kind of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| People are not going to always agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| You've always done your best job bringing the best deal you can for the taxpayers to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| and I think we all appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| This is the last one I'll be bringing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Don, Michelle, it's up to you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| And you're a three-for-three on this, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Okay, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| 11G is a resolution expressing appreciation to Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| for the donation of a permanent sidewalk easement and temporary construction easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4805)|

| 1:21:38| I kind of feel bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| That was heated and I was wanting to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4905)|

| 1:21:55| because I'm curious what that will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| No, but in all seriousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| I'm the president of the Knoxville Firefighters Association, Local 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| and we're tickled again this year to be a part of helping the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| If you don't mind, can I touch on something real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| Mayor Brown, you mentioned to Chief Sharp about some of the people that were displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| I want you to know that I've been in contact with some of those residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| and we will be meeting with them and giving them a monetary donation to help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| So we're looking out for your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| In the past, since about 2008, I just wanted to touch on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| we've given every year, and you all have accepted graciously, a total of $103,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| And that's not too bad from a little old association down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| So we're pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| I mean, it makes a difference in the children's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| They really absorb this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| Also in the community, we've given $20,000 to the University of Tennessee Cancer Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| and that's touched a lot of people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Everybody in here knows somebody that's been touched with cancer, and it's awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| So we're hoping to try and defeat this awful disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| Also the Red Cross, I can't talk about them enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| Mayor Brown, Shirley, Lori Marsh with the Red Cross, I know she's been in contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| and I personally give her some people's names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| We donated $20,000 to them as well this year to help with displaced families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| not only in Knoxville but surrounding areas, these Tennessee regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| So thank you all for accepting this, and I'll see you again this time next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| with another check if you'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| We are glad to accept your checks for such a worthwhile cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Now I'm going home to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Well, please tell the members of the Firefighters Association how much we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| 11J has a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with K&F Construction, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| in an amount not to exceed $605,000 for the construction of eight miniature buildings at Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| I guess this one just caught my eye just given the size of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| No pun intended there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| It comes from the Safety City Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Is that from grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Is this dedicated money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| How does that funding work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| The Safety City Fund is created by a fee on every citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| It's paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| And it has to be dedicated, I guess, to Safety City?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| I just thought a lot of cruisers or vests or a lot of equipment could be purchased for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| But I know Safety City is a great program, so I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| I was just looking through, and I should have done a little more homework, but what miniature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| buildings, what size square foot are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| Now you're getting technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Well, the supervisor over Safety City is here, Vicki Dagnon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| Vicki, do you have any idea what size these buildings are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| I know they're miniature replicas of our iconic buildings in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| And so I can tell you we have currently, well, she can probably do better than I can since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| she stays out there and manages the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Vicki Dagnon, Safety City Coordinator for Safety City with the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| They're various sizes depending on what it is we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| One of the listings you may see on there is for a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| One's for a post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| We have also a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| So some various things that you would see typically around any city so that the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| in the community, when they come, they recognize it as their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| And those who remain only in their section of their town will be able to see our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| in this facility a little bit more so even when they are not able to travel out of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| small community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| So it's all various sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| You may even notice that there's a nail in the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Well, no, I don't doubt the validity and the enjoyment it brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| And the safety and the issues that it's brought up, it's just, you know, I'm sure it's put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| out to bid like any other job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| I mean, it's, you know, roughly $75,000 per structure looking at 100 square foot average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| for, you know, general construction today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| So I'm just, you know, curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| It just seems like a lot of money for small buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| But thank you for answering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| How many children do we serve each year out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| I have those numbers actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Last year, 15,968 children were served there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| Since opening, 148,000 children have been through Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| And it's targeted to second graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| And so it's been open since 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| And so we've had in the original opening we had three occupied buildings, so buildings that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| actually put people in to work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| And then we had 24 miniature buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| And then since then we've built another occupied building and then 14 additional miniatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| And so this is to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| Actually, these new buildings are actually going to be professionally done just like the last 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5256)|
| 1:27:44| The earlier buildings were actually built by police labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| So this is actually going to give us more professional looking buildings that will last a lot longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| The key here is something to continue into the legacy for our community and teaching safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| Are you building a parking garage there too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| We don't need a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Bicycle slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| We have plenty of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| I was just going to say that you don't have to be a second grader to go out there and enjoy the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5296)|

| 1:28:22| If you haven't been out there, you really need to go take a look because it really is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| And I do know that it seems like an awful lot of money to build those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| but the results of what you have is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| And then also just the whole educational aspect of it for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| But again, you don't have to be a second grader to enjoy it, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| And it is a unique piece where we do have special events out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| So we do have adults come out and enjoy the facility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| How many other cities have something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Do you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| It is very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| It is a gem in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| So I think I've talked to maybe three or four others that have one in their city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| But it's very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Now there's a lot of people who are very envious that come into town and visit and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| So it is something that others would love to have in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Is there a small hotel there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150818?start=5357)|
