| 0:06:54| next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| I wanted to remind everybody, because I've heard about this many times, about issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| on Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=420)|

| 0:07:16| So I'd invite everyone to come out to that if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=436)|

| 0:07:25| So Chief Sharp, we're looking forward to all you can throw at us that morning, and so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| looking forward to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Okay, seeing none, we'll move along to the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2021-2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Motion made to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| And seconded, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| I just have a couple things to call out here, questions to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| As part of this, I believe there's a request for funding of liaison to the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| for legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| I just wanted to, I think that's a first, so I just wanted to ask the goals of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and what the intent is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Yeah, the goals are that we're the only large city in Tennessee that doesn't have help in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| D.C. of this kind, and right now there's a lot of money flowing to cities through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| federal government, and we want to make sure to maximize what Knoxville can get and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| for what's going to make our city stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| So that's why I went up to, when I was up at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| I met with some groups, and this was the one that I thought would be a really good fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| for our purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| So I was really impressed with the work that they're doing for other municipalities already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| and I think that they will be a good return on the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| The other item I was going to ask about was the development agreement with One Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| Deputy Welch, this is something that dates back to 2016 and has to do with the Riverwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Can you give an update on that component, how much it's for, what the plan is to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| that greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| So, thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| So, what this does is it amends the budget to allow us to receive funds from One Riverwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| so that we can complete the connection between the east end of the greenway, just on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| other side of Henley Street Bridge, down to the west end of the greenway, which runs behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| City View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| So, we have five years to complete that from the date that we signed the agreement, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| PBA will be managing that project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| We're very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| This is, you know, just as with our other greenway and sidewalk projects, any time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| we can create connectivity between pieces, it's really important for transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| for recreation, and just for community enjoyment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Well, I want to thank you, commend you for sticking through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| It's not taking the path that we all hoped, but we're going to make lemonade out of lemons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| And I believe it's $2.5 million, and we estimate even, as far as we can tell, that's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| budget to complete the Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Yeah, I mean, at this point, we're estimating that that's enough budget to complete the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| We all, you know, understand what's happening with construction prices these days, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| you know, our goal is to, you know, obviously keep that on budget and make that connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| That's the other piece, is making sure that there's an ADA-accessible route between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| two pieces of the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I want to thank you all for seeing that through, even though it's taken a little bit of a bumpy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| I have a few questions regarding the 12 cadet positions that I sent to Assistant Chief Fortner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=672)|
| 0:11:21| Hopefully you received them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| I was wanting to hear more details behind plans for this recruiting strategy and a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=684)|
| 0:11:37| bit more information about current cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Did you receive those questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Chief Fortner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Could you elaborate a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| How many cadets do we currently have, and what would this expansion do to help the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| and the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| So, currently, we have seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| We have two that we're hiring next week, which will bring it to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| We hope to get it to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| The hope there is that that will be a springboard into the police academy, and they'll be around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| and know what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| And hopefully, instead of having such a high turnover rate or washout rate in the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| these folks will be ready to go and know what to expect, and they'll successfully make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| through the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| And do you have a sense of why KPD chose this strategy for recruitment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| Can you tell us how successful KPD has been in the past recruiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=752)|
| 0:12:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| I think we've been highly successful with our cadets getting into the police academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| and making it through the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| I can't give you an exact percentage number, but from my personal knowledge, it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| a very successful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Council Member Parker, I would just add that this is just one of many strategies that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| using to try to improve recruitment and retention among our law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| And the cadet program, from my understanding, really will help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| First of all, you only have to be 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Whereas to enter the academy, you have to turn 21 during the academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| But also, a lot of people, you know, sometimes we've had people join the academy and meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| the qualifications to enter the academy, but not always have a full understanding of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| being a police officer entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| And then they change their mind, you know, six weeks in, ten weeks in, after a big investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| of their time and our time and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| So my understanding from speaking to Chief Thomas, who couldn't be here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| is that the cadets, that experience gives them a fuller perspective on what being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| police officer would be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| And I'll direct my questions to you, Mayor, because my concerns are the, well, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=840)|
| 0:14:09| multiple concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| One concern is that we're asked to approve an additional $420,000 in annual spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=850)|
| 0:14:19| but we're not given any data, any clear information about the success rate of the program in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=859)|
| 0:14:28| past and why, and the argument for such a significant annual investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| My second concern is, I've been involved in meetings recently with the Boy Scouts program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| that's working to expand their career explorer program, and I know that KPD has the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| explorer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| And so when I looked into that program and compared it with the cadets, the roles seemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| very similar in terms of the activities that they were engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| However, the explorer program does not cost the city $420,000 a year for participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| When I did further research on what other cities were doing, other cities were recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| directly from their explorer program and recruiting young, 14, 15, 16 years old, individuals stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=922)|
| 0:15:31| in the program until 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| At that time, they can enter the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| When I looked up the KPD explorer program, it said that the KPD explorer program encourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| explorers, once they turn 18, to apply to be a cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| And so there doesn't seem to be this intention that individuals would continue on through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| the explorer program and then be recruited as a police recruit once they turn 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| And this is at a much higher expense to the city without showing us any data that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=962)|
| 0:16:10| much higher expense is warranted when the KPD explorer program is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| I just wanted to hear more from the city as to why do we need to make a $420,000 annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=976)|
| 0:16:25| investment without any data behind it when we have an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| Yeah, well, Council Member Parker, my understanding is that the explorer program is like a high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| school club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| It's a voluntary thing, whereas the cadet programs are paid full-time employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| So that's a pretty big distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| Chief Fortner, if you have something to add about that, and then we'll go to Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Fugate, you had some information to share as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| So the explorer program is through the scouts, and it's an all-volunteer thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| We use them basically only for special events, whereas the cadets actually go out and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| full-time employees and are able to take limited, but they can take some enforcement measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Whereas the explorers do not have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you, Chief Fortner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Council Member Fugate, did you have some insight on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Well, one, most scouting programs end at age 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| You age out of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| So that would be one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| The Boy Scout program typically does age out at 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| The explorer program goes through age 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| I just said typically does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| But I actually have a follow-up question related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| How many cadets have we had in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Which is to the question of the money piece, I mean, I assume we've had cadet classes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| were larger in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Yes, we've had the cadet program since 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| I think that first class was 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| And of that 11, six reached full retirement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| Five are still here, but they're where they can retire with full benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| One has already retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| But for the most part, those folks go to the academy, become police officers, and are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| But as far as overall numbers since 1992 to now, we got this question this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| I don't have a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Mr. Brace, did you have some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| I know you're familiar with the Boy Scout elements of the Explorer Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Just from my time as a firefighter, and I'm on the Boy Scout board, so just note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| as well, as is George Shields, one of the staff attorneys here at the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| So I think it's important, and Officer Fortner can talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| We use the Explorer Program to feed our cadet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| We have the Explorer Program at house, rural metro, local fire department has several Explorer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Programs, got some Boy Scouts in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| The Explorer Program is a great exposure program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| It is very economical because we're not paying people full-time with benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| And so we use the Explorer Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| I think the fire department has also in the past utilized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| So it's a program we support, we advocate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| It does feed our recruit classes, our cadet programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| And Mayor, we also are growing our program at Fulton High School with the public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| complex, where we will have, and have right now, an exposure curriculum in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Again, we have higher success rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| We can get those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| I want to say, Chief Fortner, that it's like 80 or 90% of cadets go into the academy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| are successful, but we're going to have to dig into those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| We got the question so late today, we couldn't dig in on the entire history of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| But we will get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| But it's very high, anecdotally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| But we do use the Explorer Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Council Member Parker, there's some other, if you want to, I'll come back to you after Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| Just that my main concern is still that the financial commitment, annual financial commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| is being asked for, even though we don't have answers to these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Well, I think we have some answers that we're having a big challenge recruiting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| And when we go to invest people, invest in their training in the academy, and then they drop out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| or they drop out after six months on the job, that that is not a great investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| So I think the cadet program is going to help us with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| along with many other measures we're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Thank you, Mayor. I have a question for Director Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| This is a budget amendment, and some of this dollars are coming from the unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| As a result of this, what would be our fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| You're correct, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| It will decrease unassigned fund balance by $832,875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| Ms. Juneau, I think you've muted your microphone inadvertently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Sorry. Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Okay. Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| This total amendment will decrease unassigned fund balance by approximately $832,875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1271)|
| 0:21:21| We do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| We talked about our ending fund balance being around $21 million during our mid-year budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| So we certainly feel that we have adequate reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| This is probably directed to Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| So it states here that the total cost of the new positions equates to $420,000 annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| including taxes and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| However, it appears that we are only asking for $105,000 from the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| as relates to this particular amended item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Yes, Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Can you repeat that amount, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Okay. On page one in our packet, it says that to fund these 12 new positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| through the end of FY21-22 will require the transfer of $105,000 from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| For the current year, to finish out the current year, the $420,000 is the full amount annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| which would be reappropriated in the FY23 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220322?start=1365)|
