| 0:02:58| Sir, I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and I'll ask you to answer audibly to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| the laws against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| or any crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Has beer been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| There is a license on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| Do you have the license with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| No, I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| The previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Okay, but because we'll need to have that surrendered, the preexisting license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| I think SlateOver has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Now, it appears, reading from the agenda, you're seeking an on and off-premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Would you explain that to the board, why you feel you need an off-premises for a bar and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Just for to-go purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Mr. Law, the record, could you ask him to speak more into the mic, because I can't hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| For to-go purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| So you're operating a package business out of this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Could you define that for us, to-go purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| Somebody walked in and wanted to take out, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Would this be a sealed container?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Okay, so in other words, we're not talking about buying a cocktail and then walking across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Well, we ask that because actually some people presume that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Any questions relative to that part of the application, members of the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Do you serve food and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Because I have a pretty big concern about on and off-premises, and I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| that you're aware that it's illegal for you to sell alcohol to someone that has been drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| or appears to be intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Are you aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Sir, do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| So I presume it's being leased from whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| Dwayne Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Who else has an interest in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| That is my wife and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations, and do you agree to conduct your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Yes, I am, and yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| We both have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Members of the board, any questions before I defer to the departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Mr. Chair, I guess I want to kind of pull the string on what Commissioner Anders started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| I'm trying to get an understanding on the flow of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| So you have food, and you'll be able to serve, if we grant this license, you'll be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| And then you're wanting them to be in a position to buy a can of beer or a six-pack of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| to take home with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| I'm trying to understand this on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| If somebody wanted to take a six-pack or buy a six-pack to take with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| So I guess, is that, you know, again, I'm new to this, so please mind my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=355)|
| 0:06:03| Is that what's normally done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| Is that what we normally like for our licensees to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| Generally, sir, to begin, it is permissible, generally, if an institution or an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| is selling liquor only, and just maybe perhaps bar snacks, pretzels, et cetera, we kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| you know, shy away from the off-premises sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| If someone's actually selling foodstuffs, food to go, and they want to likewise sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| sealed containers, and they comport with the law in terms of age, no level of intoxication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| then it's permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| So it's realistically within the board's, you know, purview to make that inquiry and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| decide whether or not they feel it's appropriate for this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:52| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| I'm sorry for the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Do you have a liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| No, sir, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| I really do have a heartache with an on-and-off-premise beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| I just think it, you know, you could let a guy come in there and have lunch, have a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| at lunch, construction worker, whatever, and then him buy a six-pack, and I have a bellyache| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| I think it's too dangerous for you guys to regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Although it is permitted under law, I'd like for us to take steps in the future to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| that ability, but I just want to make sure that you're aware that we're going to be watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| closely if you have an on-and-off, if you're granted an on-and-off-premise beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| because I think it's extremely dangerous, and I think you need to think about the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| issue that you have with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| For the reasons that have been cited, I can't vote for on-and-off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| In fact, I cannot imagine any situation other than, say, perhaps a boat dock, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=472)|
| 0:08:01| where they have a restaurant, but they're also selling beer for people to take out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| their boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| I can't imagine any situation other than that where I would support both on-and-off-premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| I've just seen it cause a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| So if it stands as it is, then I will vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| If there's a motion made to grant one or the other, I would support it, but I can't vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| for on-and-off in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Mr. Law Director, would this come back, if something ever happened, would that come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| to the owner also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Could something come back to that individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Yes, sir, under the theory of premises liability, unless they've contracted that liability away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| you'd have, as you're aware, insurance issues, curtilage issues, et cetera, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:59| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Have we ever issued an on-and-off-premises beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| So are we just concerned about this particular one or is there others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Well, on his application here, he doesn't have a restaurant checked, he has a tavern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| checked, and I think there's a difference in a deli with a beer cooler versus a tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| Tavern has limited menu and more beer than food, and I just, I'm kind of concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| If it's within the parameters of the law, I don't think we can vote against it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| I just think it's a bad idea, and I want him to understand the liability he's facing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| That would be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| We have talked to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| No ownership change has been applied for as of yet, and no permit has been, the permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| process has not been started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Sir, state your name and who you represent for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| I'm Scott Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I'm the environmental manager for Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Beer Board Inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Have you all got them to us yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| No, they haven't got them to us yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| We took the class a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Excuse me, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| We can't have you speaking off record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| We have to have a recording of this, so if you're going to have a conversation, it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| to be, we can pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| I asked them about their certification card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| And?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| We don't have them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| They've not got them back to us yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Okay, but when did you complete the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| A week ago, Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Okay, that's not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Any other questions, Mr. Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| No, it's not unusual, but they'd have a receipt or they went through the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| Mr. Lauder, I've got a question for Beer Inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| UK, in your opinion, what Mr. Armstrong or what Mr. Andrews was saying, do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| he should have checked something other than tavern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Should he have checked restaurant or something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| In my opinion, it either ought to be one or the other, not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| What we run into, the first thing they do is want to go out on the deck and drink their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| beer, then out on the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| It either should be on-premise or off-premise, to make it and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=683)|
| 0:11:33| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| My last question for the applicant, based on the discussion you've heard up here, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| you had a preference, which of those would you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| On-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| On-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Mr. Minot, is that on-premise a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| Is that on-premise okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| You said either or, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| On-premise is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| I've been there for, I spent a business there for the last 20 years, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Then I'll make a motion that we approve on-premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| What was the previous permit, on and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| The application is for on and off, and just if I can, we still haven't finished with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| yet, so we want to make sure you have that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| And further, just be advised, Mr. Minot mentioned that they then want to take it out on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| That's permissible under Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Tennessee law and the Attorney General's consistently ruled that if you have a tavern or a bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| and adjacent to that is a deck or a porch, beer is permitted there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| We have approved several places on and off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| In this situation, though, should they have said restaurant as opposed to tavern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| Because I don't want to get into an issue where we're discriminating against these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| folks if other people have had it, unless we change our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Well, the question would be, it would go to exactly what the scope of the business is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| which we can't really tell from the documentation provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| It would be helpful if the applicant would describe the entity so we have a better feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| if, in fact, it's correctly categorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| But what is the rule of thumb for on versus off premise for both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| If you want to do both, what, as a business, do you have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| Well, the law doesn't distinguish between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| It's just that if you're going to, you know, it's preferred that it's a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| to have both because it goes then with the ability to have takeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| But the law doesn't distinguish between the two in terms of on or off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| So we're kind of in a gray area here is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Well, we are, sir, and we have to oftentimes take it on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| If we feel this particular location is not suitable for that for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| then we can articulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| And if the applicant is not satisfied, we can litigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| But there is no, you know, blanket ruling handed down from the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| that basically advises us as to what the litmus test is for on and off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| just that provided they don't serve open container and they comport with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Is there something we could do to help strengthen that in our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| to help better define if you want both on and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Well, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| We'd have to ensure that it doesn't run afoul of the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| We can certainly research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Sir, would you describe for the Board this business exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| where you feel the majority of your sales come from, how it's structured, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| The majority of the sales would certainly be alcohol sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| So you're comfortable saying you're a tavern, not a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| I just assumed that it would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| The previous owner had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| I have myself in the past, not recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| but I've stopped by taverns and picked up a six on the way home before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| Do we have the previous license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Do you know if it's on or off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| The previous license apparently is on and off as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| and that, of course, brings us into the Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| that says if the previous license was issued to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| unless we have a solid legal reason why we should not approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| really you're pretty much hemmed in to approving that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| if the product was previously issued at that same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Pending re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| I'll defer to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Well, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| I'll make a substitute motion that we approve the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| as is pending health and fire and getting their carts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| I think, and anything else that may need to be pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| I just had a question for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I don't know what the previous beer board was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| when they issued on and off premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| but I don't understand how we're forced to vote for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| when the majority of this Board believes that it's inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I mean, I believe that the law states that you can issue both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| for the situations like have been suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| a boat dock where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| you have both people eating at the restaurant at the boat dock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| and buying beer to take out to the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| The situation where you've got a carry-out place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| where they can sell beer to take home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| when you're taking carry-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| You know, I believe that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| there's a huge change sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| and a board can have a different opinion today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| than they did five years ago based on attitudes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| And so I'm wondering why would we legally be forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| to do something that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| the majority of this Board disagrees with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Well, sir, again, I didn't say you must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| All I'm telling you is that the way the law reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| if there's a preexisting license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| and there's no definitive reasons why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| your decision will be subject to challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| I'm not saying you must do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Again, as Commissioner Hammond raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| there is no black-letter law, no litmus test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| I'm just telling you that based upon the facts before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| there's been no extenuating circumstances issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| for instance, that they're running illegal gambling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| or it's a nuisance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| then the standard protocol would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| that they have a preexisting license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| liquor's been sold there in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| they've made an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| and if you say, well, we don't care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| we're going to vote against it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| that's your privilege as this Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Just understand that it is subject to challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| and we may end up litigating, we may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| That's the only reason I bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Here's what my fear is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| and I don't know how this Board's going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| I know I'm going to vote against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| if it's both, just strictly on principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| I don't know why it was issued before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| and I can't support it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| What if this motion fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| and they don't get any beer permit whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Wouldn't that also expose us to possible litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Any time you deny a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| for which you can't articulate a legal or factual reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| of course, you'll be challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Mr. Lambert, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| To answer your question, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| my motion is a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| and if it fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| we go back to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| which is Commissioner Brown's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| which is the on-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Seeing no other lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| Come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| But, you know, I've only been on this Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| since we started meeting all at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| but I know for a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| that we have issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| a license to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| who took over existing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| and we made it on-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| So in terms of precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| we've already been down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| We had a long discussion about that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| So this, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| and I understand the legal department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| trying to keep us out of any additional legal action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| but I don't think this is the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| that we've dealt with this type of license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| And I'm pretty sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| in the previous instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| we granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| we did not grant it on and off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| We granted it on-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I don't believe that was an existing beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| that a guy had already had somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| or the owner had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| He just checked both boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| just out of the sake of checking both boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| and he agreed with us and took a on-premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I don't think there was a contested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Right, it wasn't contested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| but I think the business was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| He was taking over the business, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| He had the same rights as this gentleman and lady had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Also, the motion is pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| the previous owner turning in their license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| and closing out their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| We have a substitute motion to approve both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| I think we need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Let's have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1232)|

| 0:22:58| On.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1378)|

| 0:23:23| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations and do you agree to conduct your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1408)|

| 0:23:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1412)|

| 0:23:34| This week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1414)|

| 0:23:49| Refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Within the last couple of months, we did something with this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| What did we do, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| There's another, Woods, I believe, applied for a beer license and he couldn't agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| So, he withdrew his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1436)|

| 0:24:11| He withdrew his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I will say, while I've got the floor, that this has been in existence for 40 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:27| Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| And I don't know that it's caused any problems, so I would make a motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:38| Sir, I still have to address staff, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| No issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| We've spoken with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| It seems he's going to be doing can and bottle beer only, plastic cups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| No additional permits be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| In March of the 7th, 2007, Mr. Gordon Ray Casey was charged with selling to underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1497)|
| 0:25:08| drink, for underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| He was put on, he was fined, but put on diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| And KPD caught him and wrote the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| So you're saying it was diverted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Diversion with a plea of guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Members of the Board, if an individual goes through a diversionary program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| it does not count as a conviction under Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| That's not to say you have to ignore the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| It's just that we can't presume it to be a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| What was that for, Mr. Casey, unless you're not comfortable speaking about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| An underage cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| And you made the sale as the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Board inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Certification only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Pending re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I'll defer to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Let me add that pending these items needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| This law director would it be appropriate, since the conviction is not on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| that this gentleman send us something in writing as to steps he intends to take to make sure that minors are not being served in his establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:32| I don't think that's unreasonable to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Not at all, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| If the good commissioner would make it a part of his motion, then we can ensure that it's part of the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I will add that as part of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| This will be done within 30 days or the action we take here is invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| So we'll need to have some kind of statement from you as to what you intend to do to prevent your employees as evil at your place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Is it 21 and up only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Are you doing 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Does the second agree to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1626)|

| 0:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| I didn't see you from my vantage point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1676)|

| 0:28:13| It's already been surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| And I understand this is for off premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1696)|

| 0:28:22| And what is your relationship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Are you leasing it from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Just leasing, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Who else will have an interest in this business professionally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1706)|

| 0:28:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I plan on hiring employees eventually, but we've not opened it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| And I do understand in so doing you need to get them certified and go through the server training course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations, and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1729)|

| 0:28:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| I'll defer to the Board for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| We still have to hear from staff, but if I could, but I believe you have two other questions, sir, beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| I didn't see the lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I just want to make sure correctly, you're 22 years old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Twenty-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Twenty-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| And you're going to be running this business on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| There's not a parent, grandparent, anyone else involved in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Well, I'm going to vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| and I want to congratulate you on being so ambitious at such a young age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| but I want you to know that I am going to ask the law enforcement to keep a really close eye on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Peer pressure is a bad thing, and I don't want to see your friends that are under 21 pressure you into selling them beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| but I do congratulate you for being so ambitious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| I just want to say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| The people sitting right behind you, that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| They will come, and they will check you out, and we wish you the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| but congratulations on being a 21-year-old trying to start your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| so we appreciate your entrepreneurship in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| I'll hear from staff if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Members of the Board of Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| No issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| She's applied for a permit and received one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| I'll defer to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Commissioner Pinkston, did you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| I'd like to add a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| I'm not sure about some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| You all know who other commissioners know, the ones in your area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| but this is the third or fourth turnover that we've had along the Chapman Highway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| in the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| It kind of disturbs me somewhat that the reason for all of these is that people can't make a go of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1855)|
| 0:31:07| It's not what they thought it was, and sometimes they take shortcuts to try to make it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| So I'd like to reiterate what was said about the checks and balances on you, hon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| We're going to have to do that, not only with you but with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| And I say I'm not sure what's happened to some of these other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| but I know this is about the fourth right along that corridor that we've had two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| or three changeovers in the same place in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| The same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I don't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Yours was about four months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Yeah, the guy that was there before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| I don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| We have a motion on the floor and a property second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| The only thing before the Board remaining is you have letters before you based upon the Board's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| that vendors submit to you in writing the steps they've taken to preclude further violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| I believe that's all before the Board, and I'll defer to the Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| I've got a question on our application where it says you are a rear loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| where it says they've got to have a valid business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| If that business tax is not valid, what steps can they take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| That's a legal question, Mr. Chairman, if you want me to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| If the clerk of court reports to us that a person is in arrears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| then we initiate collection proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| In terms of whether or not that nullifies a preexisting beer license, the law is unsettled on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| But in terms of enforcing the taxing issue, that's a clerk of the court issue, a separate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| They would come to us, and then we would do what we can to collect the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Mr. Law Director, what I've done for the last 18 years, when I've found them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| the business tax is good from year to year with a 60-day grace period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| And after the grace period is up, I've told the people to stop selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| until they come and renew that business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| Can that not still be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Have you had any refresher training in the law over these last 18 years regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| I mean, the law has been in a constant state of flux, and I don't want you to be put in a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| You represent this board, and when you're out there, you're the agent of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| which means this board can incur liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| So I think before we start making that, we need to research that further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| and I'll confer with you on that off the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| I'd like for Sergeant May to speak to this, please, about the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| and the reason that the public is telling us why they don't get it in on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| Allen Wolfie May, Noscan Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| I've had, Lieutenant Brown and I have had a couple of conversations in the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| It's about the end of the year, like of December 31, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| The people don't get their license or taxes and everything filled out, usually until March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| even though what Mr. Miner is talking about takes place in January, that it comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| So they're usually March before they ever get their taxes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| because they can't use the 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| They have to use 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| It has to be a current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| So that's the problem where the money, they can't pay their tax because they don't have the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| It's just like us paying income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Our check stubs, we don't get our W-2s there until the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| Businesses are having the same problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| and they're not able to pay the tax until February or March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Any questions from the Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| So where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Well, what we'll do is, first of all, Walt, I can talk to the Clerk of Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| and see to ensure that there's no glitch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| and then I'll work with Mr. Minot in terms of the enforcement mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| So are we still going to be able, are we still pulling, or I guess I'm looking for action from here out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| Can Mr. Minot go in and pull the beer license and tell them to stop selling beer until they've paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| It's a separate issue, and one is not tied to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| at least within the Tennessee Code or in your ordinance at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| So I think Prudence dictates we ensure that we can actually tie the two because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| you've got a separate enforcement mechanism with the Clerk of the Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| a separate elected official who's monitoring that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| but the law, the beer law, doesn't really, it's not designed for one to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| They work independently of one another, I guess is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I'm wondering if, because he is an agent of this Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| if rather than him pulling it and telling them they can't sell, that he bring it before the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| That would be the preferred methodology because, again, if he's incorrect, then, and we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| an action is filed, we'd have little defense if he's in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| Mr. Chairman, there hasn't been a license pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| All that I've told the people, stop selling until you get downtown and renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| It takes about an hour for them to drive down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Nobody's been hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| No license has been pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| And, anyway, we're not going to have to worry about it because I think we've been lax in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| and the state's going to take it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| So Knox County is going to lose a bunch of money over business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| Mr. Stolfi, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Getting back to the letters that were written to us, I think we should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| I'm going to make a motion that we accept these letters just so that we have official record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| that they've been accepted since we had a motion last month that they better write them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| So I think we need to officially accept them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| I move and second that we officially accept the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| In relation to the discussion we were just having previously about these taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| I can understand, based on officers' testimony here, that there can be some time drag in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:08| which could be up to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| So what if we put a resolution in that after 60 days they are not paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| He has the authority to suspend them legally until they're paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:29| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| The clerk and I were discussing the preexisting permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Can you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Based on the discussion we were having about the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| it seems that around 60 days is the time limit on which they should have everything available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| to do what they need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Can we pass a resolution stating that after 60 days these are not paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| that we legally authorize Mr. Minot to suspend the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| Well, that would actually, you have a beer ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| You'd actually have to amend your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| But prior to doing that, I would be more comfortable if we researched that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Because, again, the way the State has established the State beer laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| they've deferred to counties to issue beer licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| But the problem you have is you're exacting a fee for the beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| and you have a certain set of criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| then basically then telling them because they're in arrears to the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| you're going to go back and nullify that license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| So that would require some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| I can have that to the Board within a week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| And then if it's feasible and that's the Board's desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I'll come back with an amended ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| I'd like to ask Ms. Catherine Brunson to come forward, if she would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| And each of us has a package here that we asked for last month in regards to some of these sales to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:08| We asked what materials were being handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| She's put together in a package here, a package for each one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| I'd like for her to take a minute to tell you what these things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| And she also asked me to remind you they are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| If you're not going to take it and use it in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| please give it back to them so they can pass it to those where it really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I think the bags are pretty self-explanatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| but we try to provide materials and or strategies for new businesses to prevent them from having underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| We actually have another meeting tomorrow with some retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| and are in the process of developing some more materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| They are free to any of the retailers that want to use them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| and we thank you very much for the funding that we receive that provides these materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| But we do appreciate if you don't want the bag to take home, if you would give those back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Catherine, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| Catherine Brunson, 9413 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Seeing none, can I get a motion for a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Motion adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Well, no, we'll be back for 20 minutes for a regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:27| I hope there's no indication how the regular meeting is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Three little items, 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| In your dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| We'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=2503)|

| 1:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| This is a particular one that presents some troubles to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| I've done a little research here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| As far as I can tell, Mr. Paul Fortunato is a good actor in a tough position, but he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| with Roman Haas, a major polluter in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| I'm sure he's doing his best there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| When I looked at the toxics release data, whose data unfortunately are not up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| because the previous administration cut back toxic release information, but nevertheless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| it's among the lower performing in terms of environmental quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| Furthermore, it's been acquired by Dow Chemical, not known for its good pollution record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| I just wonder where we're going with the Air Pollution Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| Do we have a fox in a hen house problem here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| The citizen rep I've since learned on the board is a TVA spokeswoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| So I'm just wondering, yes, we have a good medical rep, and yes, these people have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| garnered some experience over time, but I'm just wondering if we need to rethink our composition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| of this board and maybe put some more folks on it with a citizen or environmental perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| I think that would be a reasonable thing to do, and I think a reasonable substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| would be to extend the current terms by 30 days and to defer this motion 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| Commissioner McKenzie, you're going to speak to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| I'll just speak in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| As I've been looking at this, I agree with Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| I think it does need a little more citizen involvement, and I struggle to say greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:55| accountability because everyone's working hard and budgets have been cut, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| this is a serious issue that needs additional care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:10| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Ms. Liddington, we greatly respect you and your ability to understand the needs of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:23| Air Pollution Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Would you speak to some of the issues that Dr. Harmon has brought up about composition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| of the board, other members too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| I think maybe Mr. Fortunato was the focus at the committee meetings, but I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| about Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| I think he's maybe an allergist or in the medical profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| Would you just speak to the issue of the composition of the board for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Lynn Liddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| I'm the Director of Knox County Air Quality Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Going down the list of these board members, this was passed out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| I believe it was in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| One of the commissioners sent a request last week to know how long some of these board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| members had been on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| We researched back on that and came up with this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| I'll start with Dr. Wayne Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| There's only nine members on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Dr. Wayne Davis is an internationally known expert in air quality, has been on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| for a...actually since 1984, we're very fortunate to have his expertise on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:32| He's the...I believe he is now the head of the engineering department at the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Mr. Paul Fortunato with Roman Haas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| Roman Haas is in compliance with all regulations, all air quality regulations, and has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| They are not even a Title V source, which is what our big polluters are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| Unfortunately, our number two polluter is the University of Tennessee, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5037)|
| 1:24:09| Roman Haas, although they are a chemical plant, not a good idea to have them located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| in the middle of the city, but that's how things turn out, and that's the hand we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| They have an amazing safety record at that facility, and now with Dow Chemical, buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| them, Dow Chemical is even more stringent and makes them do even more things to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| sure we have no toxic releases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| Brent Johnson is the newly appointed representative from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| He is also an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Terry Sisk is a representative from Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5084)|

| 1:24:50| Lisa Stanton, who this board has had on here for the longest time, dating back to 1979,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:59| which was two years before I came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| He has been with Oak Ridge, is an environmental engineer, has been a very valuable member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| and speaks very well for the citizens of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Jeff Welch with the Knoxville Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| Most of our pollution now that we're getting TVA under control is coming from the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Therefore, having somebody from NBC, from our regional transportation planning organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:35| and the county's representative, Bruce Weitrick, who is also in transportation, has been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| valuable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Steve Hillenbrand represents the Technical Societies of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| He is an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Dr. Michael Miller, as Commissioner Briggs probably knows, it's difficult to get a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| doctor to be able to serve on these boards, to have the time for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| Dr. Miller, an allergist, is a great person to have on an air quality board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| They understand the issues that we're faced with each and every day with particulate matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| especially PM2.5 and ozone, being inhaled and causing respiratory problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| All of these board members, when you put them together, make an excellent group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| This actually comes out of the Clean Air Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| These are federal regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| The design of this board was designed at that level as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| If you look at the State Air Board, it's very similar in composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| It has more members, but a very similar composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:43| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| She answered my question about who was on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Commissioner Brawls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| I don't particularly have any problem with any particular person who's on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| My feeling, especially looking over this list, is that a lot of people have been on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| for a long, long time, and I'm sure that they do a great job and that the citizens of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| County have been well served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| I just think it's time for some new people to be rotated onto this board, not to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| that the people who have been serving all this time have not done exceptionally well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| I just think it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| There's some people who are interested in serving on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| I think it's time for somebody else to take a turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| I will point out that the longest serving member is appointed by the Commission itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| That has been this Commission's choice to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| Do we have something else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Substitute motion to continue the ones that's already on it for 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| Who were the ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| It's four ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| So it failed 15 to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| If you see the noes, there could be abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| You were a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| You were a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Did you abstain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Are you an aye or an aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| I see the noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| You're a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Even if there were abstentions, it fails for lack of 10 positive votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| I just want a full record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5314)|

| 1:37:48| June Griffin, I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| My name is June Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| I live at 522 Crestview in Dayton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| The last time I addressed your commission was on a tour that I made throughout Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| where I presented a Bill of Rights resolution that counties have a right to post the Ten Commandments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| It was highly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| Eighty-five of the 95 counties in Tennessee said we have a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| Our position has been to take the Bill of Rights back under its rightful owner and the author of our salvation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:30| I have intervened in the lawsuit that the ACLU brought against your library pertaining to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:40| pornographic literature that was going to pollute the minds of your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| I filed a counter complaint, and so the ACLU said they didn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| Either they want to have me for hamburger meat or they're going to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| Hopefully, they will back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| I expect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| My position has been that they are in violation of the Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| Title 42 U.S.C. 1988 is the means by which the ACLU has robbed our treasuries since the inception of that Title 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:17| They made $459,000, for instance, taking out the Ten Commandments out of the Alabama courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| They have become vastly wealthy by using 1988 as a means to make us pay for our destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:33| So I entered objection to that, that if they are so dedicated to their cause, let them finance their own way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:41| as we have done all these years, and let's at least be honest about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| If they're dedicated to destroying God and country, then let them pay their own legal bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| Secondly, this motion by which they moved against your county is in collision with two other sections in the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=5992)|
| 1:40:03| and in the Title, for instance, Title 28 and also in 1983,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| where it says that nobody has a right to interfere with anybody's Bill of Rights or any of their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| So we have a situation here that's in violation of our Tennessee Constitution, Article 1, Section 2 of the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| which says the doctrine of nonresistance to arbitrary power is abusive and slavish and absurd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:30| and is therefore condemned in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| So, therefore, if a judge has to pick and choose from three different provisions, he is under arbitrary power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| And so, therefore, he is in violation of our Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| This was established, again, even though our Declaration of Rights can never be abrogated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| upon which you all took a sacred oath, and it is forever to remain inviolate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| So, therefore, the ACLU is also in violation of this in taking away our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| I gave to each one of you all a little booklet that was put out by the American Legion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| I'm a proud member of the American Legion Auxiliary, and even though this is not entered under their auspices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| I used that booklet to show that the American Legion in 2004 at their convention in Nashville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:21| passed a resolution to do away with this provision under which the ACLU is getting paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:28| especially when it comes to these issues of our rights, our heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| How this will go, we are under God's auspices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:44| It is wrong for our counties to have to continue to pay these lawyers while they run over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:52| What I have to say to you will cost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| It will cost you nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Unfortunately, it will make you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| When there was no one to represent God in the Bible in the Tennessee sodomy case, I intervened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| And by God's grace and mercy, I was allowed to argue for God in the Bible before the Tennessee Appeals Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:17| And I pointed out that they had to decriminalize sodomy in order to get on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| We are being made to pay for the demoralization of our country, of our counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| On the other hand, 85 of the 95 counties, and I would have them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| we only had one county to vote against that Bill of Rights resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| That was Williamson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Other nine counties would have joined with the other 94 had they not been afraid of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:52| Why should we as Tennesseans be oppressed anymore for fear of a lawsuit whereby we have to pay left-wing lawyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6172)|
| 1:43:02| That's my whole position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| We did this on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| It was something the Lord said do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| What I'm giving you today is a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| I hope that those of you who do know our God and our heritage will pray for this suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| And it is time to put a stop to this robbery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| Thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Mike Arms, Chief of Staff, Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| I want to briefly communicate to you somewhat of a reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| Last month we talked about the fact that Eric Hoagland was leaving Knox County to distinguish employment with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| over our grants program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| We're going to streamline our grants and community outreach and Office of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| and combine that into the Office of Neighborhoods and community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| So we'll not be replacing Eric's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| Grant will be supervising that entire structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| We'll be moving Deborah Porter into doing more of the Office of Neighborhoods work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| She's doing community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| So what we're trying to do is streamline our organization, not replace an employee, but be more efficient and effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| We feel like we have developed a cadre of strong grant managers who will be assigned individual grants, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| for JAG grant, energy efficiency grants, community block grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| And then the Office of Neighborhoods, I think it's natural for Deborah to do more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| And we're going to try to take that organization a step further this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| I know we have, for instance, office, I mean, neighborhood nights out that you're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| We're going to try to reach out to a lot of these nonprofit community organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| and look for ways to help them other than direct funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Commissioner Hammond, you know, we've already met with the Dogwood Arts Festival, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| There's organizations out there like the Hispanic Cultural Festival that we do not directly fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| but there's ways we can help them through website development and through promotion through our libraries and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| So we're looking at more ways to reach out and stay connected with our stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| But what we're doing is basically consolidating those two organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| and trying to do the job without hiring another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| That's one thing I wanted to tell you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| And closely connected to that, we are applying this very week, I think the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| for $2.1 million of energy efficiency grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| And that's stimulus money through the Department of Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| And, of course, if we successfully are awarded that grant, and we think we will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| it will be brought back for the county commission to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| But it's such a magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| I want to tell you just briefly a little bit about it because you might start hearing from some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| These energy efficiency and conservation block grants, the $2.1 million will be actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:57| 64 different energy conservation measures that we've identified working with TRAIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| So when we went into this grant application, we were what was called shovel ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| Many counties are actually applying for money to hire people or to hire auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| We're way ahead of that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| That 64 energy conservation measures will be in the buildings we own and in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| So here's some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| We're going to look at new lighting system upgrades, some HVC upgrades, window treatments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| power system upgrades, chiller replacements, exhaust air recovery upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| changing out the lights and traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| The biggest project is going to be a solar thermal hot water project at the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| which we think will save $60,000 a year in our gas bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| The goal of all this is to reduce our energy consumption by 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| We think we're going to meet that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Also, commissioners, one of the things we're talking about air pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| we think we can reduce our CO2 emissions by 10 million pounds per year with some of these additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| So you'll be hearing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| We're going to submit that grant this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Also, we're putting out a whole energy strategy as part of this DOE grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| And it will talk about a $10 billion worth of work we'd like to do in Knox County facilities to save energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| reduce emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| Finally, two other quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Beck Cultural Center groundbreaking is this Friday at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| That's June the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| Next Thursday, July the 2nd, at 10 o'clock, will be the Shumpert Park ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| I think you got notices on those, but I know your calendars get full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| So two important dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| I think we have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Mike, right over here, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| These people that receive these grants, they're supposed to report back to us, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| They certainly are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| And every grant recipient has to now have on file with their county clerk a document that puts the states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6473)|
| 1:48:02| their nonprofit organization, their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| They submit a statement that they have no conflicts of interest with Knox County positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| And it's supposed to give the mission statement of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| And just last week, the mayor gave $1,000 of discretionary money from one organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| We made them fill out that form and submit it to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| Then we go back and I think on a quarterly basis, they're supposed to submit reports on what they're doing with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:32| So we make sure it's spent for the purpose that they requested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| But reading the charter, I didn't know you were going to talk about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| I believe they are supposed to come before the county commission according to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| and tell us how this money is being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| Well, I assume I can send reports back before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| I know we're sending reports back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Before the county commission, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| I don't know who they've been reporting to, but they haven't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| I've been here five years and they've never been up here to where we can ask them any questions or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| I'd like for Grant, since it's going to be going into his department or whatever there, to check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| And if that's the way it's supposed to be, if the charter hadn't been amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| I'd like to see them start coming up here in front of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| If the commission is so pleased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| I guess we're going to have quarterly reports of all those organizations telling us what to do with their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| And keep in mind, Commissioner, some of that money is awarded by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| So, ironically, we had a couple of organizations who have decided they didn't want to go through the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| and scrutiny of the dollar amounts we were giving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| Well, I'm not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| I know we have to approve all of it, even the discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| No, but what I'm saying is if they're supposed to report to us, I'd like for them to report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| It would have been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| There may be questions I may want to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| And I think the taxpayers and citizens of Knoxville deserve some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| They may not want to ask them anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| But if the charter says they're going to report to us, I think they should report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| And I think we set up a system a year or so ago for more reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| If it's the commission's pleasure, we can schedule that on a quarterly basis and have them all here to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| Some of them spend their money over different schedules, different points in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| So, you may want to have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| That would be a big group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| So, let us know how often you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| Yeah, I was just going to echo what Mr. Arms just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| I think that if we are going to start hearing from these folks, and I think it's a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| it needs to be in a separate meeting from a regular commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| because I could imagine that filling a few hours within itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6656)|

| 1:51:19| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| We don't have any drives and roads, so our first resolution would be 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:28| This is on page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6688)|

| 1:52:01| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| Whereas, Mariah Goss recently achieved the rank of valedictorian at Fulton High School, and whereas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| attaining valedictorian status is such an exceptional milestone in one's life and academic career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| and whereas, as evidenced by Mariah's academic success, she is a very bright, disciplined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| and motivated young woman who understands the value of an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6748)|

| 1:53:56| I guess I'd like to say I had the pleasure of knowing Mariah's father most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6836)|
| 1:54:02| and actually graduated high school with her uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=6842)|

| 1:57:00| 19 years of education and service at Gresham Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7020)|

| 1:57:12| and is in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7032)|

| 1:57:19| We went on through, believe it or not, we got trouble in talking in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| And we went on and we graduated from Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| And look at Mr. Bullis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| He has become an educator of our future leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| So, it's very much an honor to always represent our educators as I feel like they are overlooked a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:41| And I'm so thankful to represent and honor one of my old classmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7061)|

| 2:00:22| I think this is the time to explain some of these TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| I know a lot of these people here don't understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| And, Mr. Peterson, would you tell them why KCD applies for this for the city instead of the developer and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:38| I just think people need to understand a little bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| I'm Don Peterson with KCDC 901 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| By state law, TCA code, as the city's redevelopment authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| we are charged with being the carrier and the administrator for the TIFs in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7253)|
| 2:01:03| And you do this in all development inside the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| All redevelopment areas within the city limits that are commissioned for redevelopment plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| And you also do nothing for the IDB board, that's the county's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| No, sir, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| I just thought these things need to be made clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| KCD is not on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| They're not renting it or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| They're applying for the TIF for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| On behalf of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| I just wanted everybody to understand that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| Commissioner Shelf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| I'm going to ask the gentleman a brief question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| Is part of the key word redevelopment, if a developer, say, wanted to put a TIF, a big box, as we call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:48| in the city on Mercer's Drive, say, and apply for a TIF, would you be involved in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| or is this just for redevelopment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| I would just call that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| Is the redevelopment the key?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| Anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| In order for it to be a TIF, to qualify for a TIF that we deal with, it has to be in a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| Not like if there's a field on Mercer's Road and a guy or Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| and the developer wants to put a Wal-Mart in there, you're not involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| No, it's just a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| He may come in and ask for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| It has nothing to do with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| All in favor, say, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7356)|

| 2:02:39| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| This is a resolution approving an amendment to the Central Business District, West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| redevelopment and urban renewal plan and providing tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| Any finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| Nine-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7370)|

| 2:02:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7377)|

| 2:03:00| All in favor, say, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7380)|

| 2:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| Resolution 906 is approving a policy to clarify the use of take-home vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| and other policies now currently in place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Nine-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Seven-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| This is Commissioner Hammond's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| I'm just wondering what we have currently in our online and other printed form are just two memos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:38| Is your intent, Commissioner Hammond, to implement these two memos as a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| or would you like to substitute a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| I know that at the last fleet meeting I distributed a five-page policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| which I'd be happy to distribute again like a substitute motion if you're so inclined to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:57| That's my intent is to have one policy and not dueling policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| so I will defer to your policy because I think it's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| So what I will do is make a substitute motion to defer the to implement the policy being distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:14| If I could ask Joe Lee to distribute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| For those of you who didn't see this on the commission website after the latest fleet meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| this is, in effect, a five-page policy that incorporates many of the cities, many of Nashville's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:28| many of some other communities' policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| It was made available to all commissioners and anyone attended who wanted a copy of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| and it was put on the commission forum for any and all to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| So I thought why not just go with that, and that's my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:47| It's not a substitute, it's an original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| An original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Do we have a second to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| Commissioner Harmon, has this been reviewed by the law department as to applicability of elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:13| or is it just going to be for the administrative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| Well, I will defer to the law department to see if the law department has looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| But you haven't submitted it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| I believe I gave the law department a copy when the fleet vehicles meeting was held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:32| Mr. Jarrett, have you reviewed the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| Yes, I reviewed all of the policies that were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| I wasn't aware that this was actually going to come before the board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| My only question would be the scope as to the intent in terms of is this presumed to be countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:55| or just within the purview of the county commission and the county executive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| If I can get that clarification, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| What I'd like to do is introduce a substitute motion to defer for at least 30 days based on the fact that it's brand new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| and the law department hasn't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:09| I would point out that it's not quite brand new and the law department has read it, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| I would also like to add to that if Mr. Andrews will agree that the department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:21| that be affected have a copy of this and be asked to come and discuss it at the next meeting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:30| That would be excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| I'll make that part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| Second agrees to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Commissioner Wright, I say that again, what was just added to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| He's going to add to it that we're going to defer it for 30 days at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| and then he wants the department heads that are affected to come and speak to the policy at the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| And when we say department heads, we're also using interchangeably the word elected officials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7613)|
| 2:07:00| If the law department deems that the office will be affected, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| Well, with all due respect, commissioners, I think we would be helpful if we knew the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| If the intent was to encompass all elected officials countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| then it would merit a different review than if it was just restricted to say the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| and or the executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| If this is a countywide policy, then obviously the review would merit a different slant, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:34| But everyone who has charge of people who drive these vehicles needs to be here and have a voice in this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:44| Now, some of those are not elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| but if they have supervision of people who are taking these vehicles home, they should have a dog in this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:53| Well, clearly, Commissioner, you'll look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| We wouldn't look at this in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| In other words, I know attorneys are trained to not look beyond the four corners of a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| and look at it purely for legal effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| But we'd also look at it for public management and, likewise, public administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| and risk management implications, but we would defer to the board in those instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| But what individuals the board wants at the table, so to speak, is the board's decision, clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:20| I would like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| Do I still have the floor, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| I would like to ask that the law department see if it's within charter and within state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| if it can apply to elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| or if it just applies to the administrative and commission-controlled departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| That would be my resolution or my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| You agree to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| The question was asked of intent, so as I'm the one who wrote it, let me ask answers to intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| Please note that this is more of an overlay than a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| This is asked to be incorporated into our existing vehicle policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| So, presumably, to whomever our existing vehicle policy applies, the overlay would apply as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:09| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| It would be my intent that this would cover all Knox County vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| whether it's through an elected official or an appointed department head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| and I would ask the law director to clarify that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| Most of what we have here are things that I think everyone would agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| For example, no one will operate a county vehicle under the influence of alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| no smoking in the county vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| If you get a parking ticket, you're responsible for paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| You have to report if you need moving violations, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| The most controversial aspect of this, obviously, is going to be the take-home portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| and who gets a take-home vehicle and who doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| or what is the criteria used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| I would suggest to Mr. Law Director that if, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| you find that we do have offices that do not come under the purview of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7793)|
| 2:09:58| that you write a letter and ask them to provide you with their written policy of what their guidelines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| with regards to take-home vehicles so that we might have that at our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| as part of any discussions that we might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Mr. Chairman, members of the board will certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| My understanding is that the existing policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| although widely disseminated throughout the county, was never formally adopted by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| So I think ultimately you're going to have to adopt a singular policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| or if you want to use this to augment that which is already out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| But that underlying policy was never really given a formal blessing by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| Yes, I guess I'm now back to my original question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| Did you say a moment ago that you had reviewed existing policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| as in referring to elected officials' policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| I've looked at the policies that have been vetted by members of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| and I've looked at the preexisting policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| But, again, I looked at it from the terms of the intent of the original one was it appeared to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:05| merely towards the county executive and his departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| And now it appears the board wants me to look at this from the standpoint of a full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| broad-based policy that encompasses all entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| And that's going to obviously take a different type of review because what you can foist upon the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:27| and the commission is different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| Perhaps you can foist upon other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| That remains to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| But if there's an infirmity, I'll certainly at least provide you what I think the legal ramifications are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| and likewise ask those entities that have a distinct policy to provide it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| If there are organizations in Knox County that are funded through action of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:54| I believe it would be perfectly proper and appropriate that we ask those people who have automobiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7914)|
| 2:12:01| if they could tell us what their policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| I don't think I'm willing to approve it or disapprove of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| I think that we should know what that policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| I believe that's what we've been drilling for for the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| Yeah, I believe you're clearly entitled to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| Again, this comes out of the same pot of money, the public coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| We need accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| The more vehicles you have on the street, the greater risk and insurance implications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| the greater point for liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| The state of Tennessee is pretty much abrogated sovereign immunity when it comes to vehicle accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| which means we're on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| And that could deplete our self-insured retentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| So clearly, in order to make an informed decision, you need every policy that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| If there is no policy, you need to offer a policy, I believe, respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| And then if an entity refuses that policy, you need to know, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| what are they going to do about it in the interim and what's their refusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| Then there's a distinction between refusing it because they merely don't like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| or having a legal basis in which to refuse it or reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Commissioner Harmon, we just got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| What do you estimate that this will save in vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| Do you have a number that you're coming up with that this would cut back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| Well, assume for a second that we end up cutting either through this mechanism or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:24| Fifty vehicles, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| My estimations on insurance, cost repair, resale value, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| somewhere between half a million and a million dollars taxpayer savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| Well, per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:40| Some of those are per year figures and some of them are one-time savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8035)|
| 2:14:02| Also, Mr. Chairman, just for clarity's sake, we have two here from myself and Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| I'd like to withdraw mine and just have one resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| so we don't have both of them popping up each month, whatever we need to do to do that, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| I was going to ask him if all of this was going to be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| We were having a discussion up here amongst ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| So you want to withdraw yours and that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| I can withdraw mine and just go with Mr. Harmon because, again, we don't need dueling things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| It's just all one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:30| And I support Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Well, that was 907 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| Well, I didn't intend it to be, but I suppose I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| Well, he's going to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| I anticipated mine as a substitute for 906 and to vote on 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8082)|
| 2:14:50| Well, Commissioner, I'll do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| If you're going to leave it on there, I'll leave it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| We can defer that one 30 days and vote on yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| If you want to do that, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| It's been deferred twice before, and I can live with it being deferred again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| There's an overlap, obviously, in some of the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| There's one distinct difference in that 907 requires removing take-home vehicles from persons currently assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:16| whereas 906 would not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| I believe 906 deferred 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| That's basically the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| Go ahead and take up 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| You said you wanted to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| I can live with that if someone wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| I'd prefer a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| I'll defer to the whims and wills of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| Let's do 907 and see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| 907 is a resolution approving steps to be taken to reduce vehicle costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| and to improve vehicle efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| Finance, 8-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| 7-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| You want to make a motion, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| I would like to clarify, by the way, that when it says budget, it should refer us to 2009-2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:09| And when it says number of taxpayer, it means number of currently assigned taxpayer vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:17| Do we have a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| I think there might be some people in the audience that want to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| JJ, you look like you may want to say something or anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:35| Just briefly, what I said I would do, I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| I cut the budget from 28 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| You can vote on this whether you want to one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| but we're not going to deal with any more issues on the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| So we're done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| I guess I just, you know, I like to look at this whole thing at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| We're going to be talking about this again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| And I know Commissioner Harmon would like to have this voted on this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| But I kind of like to take a look at it, everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| So I'd like to introduce a substitute motion to postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| so that we can look at both of these next month and dispose of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| To defer for 30 days, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| I'm not done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| I didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| It's not going to affect the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| But I would prefer that we get down to just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| I was actually going to make a substitute motion to ask you to withdraw this so that we can just have one policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| come before us so that we don't have this confusion as to what just happened, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8277)|
| 2:18:04| between who's going to sponsor the policy, who's not, what are the differences between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8284)|
| 2:18:11| I would prefer just to get down to just, you know, having one policy brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:18| And then if we wish to amend that one policy, then amend it through the process instead of having these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:25| sort of hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| And I think that's part of the problem with what's been happening and why we keep deferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| is because we keep having these two out there instead of just having one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| Commissioner Luto, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| And if you want to, when we take this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| we can make a motion to amend or to consider one as an amendment to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| That's all I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:53| Page 15, 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| Was there a vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| The motion was, yeah, passed to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| 18 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| Page 15, 910 is expressing the Knox County Commission's support of U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| Senator Lamar Alexander's proposal to build 100 nuclear power plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| No recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| I know several of us are asking the question, why this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| Why are we talking about things going on in Washington, D.C.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| I guess more importantly, is this a local issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| I think it's the crux of the matter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| You know, although I really like Mr. Charlton Hester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| Charlton Heston, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| Mr. Heston and, you know, been here at Ten Commandments bowling for Columbine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| He really doesn't have any ties to Knox County, the state or the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8400)|
| 2:20:09| But let's go into my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| Let's ask the fundamental question, which my resolution puts before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| Nuclear power, is this a local issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| I emphatically say that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| The Tennessee Valley has enjoyed nuclear power and its many advantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| and has thrived as a result of nuclear power coming to East Tennessee in the early 40s with the Manhattan Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| And we've been at the forefront of that industry, technology, since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| So, you know, I know people have strong feelings as it relates to nuclear power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| But let's ask ourselves fundamental questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| We enjoy indoor plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| We enjoy having electricity to power our HVAC systems, our computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| all our little whatnots that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| So we are dependent on electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| Let's start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| Wind is a way to generate power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| In this region, there's not much of it available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| And if we do too much, I think we'll do some damage to our ridges and slope tops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| our mountain tops and our mountain ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| I think that would be pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| Solar is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| But if you cover this facility here with solar panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| you wouldn't have nearly enough electricity generated in this region to power the HVAC system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:44| So it's not viable at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| Gas, you can have gas-generated products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| But those are pretty expensive and really only used on the hottest of days just to keep up with the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:57| And that is a high cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| And it does put a lot of pollutants in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| Then we go to water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| The Tennessee Valley Authority has great natural resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| and TVA came in that similar time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| But they've pretty much dammed up all the rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| And we're limited at this point with how much electricity that's going to generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:22| You know, there was actually a story last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| With all this rain that we've gotten, we're still 30% down over, like, the last five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| So we're not able to generate that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| It's not reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| It's dependent on Mother Nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| And then we go to coal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| We just got through talking about air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| You're talking about something that really is harming this valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| It's our coal-fired plants, generation plants, bore run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:55| And then let's talk about Kingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| I mean, that region is devastated by one singular event, the coal ash spill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| And it's costing all of us millions of dollars because that pollution was just piled up in wet storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| and the levee broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| So East Tennessee should be proud of its role in nuclear technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| Again, Oak Ridge was founded on nuclear technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| It's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| It's reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| You know, when you talk about, well, you talk about Three Mountain Island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| I mean, a lot of us remember that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| I was a kid there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| That was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| Technology has improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| In fact, last week, there is a proposal on the table right now to build an inherently safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| it doesn't count on pumps and motors turning on, inherently safe power plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| at the old Clinch River Breeder Reactor site in Rome County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| Again, so if nuclear power is safe, it's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| So Senator Alexander's proposal embodies East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8636)|
| 2:24:03| So what will we stand to gain from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| It will be an economic boom for this area, boom for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| So we're talking about high quality, high skilled jobs, scientists, engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| We're also talking about pipe fitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| We're talking about welders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| We're talking about electricians, carpenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| We're talking about a lot of good crosscut of opportunities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| So is this a local issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| This is vitally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:34| We're talking about dependence on foreign oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| If we built these hundred power plants, I mean, you know, I don't have the percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| but it would vastly cut down on our dependence on foreign entities for having a stable power grid here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:54| in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| So that's why I put this resolution on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| That's why I encourage you all to pass it on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| I share some of Commissioner McKenzie's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| especially the ones about dirty coal-fired power plants wherever they are upwind of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8713)|
| 2:25:18| That's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| The University of Tennessee has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| A whole bunch of places have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| We need to get off these coal-fired plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| But what's the right mechanism to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| It's a good national debate that's going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| I can see Commissioner McKenzie as an expert witness methodically arguing his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:42| My case starts in my dorm room when I was called and asked to prepare my dorm as a potential evacuation site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:50| for people from near Three Mile Island, and I remember Chernobyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| And I still haven't heard a good answer to the twin questions of potential dirty bombs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| with nuclear leftover material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| and the waste material that's being trucked to Chukalaka Mountain sometimes, sometimes not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:10| And I think that this debate, although we have a modest local connection to it, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:16| a lot of places have connections to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| And it is really a national issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| I will agree with my distinguished colleagues in some points and disagree in others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| but I wonder just why the debate is taking place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| It's something that our national congressmen and senators will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| We can contribute to the debate today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| I will make my notations about those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| and Commissioner McKenzie will make a good argument for his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| We'll all go back and read certain books like We Almost Lost Detroit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| and remember about our history of thinking we can devise infallible things and how that doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| But for me, I just don't think it's our function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| And there are pluses and minuses, but it's a national debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| And I will vote no because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| I actually believe that this is very much a local issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| I think that what goes on on the federal level affects us locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| And I myself have brought some things before this commission asking for support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| or against certain federal things that would affect the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8842)|
| 2:27:28| This will emphatically affect the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| I know a lot of times when we get on the national issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| you see myself and Commissioner McKenzie debating opposite sides of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| Today, however, will not be one of those days because we are in absolute agreement on nuclear energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:46| I'm a single man, and being single and not having a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| I can afford to travel a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| And I've traveled around the world, and I've seen what other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| other countries have done with nuclear energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| France runs almost exclusively on nuclear energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| and I think that it is a shame that for so many years that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| the country that started nuclear energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| that we are lagging behind the world community when it comes to nuclear energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| I believe that we should support this, and that's why I'm going to vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| I think especially here locally, we are so close to Oak Ridge, where a lot of this technology is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:34| I think a lot of our friends and neighbors have worked within the nuclear energy industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8914)|
| 2:28:41| and I think that absolutely it's a local issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| and absolutely it is within the best interest of not only this nation but this community that this pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8924)|
| 2:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| Motion passes 18-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| We're going to 9-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Commissioner Harmon mentioned he wanted it moved up, so 9-19 is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:14| 9-19 is listed on Page 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| It's a resolution seeking requests for qualifications from qualified law firms to serve as legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8956)|
| 2:29:22| for the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| Finance, 9-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| Intergovernmental vote 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| Commissioner McKenzie, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:48| Oh, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| Is someone here from the Pension Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| Could we hear from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| Yeah, we've got Richard Readers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| I didn't know if Ms. Brooks wanted to say anything before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| Or the chairman of the Pension Board, Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| I'd like to hear from them with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| At this time, I'm going to ask Mr. Beeler, if he will, to sort of give our authority over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9004)|
| 2:30:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| Commissioners, Richard Beeler with the law firm of Robertson Overby, Wilson & Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:18| and 900 South Gay Street, Suite 703.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| I'm general counsel for the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| The Pension Board, after being informed that this resolution was being brought for your consideration today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:32| adopted a resolution respectfully submitting that it would be inappropriate for the board to undertake any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:42| procurement for the services that Mr. Mason and the firm of Kennerly Montgomery provide to the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:53| And I have, by the way, I'm confident I have enough extras here, Mr. Chairman, to distribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9053)|
| 2:31:03| It's the position of the Pension Board that Mr. Mason provides a very peculiar area of services to the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:15| That is his focus and entire concentration of his practice and has been for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| He retained the services of Bill a couple, three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9082)|
| 2:31:28| It was well before he was affiliated with the firm of Kennerly Montgomery & Finley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| In fact, he did not join the firm until after the law director had left the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:41| These matters came up in the firm in March, late March, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| And we believe that this would be a really terrible signal to send to people who might bring some type of acts of dishonesty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:58| or misrepresentation or misconduct to the attention of a public body the way Mr. Mason and Kennerly Montgomery did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:07| In fact, in the 30 days since the last Pension Board meeting when Mr. Lockett made his presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:14| you know, on behalf of the Pension Board, since it was brought to our attention first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| and I'm not sure why it wasn't brought to the Commission's attention at the same time either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| but it was brought to our attention first at the instance of Kennerly Montgomery & Finley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9143)|
| 2:32:31| They had advised Mr. Lockett that if he did not make a disclosure that the law firm was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| and had prepared a correspondence to bring this to the attention of the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| Since then, in talking with a couple of the principals in the firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9162)|
| 2:32:50| I have learned that everything that I have learned leads me to the very firm conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9170)|
| 2:32:59| that there is absolutely nothing that Kennerly Montgomery did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| or failed to do throughout this process that would suggest in any way any act of impropriety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9184)|
| 2:33:13| or dishonesty or malfeasance on the part of Mr. Mason or the law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9193)|
| 2:33:20| In fact, just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| Everything that I have found leads me to the absolute conviction that they have acted in the highest standards of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:32| profession, that they have reported it promptly, insisted that it be taken care of the way it's supposed to be taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| and brought to the attention of the client to avoid even any appearance of impropriety on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:46| This is one of those cases where very easily it could have never come to anyone's attention in the public arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9226)|
| 2:33:54| but because of their loyalty and their dedication and commitment to the attorney-client relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9234)|
| 2:34:01| with the pension system, they required that a disclosure be made to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9241)|
| 2:34:08| So I would like to, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| distribute copies of the resolution adopted by the board this morning, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| and I'll be glad to try to address any questions anyone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:31| Richard, you can just give them and we can pass them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9271)|
| 2:34:38| It seems as though we have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9278)|
| 2:34:48| Commissioner Browse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| This isn't so much a question as it is a statement that this in no way indicates that I'm suggesting that the pension board fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:59| Bill Mason or Kennerly-Montgomery and Finley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| which is that there are some questions that I've heard from constituents that need to be asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| and answered, I believe, as a matter of public record, and this would allow a way for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:16| That's simply why this was brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| I understand that Bill Mason is fabulous at what he does, and we're lucky to have him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9318)|
