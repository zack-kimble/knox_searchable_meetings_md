| 0:10:14| I only have a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| There's not much I can add to my resume or add to the comments that I made the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| I understand on this commission there's some concern about the fact that I have a pending lawsuit against two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| But with that in mind, I'd like to make a very brief comment about inclusion, transparency, and engagement of the public in the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=630)|
| 0:10:42| From my perspective, I feel like that all I've done in pursuit of my rights as a citizen of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=642)|
| 0:10:52| is to try to have an engagement with the county government and to address issues that I might find inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=652)|
| 0:11:02| And I would hope that this county commission and the coming county commission will embrace the taxpayers and the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| and encourage them to engage in the public process and follow their wishes and their needs and their hopes and dreams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=671)|
| 0:11:20| of taking this county to a better place than it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| And with that said, I thank you for your day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=684)|
| 0:11:38| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| My name is Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| I live at 1137 West Scott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| And I am proud to be able to say that I was nominated for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| And I consider it an honor and a privilege to serve the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=708)|
| 0:11:58| And I hope that you really seriously consider me for the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| I cannot add nothing else to my resume or to the works that I've tried to do in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| or the people I met while I was campaigning for this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| And if there's a problem about me substitute teaching, I will drop the substitute teaching if I'm sitting on that bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you and vote your hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=739)|
| 0:12:28| The other person nominated, would you like to come and speak to this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| Hello, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| My name is Mark Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I live at 1309 Adair Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| I want to thank you all for the opportunity and the nomination here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| I can't add much else other than I'm ready to serve and look forward to representing the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you, Mr. Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| I need a motion to close the nomination on the three names given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I'll make a motion to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Is there anyone else from the audience that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Any commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Would they like to have anything else to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| The 2nd District is near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| This is a very, very difficult decision for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Any one of the four gentlemen who came forward, any one of the three nominations, again, would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| I don't think the matter of lawsuit should play in anyone's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| I think items of character are proper considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| I think items of experience are proper considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| I think items of stances on important public issues are proper considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| So in that saying, vote your conscience and do what you believe to be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I agree with Commissioner Harmon again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| I think we had four really good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| It was one of the tougher choices I had was to try to select out of these four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| and I'll be proud to serve with any of the three that were nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| But I just felt like I really liked Chuck Williams' passion, so that's why I nominated him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| I just want to say to my fellow commissioners, in no way let your vote be going a different way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| other than for don't let the lawsuit stand in your way of voting for Mr. Wufenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| Mr. Wufenbarger has an outstanding resume, as the other four do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| and he represents his community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| So if that's the only reason you choose to vote against him because of the lawsuit, I ask you not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=889)|
| 0:15:00| Is there any other commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Clerk, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=905)|

| 0:15:52| Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=957)|
| 0:16:09| Five, three, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Mr. Chairman, we're at five, three, three, are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| The vote is five, three, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| We don't have a low vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| I assume the five was for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Five for Campin, three for Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Now that the vote is announced, can we change vote or will we have to vote again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| What we will do, we will vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Clerk, if you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| For all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Let's not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1011)|

| 0:17:21| Wufenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Wufenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| For all three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| The vote is Campin, four, Williams, three, and Wufenbarger, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| So Mr. Williams will drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| We will start the vote again for Campin or Wufenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1066)|
| 0:17:58| Any commissioner have any other comments they would like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| I would just say that a lot of the sentiment in my district split right down those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| Campin or Wufenbarger, with some nice sentiment toward Williams as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| So you're mirroring the district very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| I was going to say it was a very, very close choice with me between Campin and Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1097)|
| 0:18:26| I guess since that Williams has dropped off, Campin was so close to him and his passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| So I think I'll probably be supporting Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Is there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Seeing none, clerk, would you call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1118)|

| 0:18:53| Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Y'all get a little excitement in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1138)|

| 0:21:28| Well, this is a hard choice for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| I know every one of these people real well, but I'm going to have to go along with DeFries because of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1291)|
| 0:21:42| Are there any nominations from the floor, from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1302)|
| 0:21:52| Seeing none, would Mr. DeFries or Mr. Pleasant, would they like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1312)|
| 0:22:12| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you for your nomination and your faith in myself as serving on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| And my name is Victoria DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| I live at 2921 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| I am very easy to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| I'm very resourceful and very diligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| And I look forward to having an opportunity, should you grant me this, to serve on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Are there any questions for Mr. DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Thank you, Mr. DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Mr. Pleasant would like to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| Gordon Pleasant, 4737 Reed Lane, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| I want to thank you very much, Tony, for nominating me, allowing me a chance to address this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| I also want to say that I think Victoria is an excellent choice, and I applaud you all for nominating her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| And I want to follow up on something that we spoke with a little bit about transferable development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| and clear something up a little bit about what that subject matter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| And that allows the people who own the property to decide the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| So I want to make sure that that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| And I look forward to working with this body no matter the result of the vote today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| and also working with Victoria, and we've had a conversation a little bit about land use and zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1413)|
| 0:23:42| So I'd further like to say that I look forward to expressing democracy today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| and I appreciate this body's openness and how people have expressed their intentions throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| So it's been very open, and I hope that the public takes note of that because I feel that it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| And I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| I just wanted to make a comment in reference to the nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| and that was that if I'd been able to get here earlier and the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| and the situation in the parking lot hadn't been so packed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| I would have been here in time to probably ease over towards Mr. Freese and say congratulations, Mr. Freese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| I'm pretty convinced that you'll probably win this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| And then I would have probably already said something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| but I do not want Martin Pleasant to get shut out of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| I think that would be an embarrassment to us because he is such a gifted person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| and a value to this community and to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| and therefore I want to make sure he's in the mix, and that's what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you, Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| I just want to say that not only am I glad that Martin Pleasant was nominated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| he adds greatly to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| So do some of the other people who are not nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Chuck Ward does a great deal for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| And I hope all of us remember some of the names in these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| When boards and commission appointees come up before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| I think some of them would be excellent public servants in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| I need a motion to close the nominations on the two given names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1531)|

| 0:28:32| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| We have four people that have been nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| Is there anyone from the audience that would like to nominate someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1726)|
| 0:28:56| You have to come to the podium after Mr. Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| No, Mr. Golden, you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| I would like to place myself in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Your name and foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Jimmy Golden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| James Rawlinson Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| You can call me Jimmy Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| My name is Albert Baugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| I live at 1536 Cliffside Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| I nominate Pete True for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Pete True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Did you withdraw or you're not going to do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Is there anything you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| I have a problem with this nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| I was the Republican candidate for this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| I won 100% of my primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| And I feel that it's wrong to nominate someone who is running against someone else in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1791)|
| 0:30:01| And I also feel that some of the commissioners should exempt themselves from nominating candidates that they campaigned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| I think it's ethically wrong and morally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| If you do those two things, then you don't have to worry about the legal aspects of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| And I think it's completely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| That's why I'm not seeking the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| I think it's totally wrong for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| And as a citizen of this county, and a citizen of this state, and a citizen of this country, I'm not going to sit back and keep quiet about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1827)|
| 0:30:39| Because I'm going to voice my views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| And I think it's completely wrong for Sam McKenzie to be the nominee for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| That's what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And I also feel that some of you should exempt yourself from this nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| We have six candidates for the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Mr. McKenzie, Ms. Cox, Mr. Boyd, Mr. Barr, Mr. Golden, and Mr. Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1864)|
| 0:31:15| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Albert, did I hear you right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Did you withdraw your name from nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| I don't want the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| I just want what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I just wanted to make clear because the Chairman did put you down as being nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Should I take him off then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| He's already off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| He's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| I believe we need a motion that nominations be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I need to get nominations from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| First, I need to ask any candidate if they would like to come and address this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1913)|
| 0:32:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Jim Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| I would like to address the body one more time, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| Give your address one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| My name is James Rawlinson Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I live at 4139 Skyline Drive in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| in a home that is frequently vandalized by gangs in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| In January of 2007, I entered my name for District 1 Commissioner for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| but our commissioners refused to give me a few minutes to state my qualifications for the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| so now we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| I am a graduate of East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| I served as a nuclear missile technician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| and strategic air commander of the United States Air Force during Vietnam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| where I also attended the University of Wyoming and later the University of Tennessee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| I served in the engineering department of American Telephone and Telegraph Company across America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| and later retired from South Centralville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| I operate a small company called Golden Research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| where I back up corporations in development of new methods and technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| mostly where others have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| I don't have a degree from a university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| but I have had occasion to teach professors at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| as well as research scientists and engineers at Oak Ridge National Laboratories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| because of my success where they have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| I helped build Bull Run Steam Plant, the most efficient generating plant in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| Oak Ridge is a pet project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| But I hold a patent on a combustion technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| that is more efficient and cleaner than Bull Run Steam Plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| yet has not received any media attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| I was a volunteer with Mobile Meals for some 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| and am a volunteer teacher in the Merrillville School System at Fort Craig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| one of the top schools in our nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| now threatened with being closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| where my daughter is a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| I am a private pilot with an instrument rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| and a volunteer with the Young Eagles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| teaching youth about aviation and volunteering rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| And through aviation, I volunteer with remote area medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| I am a ham radio operator and a volunteer with emergency services in several counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| and I am a mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Why do I want to be a county commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Because I'm tired of finding schoolchildren hiding in my yard when I come home from school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| after being attacked by gangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I'm tired of finding the elderly abused and abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| and having our community turn in a deaf ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| I'm tired of being threatened by codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| to stop helping the elderly in the community by threatening to tear my house down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| and it probably should be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| It's a wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| I'm tired of finding drug enforcement agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| goading kids into selling drugs so they can arrest them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| and then finding these people running for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| I'm tired of listening to cars drive through our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| with noise-generating systems that shake our homes until burglar alarms are set off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| I'm tired of seeing Knox County blighted with subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| and other county residents in other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| being forced to pay for the infrastructure from these subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| I'm tired of having Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| tell me to take learning systems away from students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| because their higher knowledge is becoming disruptive in class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| and I'm against large schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| I've been in large schools like Holston, which was a mess when I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| and I graduated from East High School that had 400 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| and kids from other schools came to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Mr. Holston, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Yes, sir. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| Large schools just allow kids to fall through the cracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| and we need to get past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I'm tired of seeing areas of Knoxville that do not receive city services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| being forced to pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I fought the Knox County Waste Incinerator Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| because commissioners attempted to shove outdated technology down our throats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and when the county commission made a plea for agencies that needed help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| and wanted to levy a wheel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| I found that I was a volunteer with most of these agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| and knew of their corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| But when I vocalized this during a county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| the police were called to physically remove me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| and the cameras at county commission were turned off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| so no one could see this trickery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| You need to wrap it up, Mr. Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I will wrap it up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| And now our community leaders have placed a large water tank as an eyesore to our skyline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2200)|
| 0:36:50| instead of placing it on a hill where they are in all other areas of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| These things are just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| And I want to thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| I had a little more, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I don't expect to be elected, and frankly, I don't want the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| I'll have to give up a lot if I have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| But I hope you'll elect someone that will work hard at this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| and help us make a better community than we have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Thank you, Mr. Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Is there any other person that has been nominated who would like to speak to this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2241)|
| 0:37:31| Mr. Pete Drew, 917 South Andy Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| All my adult life I fought against corrupt processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| It's not about whether somebody is entitled to have a position or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| It's not about exchanging one person for another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| It's about protecting the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| I came up through the civil rights struggle, and that's the only thing that I knew would protect your right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| and that is that the process was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| And what is taking place here is not fair and it's not just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| Respect you have to earn, but justice you're entitled to just because you're an American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| Can I take a person who is going to be on the ballot in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| when you've got two candidates running for that same office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| and then give one the advantage by making them an incumbent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| That is not only unjust, it's unfair, and it's unacceptable for grown people who understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2314)|
| 0:38:45| It's not like you don't understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| I know you understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| And so I've got a kind of heavy heart this morning because I see all the things that I've fought for since the early 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2330)|
| 0:39:01| and I see them slipping away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| And we have in this government, in this town, in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| a conspiracy of low expectations for specific areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| And when you come together and you don't expect from a certain area of town the same thing that you expect from another area of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| that's where injustice takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| And what has happened here, and I heard the nominations, and I'm not a sore loser, I lost fair and square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| Mr. McKenzie beat me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| He won the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| But you must keep in mind, he did not win a majority of the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| If he'd got 50% of the votes plus one, I wouldn't be before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| But more people was opposed to McKenzie than was for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| He got 42.7% of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| And that's what makes it unjust, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Do not leave here today feeling good about something you did because I don't want you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| I don't want you to have that experience because the process is not correct as you're using it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| And I will do with everything that is within me to try to correct the process, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| Thank you for allowing me to appear before you, and I hope you search in your heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| and then do that which is right and just because you're the only one who has to look in the mirror when you get up in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| Mr. Drew, we have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| Pete, I've got the election results here, and I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| I understand that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I'm looking at Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| He got 1671, and that's 42%, 42.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| So he almost got 50%, but the next closest person, which was you, only got 22%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| So, I mean, there is a wide gap in the difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| It has nothing to do, Mr. Smith, with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| The process says you need 50% of the vote plus one to be elected in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| I don't know about other places, but in this county, you're supposed to have 50% of the vote plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Now, what we're doing here is we're justifying an unjust position that you're taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| and this is how this whole commission got in trouble in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| It wasn't that you didn't have the right to build coalitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| That's the only thing that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| I understand that politics makes strange bedfellows, and so you come from one position with some guy who was really opposing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| On the very next bill, you may have to work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| That's where the strange bedfellows come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| But this is not a correct process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| And when you say that 42% of the vote is okay, then it says something about the mentality of the people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| It is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| I'm not saying it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I'm saying he got 42%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| The next closest person got 21%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I, myself, was in a five-person race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| I got 48%, 46% of the vote in my race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| I understand what Mr. McKenzie is going through completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| I understand what you're going through completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| You need to understand what my community is going through, Mr. Smith, because we suffer from a conspiracy of low expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| When somebody says East Knoxville, the first thing that comes to your mind is who's walking down Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| and who's doing drugs and who's doing this, and that picture in your mind has got to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| And the only way it changes is when you move from low expectations to high expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| When somebody graduates from East High School, Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| you get the same picture in your mind as you do when somebody graduates from Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| That's what's got to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| And that's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Mr. Smith, to stay on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Do you have any other questions concerning this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| That's when I see Mr. McKenzie, I see him a step above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| I meant Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Yeah, I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I know Mr. Drew personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| I know Albert Ball personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| You all are both fine folks that I think would be well qualified to serve on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| and I really appreciate you all's willingness to step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| I made a commitment early on that since we were waiting until after the primaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| that when there was a really heavy vote getter in the primary, that I was going to support the heavy vote getter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| I would use that data of the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| I actually don't know Mr. McKenzie except from the times that he's addressed this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| And I know you and Mr. Ball personally, and you all are both well qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| but I'm going to have to stick with using the data that we got from the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| And it's flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| We're human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| We're imperfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| It's a flawed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I really wish we could have an election, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| we're doing the very best we can with the situation we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| And I do appreciate your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Can I respond to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| I think it was a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Was that a question to Mr. Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| That was a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| That was a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Accepted as a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I wanted to ask our law director about the 50 plus 1 in the county elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| I don't think that works that way, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Based on the vote, it's the highest vote getter that gets the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| If you've got a Republican and a Democrat, they still go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| They go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| The highest vote getter for each party goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you, Mr. Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| The highest vote getter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Mr. McKenzie is going to be the nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| He is the nominee, based on what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| From the Democrat party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| From the Democratic party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| That's the abuse of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Is there any other candidate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| My name is Robert Boyd, and I live at 3627 Riverview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| And I really want to thank, I think it was Mr. Harmon, whomever nominated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| And it gives me a chance to come before you again and call your attention to something I neglected the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| And that's my community activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| I left that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I did, of course, discuss it with my education and my profession at some length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| Plus the fact that I'm still proud to be an Allegan from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| I have owned that property at 3627 Riverview Drive since 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| I've been a taxpayer here since 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Now, someone asked me the other day a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| What was the one thing that was going on in District 1 that, well, that didn't say District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| That one point, one thing that bothered me most about what's going on in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| And I said, perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| The perception in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| The perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I couldn't have said it better than these two previous speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| That's why I offered my name forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| I brought my name forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I do not have a political base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| No, I don't have a political base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| I have not been involved in politics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| However, if you look at my resume, I have been involved in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| When I was in New York, of course, in Long Island, I was the head of the Democratic Party in my village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| And I was what you call, I think you call it a district leader here, but I was a zone leader there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| So I've been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| I've sat on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| I was appointed, but I didn't run for the position because I didn't want that conflict to run for the position that I was sitting in as an incumbent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2807)|
| 0:46:58| I see that coming on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| And I think I'm asking all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| I know you don't live in District 1 with the exception of one member here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| But it is, as Mr. Drew said, you know, it seems as though it's always District 1 that has this tarnished kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2827)|
| 0:47:18| My resume will eliminate that for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Six months you won't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Let them go out and fight it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Let the people put them on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| When I was here the other day, we were talking about city clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| The person withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I said, that's admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| That's admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| And I guarantee you that person who withdrew his name from asking you for the appointment will be elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| And there's no doubt in my mind that Mr. McKenzie will be elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| There's no doubt he has the political base, the strongest political base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| And yes, he's got the most votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| But for six months, for six months, put somebody on that board where there's no controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| And I'm offering my resume, and it's strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| It's strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| And as I said before, I am well-known and well-respected in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| I really am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Now, I'm not a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| I haven't been involved in politics because I gave that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| My wife says, get away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Stay away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| That's why I didn't run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| That's why I didn't run for position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And that's why I didn't initially submit my name for appointment until I heard about Mr. Boyd and this controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| I said, let me put my name in there because it's neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| I have no axe to grind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| You have one minute, Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| So what I want to do is give you an opportunity again, and I really, I think it was Mr. Harmon that placed my name in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| I really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I don't know how much that meant to me because it gives me a chance for you to ask me some more questions about my resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| and about my activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Are there any questions for Mr. Boyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Mr. Lampert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Just a comment, Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| I've only just gotten to know you through this process, and I look forward to getting to know you better in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| And I hope that you'll seek other appointments to other boards and things because I do believe that you're a community leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Mr. Boyd, I'm really impressed with your enthusiasm and what you want to do in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| And, you know, you make it hard to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| I like what you've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| You speak from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| You speak from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| And I like your passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| I mean, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| That's the first time anybody's ever confused me with Lumpy, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| I don't take offense, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Mr. Boyd, you and I have something in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| My wife has also said to me, why don't you get out of this mess, so I can understand where she's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| I, too, am impressed with your credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| And when I heard you speak the other day, I was thinking to myself, wow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| the caliber of people who have come forward for this nomination are quite impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| I was impressed with you, what you had to say to us, your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| I've known Pete Drew a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I'm familiar with his community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| And in looking at the candidates here, they're good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| But in looking at how I would vote, I looked at the vote total, but that was only one factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| The other factors were resumes, background, involvement in the community, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| And so, again, these decisions are not easy decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| And I hope that you will continue, if you don't get the nomination, that you will continue to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| because we need people like you involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| But my choice of Mr. McKenzie were based on a number of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Mr. Boyd, they're talking about you, but I nominated you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| I'm Norman, Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| I'm proud that you came forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| You have a very impressive, obviously, just like these guys said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| I really appreciate your nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I'm sorry about the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| I wasn't going to let you thank the wrong guy, but I like you, too, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| I nominated Thera Cox, and apparently Thera is not choosing to speak, but I just wanted to publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| but maybe later, but I wanted to publicly thank her for all of her party and community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And that was one way of doing this was to nominate her and just recognize the good work she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Thank you, Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Any other person that's been nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| Sam McKenzie, 5211 Pinnacle Drive, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| A lot has been said today, and I hope that you all and the listening audience really hears what is being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3107)|
| 0:51:55| We talk about political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| The way I got this, quote, unquote, political power is by working, is by volunteering, is by doing things for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3118)|
| 0:52:06| And in that process, I get to know folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| You know, we have taken a, quote, made-up quote from one of the local papers and made it into a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Do I have friends who are elected officials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| But the way I got to know them is by working in youth organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| working to bring facilities to all of the First District, not just East Knoxville, working to raise money for Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| And in that process, they see a hardworking person, and they ask me to serve on boards because I have a heart for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| So I take great offense at anyone who insinuates that this is a somehow an underhanded deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3159)|
| 0:52:48| Look at my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Compare me person to person to the people that I ran against in the primary and the people in this nomination process, and then vote your hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3169)|
| 0:52:59| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| We have had a historic occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| We have a more people voted in this last primary election than has ever voted, you know, in recent times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3183)|
| 0:53:12| And it's just, it's disheartening to come out with a victory, as you said, Commissioner Smith, with an overwhelming victory, almost two to one to the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3192)|
| 0:53:22| Way, you know, if you look at the other party, you know, Mr. Bob didn't receive the little over 50%, maybe 60% of that party's votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3202)|
| 0:53:33| And he was the only candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| I expect to win in August, but I'm going to run against Mr. Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| It's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| He's a Republican nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| I'm the Democratic nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I'm ready to get this process started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| When I began this journey, I, like you, Commissioner Hammond, my wife asked me, did I really want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3226)|
| 0:53:54| I don't want to say she tried to talk me out of it, but she questioned me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| But this is a commitment that I have to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| This whole process is a commitment that I prayed about, and I'm ready to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| I guess I just want to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| It goes back to what Mr. Lambert was saying, talking about, you know, the formula that we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| and Commissioner Hammond the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| You know, just for the audience and the people at home, Sam, you know what you're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| You know you're going to be under the microscope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| So, you know, what you do over the next six to eight months and the votes that you take will be used for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| and against you in your campaign, and you're willing to step to the plate, evidently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| and take it rather than sit back and do the election process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| So I just want to let the people out there know that he's going to be accountable for, you know, his votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| and what he does during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| If you want to hit the ground running with it early, then, you know, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Mr. McKenzie, I just wanted to say I haven't met you until this process began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| but I really look forward to getting to know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Are there any other questions for Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| Seeing none, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| My name is Thera Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| I live at 3741 Catawba Avenue, and I want to thank you, Mr. Harmon, for nominating me for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| I feel that this is a very important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| I decided to run in the race to begin with because I wanted to be the speaker for the little people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| My community has very many problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Of course, perception is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I wanted the people to know that someone can come forth to represent them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| that will speak of their issues, that will be of concern, that will hear them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| that will represent them in all fashions of the community and for all of the district, not just East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| I wanted to seek this appointment because I felt that someone needed to come forth that was non-biased to the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3364)|
| 0:56:14| and can be accountable to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| I also did not turn in a resume for my employment because I felt that where I worked prior to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3377)|
| 0:56:26| had little or no significance to what I could represent as far as the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| But I did want you to know that I have a very broad background in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| I do understand the financial budget for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| I have studied it for many months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| And I also have a broad background as far as education is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Some of my experience in education is I was trained at Y-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| I took drafting in which I went from there and I worked overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| I could not until I checked it out tell you that part of the work that I did for overseas was with the Star Wars program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3421)|
| 0:57:10| But I found out recently that it is okay for me to speak of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| And therefore, I want to tell you that I do have a broad educational background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| and many, many years of experience since I retired from TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| Again, I want to thank you and to tell you that whoever you choose for this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| please remember that I am not finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| I have also been engaged in conversation with the other members that were on the ballot for the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| and we do plan to continue to work for the district and for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| You will be seeing us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| We have several things that we plan to bring forth to you regardless of who gets the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| and what happens from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you, Ms. Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Are there any questions for Ms. Cox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3479)|
| 0:58:07| Seeing none, I need a nomination to close the nomination on the five given names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Is it proper for me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| You've had your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| I'll allow personal privilege for Mr. Ball to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Mr. Ball, I'm going to give you two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| I appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| What I had to say was that I ran as a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| This election, most people here probably know how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| The fact that you got 49% of the Democratic vote has nothing to do with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| I got 100% of the Republican vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| I need to bring these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I have served in this community, worked in this community, never taken a dime from this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| I don't know what Mr. McKenzie is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| I've done my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| I want you all to look at the broad aspect of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| I've worked all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I don't owe the county a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| I've paid taxes in this community for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| I'm a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| I'm proud to be a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| It doesn't face me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| It's not about being a Republican or a Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| It's the person who do the job right for the people and honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| I have never used the system to my benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| I have never taken grants to build any houses for my benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| If anything that I've done, I've done to help this community, my neighbors, to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| If you help one person at a time, it's much better than having all that resume trying to impress people that you've done this and got to show me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3588)|
| 0:59:58| It's about life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| It's about what we can do to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| I've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I did get 100% of the Republican vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| When you vote on party lines, my name didn't appear on the Democratic vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| I have a lot of Democrats who have voted for me, if they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| It doesn't mean anything if they win the majority of the Democratic vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| I won 100% of the Republican vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| This is what I want to let you all know because nobody is talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| He comes out here and says he won 49%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| It doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Use your conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Do what is ethically right, morally right, then you don't have to worry about legally being right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| Because it will take care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I appreciate you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I need a motion to close the nominations on the five given names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| Can I get a properly moved and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| We've already had to vote, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Properly moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=3669)|

| 1:13:08| speaks volumes about the people that are asking to seek to represent the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| I feel like with some of the issues we've got facing Knox County over the next seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| that my background in business as well as accounting could be useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| and I would be honored to serve with each and every one of you to help make Knoxville a much better place to live and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4406)|
| 1:13:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Are there any questions for Mr. Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| I just have a statement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| This was, I think, Mr. Chairman, one of the more difficult decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| I'd be proud to serve with any five of these candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| I chose Logan Brummett for his passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| I also felt like, you know, he's the youngest candidate out of all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| and I felt like maybe it would give a little diversity to this group to have someone of his generation to have a voice up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4448)|
| 1:14:17| and I'd like to see him up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4457)|
| 1:14:24| Any other commissioners have a statement or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| I appreciate the comments from Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| I'd like to point out that we have put on a younger generation person now in Mark Campin, who will do an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4471)|
| 1:14:40| It's going to be difficult here, but I looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| and I came to I think the same conclusion as Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| that two candidates slightly rose above the pack, and that's Elaine Davis and William Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| Mr. Daniels brings budgetary experience and business experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Elaine Davis also has handled budgets, and she has experience in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| and she's a mom with kids in schools, and those experiences would be good additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| So I hope in some form or fashion, in some order, that those two are the ones we've selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| but no slight is intended against the other three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| I thought that just if we want to go by, if we waited for elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| we should note that each of them did substantially well in the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| Each did in excess of 1,400 votes for Elaine Davis, in excess of 1,700 for Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| They did exceptionally well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Other higher vote getters are not seeking, so I hope we go that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| I think that some of the people, just like what the Commissioner was just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| these individuals that we're looking at coming out of these races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| I look for several of these people to run also in 2010 after they get up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| and I think enjoy it and do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| I think a lot of these would be viable candidates later on down the road that the community will see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| And I got those numbers wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| It was in excess of 1,700 for Ms. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| I don't want to slight anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Any votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| I ran for a seat in 2004 and have never run for anything before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| even though I've been in politics for a number of years by the nature of the work that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| And I have a lot of respect for people who put their name on the ballot and who get in the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| And all of these people have gotten in the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| And they have campaigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| They've raised money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| They've gone door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| And I just want you to know that I respect each of you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Yes, this is a difficult decision because we have a number of people that would serve well over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| And so I, like my colleagues have mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| in looking at the situation and trying to evaluate all of the criteria that I look for, I have two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| And so I plan to vote for one on this round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| And we do have another seat that will be up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| And so this will give me an opportunity to vote for the second person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I need a motion to close the nominations on the five given names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Property moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=4625)|

| 1:31:27| Commissioner Hammond. I was going to nominate Dr. Briggs. Mr. Chairman, I'd like the opportunity to make a statement after you've done the roll call of the nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| Commissioner Luthode. I too was going to nominate Dr. Briggs, but I'll pass since he's already been nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5495)|

| 1:31:58| Is there anyone from the audience that would like to nominate someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5518)|
| 1:32:08| Seeing none, any other candidates would you like to address this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| I am here today for one reason, to support the right of voters to participate in a fair election in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5534)|
| 1:32:23| Since no one owns a crystal ball, it is unknown if an appointment to this commission helps or hurts a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5543)|
| 1:32:32| The voters want to decide between the two candidates running in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| While I voted in the Republican primary, I want to see the election process complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| I want to learn more about Dr. Briggs. I want to learn more about Don Sprouls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| I haven't decided who I'm going to vote for in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| I'd like that opportunity to decide with an unbiased position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| It's time to put the democratic process above party politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| I stand before you willing to serve, not seeking fame or fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| Just the opposite is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| As an independent real estate agent, I will earn less money by devoting time to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| and probably lose friends making tough decisions over the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| But I am willing to do this for my community because I believe in the democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| Several members of this commission, past commission, and other community leaders have encouraged me to run in the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5603)|
| 1:33:31| They cited that we needed more business people and more women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| I stand before you representing both. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Are there any questions for Ms. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Good morning. My name is Richard Briggs, 2235 Breakwater Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| First of all, I respect very much what Pamela said, and I respect that opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| because I know there's those that have that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| And I respect the part that she said she would like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| I respect the part that she said she would like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| I respect the part that she said she would like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I respect the part that she said she would like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| I know there's those that have that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| And I respect the part that she said she would like to know more about the candidates as the election comes up in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| The way I would like to respond to that is that I think there's probably no way of knowing what a candidate is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| than how he will vote and what his decisions are as he sits on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| People can say they're going to do one thing and then they may do another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| Also, part of the democratic process is having accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| And what more accountability could I have than I have to listen to the voters when we make decisions on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| Also, I have to take into account that I have an election in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| and part of the democratic process is having accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| For that reason, I went ahead and put my name in for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| There's no question the easy thing to do would have been to decline the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| and not gone through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Part of leadership is stepping forward and saying I'm willing to accept that responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| and I'm willing to be accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| And for that reason and the reasons that there were so many voters that had confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| that I was the person they wanted for this position, I elected to ask for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| I don't have a question, rather a statement, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Representing the Fifth District, and since this appointment affects all of the people that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| I just wanted the voters and the citizens there to know that we had three qualified and respected candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5730)|
| 1:35:38| who came forward to be considered for this nomination at our forum at the Farragut Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| And frankly, I would feel comfortable in voting for any of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| But I support Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| He was the top vote getter in the Republican primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| When he appeared before us, his statement about county commission and the difficulties we faced individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| and collectively suggests that he would be able to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| Furthermore, his qualifications are impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| And I've heard some say that we should appoint a caretaker for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| And if Dr. Briggs had not come forward, I would totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| But Dr. Briggs, as you've heard, says he is willing to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| and to take the chance that this appointment might be viewed negatively for him politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| His opponent, another respected and qualified candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| has said giving Dr. Briggs this appointment might give him an unfair advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| However, I would point out that if he is appointed, every vote, every statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| every action will be subject to scrutiny and potential criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| So all things considered, I think he is the right choice for the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| And I'll be casting my vote for Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Dr. Briggs, I just wanted to say I really appreciate your service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| A lot of folks in your position would not choose military service through the National Guard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| And I appreciate your willingness to serve on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| I think that we are going to be greatly benefited by your presence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| I also wanted to let you know I talked to my mother yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| and she's doing very well, and the valve work you did is holding up nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| Dr. Briggs ran a very hard race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| He had, I believe there was five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| All five candidates were very qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| I would have been proud to have served with any of those that ran in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| Likewise, I'd be proud to serve with Mr. Sprouls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| But the people of the 5th District spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| When they had a choice between five good candidates, Dr. Briggs rose to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| And I think we ought to listen to what the voters of the 5th District said in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| And for that reason, I'm going to be supporting him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| and I'd be very proud to serve with Ms. Tracy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| I wish she had ran because I think she would have been a good candidate out there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| and I'd be proud to serve with her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| But today, I feel like the people of the 5th District have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| and that's who I'm going to have to support today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| And thank you, Dr. Briggs, for coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| When I look at your resume and your qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| I wonder why you're not running for U.S. Senate or President instead of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| It's just overwhelming in your qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| I expect that you will win this appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| and I will welcome you on to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| But as I've stated, I'm in favor of this caretaker role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| and I will stick with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| And, of course, I'll be supporting Ms. Tracy because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| I respect that opinion very much, and I don't want anyone to think that I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you, though, for your kind comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| Is there any other commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Anyone from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Seeing none, I'll need a motion to close the nomination on the two given nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| I'll be moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=5964)|

| 1:40:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| The vote is Briggs 9, Tracy 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| Congratulations, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6016)|
| 1:40:27| Hopefully, if this comes out right, it should be 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| If it's not, we've got some serious questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| District 4, seat A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| Mr. Chairman, we are minus one member here, and I think we should hold off until he returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| We said we'd just hold off just on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| I think we should hold off on nominations until they do return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| At the pleasure of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Let's wait on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| Who's got the donuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6063)|
| 1:41:11| Are we taking a recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| No, we're just standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| We'll play the Jeopardy song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6077)|
| 1:41:34| I had to circle the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| And then I was listening in the car, and I was waiting for a good time to run in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6100)|
| 1:41:52| Fellow commissioners, please don't talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| Mr. Norman just asked me about the game Saturday night at Memphis, so I just wanted everybody to know we weren't talking politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| I've got tickets right here. Who needs tickets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6123)|
| 1:42:14| Sir, you'll need to go back to the audience. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6134)|

| 1:42:49| Fellow commissioners, please take your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Can we have a roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6171)|

| 1:43:44| No, ma'am. Elaine Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6230)|

| 1:44:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6282)|
| 1:44:50| We got all four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6291)|
| 1:45:01| Well, one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Yes, he did. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| Is there anyone from the audience that would like to nominate someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| Say that confused me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Seeing none, the candidates, would you like to address this body again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6313)|
| 1:45:23| Seeing no one that would like to address this body, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| I think, Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to say that I support Ms. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| and the reason I support Ms. Davis is in looking at her resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| It's impressive with her community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| Also, she has been in the trenches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| She has run in elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| She has run twice and has gone door-to-door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| done the things that candidates need to do to be elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| I respect the other individuals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| They've done the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| They've been in the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| But also, Ms. Davis has been here on many occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| As I've looked at her in the audience, I've seen her here at several meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| and so I know that she's been actively engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| and so that, again, shows me the intense interest that she has in serving on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| So I appreciate the fact that she and the others have come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| and I will be voting for Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Mark Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Mark Hammond, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| And I appreciate the sentiments just expressed by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| There's been a marvelous spirit of bipartisanship here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| I'm nominated in my own district, so I'm with a mixed party voting history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| I personally have voted today already for more Republicans than I have in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6385)|
| 1:46:33| And I hope partisanship doesn't enter this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| because Elaine Davis, with her record of community service, is an exceptional nominee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| I would just notice that at one of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| she was already talking to constituents in the audience about the Tedford Road file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| She knew the status of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| She knew the financial cost of cleanup of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| She's already doing things in her community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| and the perspective that she brings and the support that she's evidenced, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| makes her heads above the other candidates, all of whom are good choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| Any other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6427)|
| 1:47:14| I need to have a motion to close the nomination on the four given names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6439)|

| 1:48:23| Congratulations, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6503)|
| 1:48:33| I would like to say to the eight new commissioners at 2 o'clock, on Friday we will have a new commissioner workshop orientation, 830,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6513)|
| 1:48:46| sponsored by the sheriff's office in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| It should last roughly two to two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| There will be a lot of material and a lot of information given at that particular workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6533)|
| 1:49:02| Moving on to the four county wives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| Ms. Chairman, is the swearing-in set for 2 o'clock for these individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| The swearing-in session is at 2 o'clock today in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6552)|

| 1:49:32| Also, for all the candidates that have won a race today, you need to get with Jolie, who is the office manager of the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6572)|
| 1:49:42| If you have an escort that will escort you to the ceremony, she'll need to get that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| So please get with Jolie before you leave after this proceedings of selecting candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| That's aisle 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6596)|

| 1:50:41| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| I've got a quick question I was asking Commissioner Pinkson about the swearing-in ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| Who was the first nominee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Who was the first one nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| Jindal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Jindal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| I'd like to nominate Carol Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6661)|

| 1:51:03| Commissioner Luthod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Commissioner Moore? Pass. Commissioner Ballard? Pass. Commissioner Pinkston? Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6665)|
| 1:51:23| Is there anyone from the audience that would like to nominate someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6683)|
| 1:51:31| Mr. Chairman, I'll go ahead and nominate Amy Vandegriff. She was a winner in the Democrat primary and she showed up here so I'll just put her name so she can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6691)|
| 1:51:45| Well, on Ms. Vandegriff's behalf, I think the paper said that we may have had some conversation sidebar and I think I asked Mr. Arnett the same question the same day and the papers just refused to print it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6705)|
| 1:51:57| So we did not have conversation and I just asked both candidates if they wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| Are you putting Ms. Vandegriff's name? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| Is there anyone from the audience that would like to nominate someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| Ms. Vandegriff, since you're at the podium and you're a candidate, you can speak to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| Thank you. I decided to seek this vacant seat for the clerk's office only after an overwhelming encouragement from the public to clean up the mess that currently exists in the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6739)|
| 1:52:33| We are here today over a year later with a second chance to do the right thing. It is not hard to do the right thing when the right people step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6753)|
| 1:52:43| The only reason I wouldn't seek this position would be self-preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| Self-preservation is the good old boy way of thinking and I did not see this as an opportunity to have an advantage in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6767)|
| 1:52:58| My opponent has clearly stated he is not interested in serving the public through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| I am seeking this appointment for the same reason I am on the ballot in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| I want to be a part of restoring the public's trust in the government that serves them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| I knew in advance that once I announced my desire to seek this appointment, I would be a target for the media sources which have endorsed my opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6794)|
| 1:53:24| A person who has no experience in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| I weighed all the good old boy rhetoric they support against what the right thing to do is for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6808)|
| 1:53:37| I decided to stand up for them as a single voice representing their vote for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| I believe the powerful statement the voters recently made in the primary that they want change and they want it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| My phone has rung off the hook from voters asking me to seek this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| I stand up for them as their voice and symbol of that change at the hazard of my opponent and his media network placing me in their sights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6836)|
| 1:54:06| Right now this is front page news and everybody is watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6846)|
| 1:54:13| I want you and all of Knox County to know I plan to do the right thing now and I will continue to do the right thing even when no one is watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6853)|
| 1:54:23| Thank you and I would appreciate your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| Are there any questions for Ms. Vandiver-Griff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Did you know you were going to come speak this morning over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| Mr. Smith, I actually sat right back there and wrote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| Did you know you were going to speak Saturday morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| I knew I wanted to come because I have a vested interest in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| and only after listening to the other hopefuls speak was I moved to stand up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6888)|
| 1:54:58| See, that's what bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| On Saturday you said you didn't know you were going to speak but yet you walked up with a prepared speech and I thought this was planned from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| Well, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| We're not going to have that line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| It's kind of off, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| Any other commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| Thank you, Ms. Vandiver-Griff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Any other candidate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| Yes, my name is Elena Cash and I would like to nominate Michael Pusser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| He's a former employee in our office and has worked closely with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| and I believe that he would be the best candidate for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| He knows everything about our office, always has worked closely with Mr. Padgett and George and Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6943)|
| 1:55:51| And Mr. Tindall also mentioned his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| So I would like to nominate Michael Pusser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Thank you, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Although I had already asked for nominations from the floor, I'm going to allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Mr. Chairman, given the fact that we have not heard from Mr. Pusser and this is the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| if he's here, if he wouldn't mind coming down, I'd like to hear him give an explanation of his qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| and why he would like to have this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| He can be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=6981)|

| 1:58:26| We have a great office, a great bunch of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| And I would like to continue to keep the continuity in the office between now and the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7110)|

| 1:58:47| Any questions for Mr. Stooksbury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7127)|
| 1:58:54| Thank you, Mr. Stooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| Do you have something to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| Yes, just a statement, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| The last time we did these appointments, I voted for Mr. Tindall because I felt like he would do a good job in the office, and I believe he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| And I believe he brought a lot of innovative things as he appeared before us last Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| He gave us a prepared list of the things that he had accomplished in the office and things that were being worked on, and I appreciate his service for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| I've received a number of calls from employees in the office, and I believe that I served two constituencies here this morning with this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| One is the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| The other are the 170 employees of the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| And as far as I'm concerned on my vote, I believe that stability now is paramount for that office as we go forward in the next few weeks and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7170)|
| 1:59:39| The voters will decide this issue, but, again, just in the conversations I've had, I believe that as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7179)|
| 1:59:46| there needs to be stability in that office, and the stability needs to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| And so I will be casting my vote for Mr. Stooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| Just a quick question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7196)|

| 2:00:13| Just state my name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7213)|

| 2:04:51| We did this January 31st and we had Mr. Tindall, and I like Mr. Tindall, and I've commented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| on him and the great job he has done in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| But just to remind the individuals, Mr. Tindall was the most senior member on the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| and was term limited off, and then we put him right over to another position, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| think the public was just outraged by that maneuver, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=7510)|
