| 0:01:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| I'd like to take a moment just to talk about 1 John 1, starting with verse 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=96)|
| 0:01:46| We hear the words that these things we write unto you that your joy may be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=106)|
| 0:01:56| And what that joy is is that we say that we have fellowship with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| This then is the measure which we have heard of him and declared to you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=121)|
| 0:02:13| I'd like to take a moment to think about the issue of light in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| Light illuminates things where we can see them clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| Light takes away the darkness in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Light opens up our eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| We take away the way we view the world, and I think that sometimes in our youth we often view the world through a glass darkly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=150)|
| 0:02:40| But light illuminates the things we see and helps guide our paths in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| This reminds me of an incident years ago when there were several Boy Scouts out into the Great Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:56| They had the knowledge, the skills, and the abilities to go camping and hiking and enjoy the wilderness and be safe and secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=176)|
| 0:03:06| But on this particular occasion, the weather started turning bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| It started to rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| It started to get dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| They got their stuff together and decided it would be best to try to find their way back to the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| But as it got darker and darker, they realized that they couldn't see and they were lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| There was no light in their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| So they stopped for a moment and they prayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| In the middle of this storm, a huge lightning bolt struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| It was off in the distance, but when it hit this tree, it caused a fire, and this fire brought out a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=223)|
| 0:03:53| And they said, let's walk to the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| And as they walked and journeyed their way toward this target that they had in life, which was the light, when they arrived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=237)|
| 0:04:06| they were at the road, the road in which saved their lives and the road in which they were familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| And it was the light that brought them to that salvation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| And I think that's what the scripture is trying to tell us is that God is our light and that he is our guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| and that we should follow his light in our journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Our dear Heavenly Father, thank you for the opportunity for us to come together as a community, come together and to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:39| on behalf of Knox County, to come together as citizens and people who care about this community and the world in which we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=279)|
| 0:04:50| Help us look at these issues and problems through the light and through the glass brightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| In thy name we pray, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Would you please stand, face the flag, salute, and join me in reciting the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:18| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=318)|

| 0:15:01| You need to put your mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Thank you, Commissioner, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| My name is William Harry Sherrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| I live at 7309 Sherwood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| I'm here to address commissioners and I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| I may need ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I'll try to do it in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| There's been two issues in the Knoxville newspaper that has affected the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| relationship with myself and my 16-year-old grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Because of those articles, my 16-year-old grandson thinks that I might be a liar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| and that is totally untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| I would like to address first a trip to Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| I have a business in Kosovo and with me I have the license that I formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| I asked for it in April and received that license last June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| Sometime in August, I think, and you'll have to ask the mayor, is that the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| went to Kosovo with an official invitation from a mayor from Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| He has that and I'm sure he will present that to you if you would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| that official invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| It was not handled by me but by my president, Jack Thunderbird, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| I'm not sure I delivered that invitation or whether Mr. Thunderbird did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| I am trying to survive Atlas Electric Company, which has been in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| since 1983 and founded by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| My grandfather started Atlas in 1921 and then during the war, when he got sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| he closed Atlas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| And then my father and grandfather opened Sherrill Electric Company in 1947.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| In 1983, I owned Atlas, opened Atlas, in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| And it's very important to me that Atlas Electric survives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| It's been very difficult to survive with the newspaper, but I'm not here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| criticize the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I'm here to give you facts or answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| I do not remember if the mayor went with me on the trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| I do remember he and his assistant, Mary, went to meet three mayors in Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| I believe there are 17 mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| It's kind of like counties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| And I'll be glad to show you them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| But I went to two of those three meetings with Mayor Ragsdale and a contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| of people from Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| The invitation was essentially to form a sister city in the country of Kosovo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| with a city, or they call it providences, with another mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| So on that issue, Commissioner and Chairman, I would like to entertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| or answer any questions that anybody might have on the issue of Mayor Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| going to Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Again, I don't know if he went with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| I know he came back on the same flight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Please ask me any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| I'm trying to clear my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Did you say you had two parts to what you needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Go ahead and get the next part, and if any commissioners have a question on either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| then we'll get your five minutes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Then they can ask you at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| I've been crying for about two days, as you might be able to tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| because of this newspaper article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| But don't feel sorry for me, because I'm a lucky man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| I believe in exactly what you said about seeing the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| And the man upstairs has allowed me to be here today because of that newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| article that just came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| And I think I've been blogged about 200 times that I'm a liar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| and I might go to jail for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Well, first of all, I'm not a liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| I've worked undercover for the FBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| I have resigned today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| I've worked undercover for the FBI for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| and I have the credentials to show you if you'd like to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| The thing about the park, 15 years ago I was approached by Charles E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:25| Fraser, who developed Sea Pines, to assemble upwards to 3,000 acres for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I had to sign a confidentiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| I delivered to 132 residences I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| I delivered them approximately $200,000 for a one-year option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| This was way back during the days of a fellow named Miser, Derek Miser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| You may have remembered him if anybody's been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| So he gave me the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I signed a confidentiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| I knocked on doors with my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| We spent probably 1,000 man-hours or woman-hours assembling those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| The total cost then projected by Disney was a $2 billion theme attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| It was called American Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| I assembled that for two years, actually, one year, and then they asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| another year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Michael Eisner chose to choose the American Heritage themed attraction near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| Washington, D.C., in the state of Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| He spent $5 million designing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Then he was turned down by the governor and the legislature, the state and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Senate, and he was therefore fired for spending that $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| The feasibility study showed that if, and he chose there because the feasibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| study showed that if he built this themed attraction, which was going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| 200,000, I mean 20,000 jobs, 20,000 jobs, that it would cannibalize Disney World.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:11| Therefore, his board decided to put it in Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| The options expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Then there was 132 partials with, again, 134 partials with 3,200 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:31| Then many other people came along, but the biggest one, which I made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| presentation at an expense of $25,000 at Club LeConte with Victor Ash, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| think maybe some of you all were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Forest City Enterprises out of Cleveland, Ohio asked me to assemble, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| paid me over $150,000, and I paid for the secretary, to assemble 1,600 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| and that took 87 partials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| And it was all off of Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| Now, therefore, that land that I bought, and there's actually two people I bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| it from, Joyce Deaton, who's a relative, and Dick Chesney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| The paper didn't pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| There's 80 acres there about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| I have called Ben Davison to verify the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| I have that file somewhere that was five years ago about, and about 80 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| I sold all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| I've been accused of keeping some of it for myself, but it's clearly duly recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| that I sold it all at the request of a gentleman in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| and I'm not going to disclose his name, to sell that to the Development Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| so there could be a park, an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| I was explained by Mike Edwards it was going to be a business park, but I didn't know about it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| until they found out that I already had the options, and I sold it for 18,000 there about for the 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| And Mike Edwards and Laura Wood, I believe they bought the other 270 acres from the individual property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| I think there was 15 more, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And they paid almost 30,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| Mr. Sherrod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| I'd like to ask you to kind of wrap it up, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| So, therefore, I could have sold it to the county for about 30,000 or 12,000 more than I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| and I feel like I saved the county almost a million dollars on that 80 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| I also feel that if I had assembled it all, I am, I do own Waters French Broad Development Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| If I assembled it all, I would have saved you two million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Do not put a halo on my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I'm here to try to establish a relationship with my 16-year-old grandson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| because I've cried for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And please ask me any question at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Mr. Sherrod, I'm, you know, it touches my heart what's going on between you and your grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| Both you and myself were public figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| And after the famous people versus Larry Flint decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| you can pretty much say anything about a public figure that you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| And I hope that your grandson will understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| the normal protections against slander and libel aren't there for folks that are in the public eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| And myself as a commissioner and you as a businessman who's frequently in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| you know, we kind of have to take a hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| And I hope your grandson will understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| I know what it's like to be in the position that you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| One question, and also I want to make it very clear, me and Mr. Sherrod have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| I would never have called us close friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| There have been times that me and Mr. Sherrod have not gotten along very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| So I'm not, I don't want anybody to say I'm trying to defend a buddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| because there's been times that we weren't exactly buddies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| But I do want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| How much property do you own in East Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| Total, not what the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| We own 350 plus 34 plus 34, so 400 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| How much property do you, have you optioned or sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| or in somehow given the development corporation access to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| And what I'm wanting to know is percentage wise, you seem to own a lot of land in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| And I think it would be difficult to try to put a lot of land together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| without touching on one of your spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| And I'm just wondering how much land was involved with the development corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| My recollection is two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| The paper reported 49 or something that I bought from Ms. Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| And they did not refer to the land I bought from Chesney right next to Joyce's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| And I think they total about 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| But it's over a mile and a half from my property of 400 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| See, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| And that property has been in my family for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| But I'm saying how much land was this that the development corporation is interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| or has optioned or has purchased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| How many acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| About four years ago they did about 80 acres of their announced, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| I think they announced they bought 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| But how much of that belonged to you is what I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| How much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| I had it under option for Disney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| For an airstrip, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| I'd love to see an airstrip out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Well, I had it under option to build 11 baseball fields for the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| The man that owns the yard was going to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| A private company was going to buy it and operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| And that was going to create about 600 jobs at a cost of about $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Well, I guess what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| The only property I'm concerned with is the amount that we're going to be voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| the amount that the development corporation is interested in or has purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| I'm not sure whether they have an option or whether they purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| or is all of this land that the development corporation has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| was that your land or is there just a tiny portion of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| I had an option to buy it for a baseball field, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| And then I got a call that the county was buying 300 acres around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| And I, therefore, was, quote, coerced, or forced, that's a bad word, coerced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| to sell it to the county at my cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| And I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| And it was 80 out of 350 is what came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| 80 out of 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| That's what I had under option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| There was 10 acres I was trying to buy for a hotel that was going to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| on a corner of Midway and Thorn Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| And my understanding is that Victor Jernigan bought that for Wiggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| I guess the point that I'm looking at here is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| and I've seen all these hideous accusations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| And the truth is, is these accusations that the bloggers have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| these criminal charges that they're accusing you of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| there are agencies that look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| That's not the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| But there are agencies that look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| They read the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| And I'm sure if there's anything improper that they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| they've seen the same bloggers that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| I guess what I'm looking at is if the accusations that you acquired the land purposely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| to sell the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| if you had any insider knowledge, why didn't you buy it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| And so that's what makes me tend to believe that a man like yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| that owns a lot of land in a particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| it's kind of hard to go out into that area and acquire large parcels of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| without running across a piece that you own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| And I just, I hate that these accusations have been made against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| And I hate that it's affected your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| My whole family, my wife, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| I wish she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| She'd been crying for two days with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| We'd been in Chicago trying to negotiate a contract with Kosovanians with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| And I have those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Here's the documents that came from Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| I actually flew back to Chicago, drove from Atlanta today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| and that's why I look so cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| My initials, HS, Happy Spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| I'm happy this has happened so that I can address you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| because I'm under a lot of confidentiality because it's a private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| I can't divulge regretfully who asked me to put the 80 acres together for a baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| similar to one that was built in Memphis about six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Well, I just, you know, like I said, it looks like a relatively small piece of the total package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| And, you know, if any of these accusations are true, I'm sure there's people that look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| And I just don't want it to muddy the waters with what we've got to deal with here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| because it's frankly not the charge of the commission to look into those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| There are other entities that do that, and those entities read the papers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Well, once the county started assembling those lands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| I was getting phone calls by my friends and relatives, what is the county doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| And I didn't know until they called me and asked me to sell my options to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| I didn't sell the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| You don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| So I closed on the options, as I guaranteed I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| I was at great risk buying the land at $16,000 an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| because I didn't know at the time if the county was going to pay $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| And I could have lost millions on that transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| because the land was worth appraised by the county probably about $4,000 an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| and the county paid approximately, what I read in the paper, they paid $26,000 an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| for those partials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And they did close, to my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Did they close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| They closed on the two that I bought, and it closed with Ben Davidson at Tennessee Valley Title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| And thanks for being here to answer our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Those of us who sit up here, most of us have been the subject of these blogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| so we kind of understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Since you wanted to go on the record, I just want to ask you very directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| in looking at this newspaper article, which I brought in today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| there is an inference that you received insider information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| So my question is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Did you receive insider information from anyone in Knox County Government about what was about to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| and did you profit from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Well, first of all, I didn't profit, because I was obligated to buy the land for $16,000 there about Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| I don't know the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| To answer your question, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I don't get insider information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| It would be my friend that I gave $1,500, as it refers to Mr. Ragsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| that I played golf with for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I knew him from barbering memory because I'm a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| He is a friend, but he wouldn't give me that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| So where would I get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| So that reference of insider information is just hideous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| Pardon me for saying it that way, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Also, you had mentioned that you were coerced into selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Now, when you use the word coerced in your statement, that kind of perked my ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| So would you explain that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| I got a phone call from a very important person that was involved in the baseball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| And he asked me, he said, I wish to do what the county wants and needs in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:14| I'll build the baseball stadiums at a later date at a different location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| even though the feasibility study showed that the location for the baseball field at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| I mean, you would get off midway and turn left and drive straight to the ball fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| which had ponds in it, walkways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| One stadium was big enough to play 18-year-olds, which is almost a full-size stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| But it only seated about 4,000 to 6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| So it meant that if it was built, the county could hold events like, say, Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| and what, Farragut, that needs more room to play baseball, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| So the idea behind this person making this great donation and put his corporate name on that field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2035)|
| 0:34:03| was to provide a place that young men from age, what, 8 to 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| could learn to be a professional baseball player so they could go play at, say, the Smokies or higher up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| So it was a great concept and a great set of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| And the man at the yard, I can't even recall his name, it's been so many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| was going to be the manager of that new field, those new fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| I think there was 11, and I'm going by memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| I'll have to pull the plans out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| The one in Memphis, I think, had nine built on 60 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| And it included parking, an indoor training facility like the yard has off of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| And it was a great thing, I think, for East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| I would suggest that maybe a solution is let's build the ball stadiums like we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| I'm old enough to remember that when we built the jail in East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| we built a golf course around it to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| And I believe it's still there, and I think the jail is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| I don't mean to be sarcastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I thought it was a great idea to buffer a jail with a golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| and I think it might be, that's your decision, an idea to buffer a business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| with 11 baseball stadiums that will be national recognized baseball stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| so that people from all over the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| It was going, the feasibility studies show that it would take two new hotels to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| That's why I wanted the ten acres that Mr. Jernigan, I know he was involved in, I don't know if he closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| was, and I begged Mr. Jernigan to let me buy that ten acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| because I wanted to sell that to a hotelier, you know, on the corner of Thornbrook and Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| And also the feasibility shows there's going to have to be another hotel built for this national stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| for young people to be built at 398.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And that feasibility study wasn't free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| I just have a quick question because there's been many rumors and not a lot of clarity on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| Did you or did Atlas Electric pay for the mayor's trip to Kosovo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| There were several people that paid for the mayor's trip to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| I'm not at liberty because there was private individuals, corporations that are interested in going to Kosovo here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| I'm not at liberty to discuss who helped pay for that unless I call them and ask them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| I'll be glad to call the ones that paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Can I have one minute and ask one person if I can disclose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Do you actually need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| There's one person in this room helped pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| And without me asking him, I'm not going to disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| But you paid for part of the trip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| I'm Atlas Electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| And I thought it was the thing to do because I thought it was going to provide a lot of jobs for Knoxville and Atlas and even jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:14| We have people that, you know, I had to lay off that were going to move to Kosovo and do electrical work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| I have a general contractor's license in Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I've had it for over nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| And I got that license way before the mayor made a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| And he took his assistant, is it Mary Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| His assistant, I believe, is Mary Martin that works for the county school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| She took all the notes at all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| And it was very formal meetings, very well attended by all the Kosovoians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| We had upwards of times four interpreters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| And I still have working with me in Kosovo, a president that worked for Bechtel for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| And also I have three staff members of Kosovoians that I paid for out of Atlas Electric Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2275)|
| 0:38:03| We intend to survive Atlas Electric and come back as an electrical contractor here using funds and profits of Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| Because I lost $4 million, to be honest about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I appreciate that you wouldn't even tell anybody, but I guess I told everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| So in contracting business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| So I intend for Atlas Electric, for my grandson, to have that Atlas Electric survives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| Thank you, Mr. Sherrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| We have Bob Savory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| My name is Bob Savory, S-A-V-E-R-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| It's 9320 Camrose, C-A-M-R-O-S-E Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| That's Knoxville 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| I'm here to speak on education and educational funding because I know you've been asked again to make some concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| As a Knox County taxpayer, a father of two Carnes High School students and a Knox County teacher for 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:14| I'm here to let you know that I believe we wouldn't have to cut teachers or even look for additional funds if we closed the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| County Schools Country Club on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| They have several club annexes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Many of the multiple layers of supervisors and directors have little, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| effect on the education of the students of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| Many are just working on their best five years' retirement benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Some of the central office staff are worth their weight in gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| But the Donna Wrights and Becky Ashes and Monty Howes and Rodney Russells are few and far between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| How can we justify a superintendent's salary of $247,011 plus $14,400 in fringe benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2395)|
| 0:40:09| when the top pay in the United States in 2007 for governors was $206,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:19| Mayor Ragsdale was recently chastised when his pay went from $148,000 to $154,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| The U.N. Secretary General makes $225,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| The salary is comparable to a Nashville superintendent who makes $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| But comparable to absurd is still absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| Large numbers of supervisors and directors at the central office and its annexes make $90,000 plus salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| And, again, they have no direct impact on student learning or education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| The 71-page budget is fascinating reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| But it's a morale buster for teachers who do have a direct impact on students every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| The so-called cuts in the central office are an insult to teachers and the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| My accounting professor in graduate school explained creative finance to me well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| The central office gets an A-plus in smoke and mirrors finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| Our Knox County government needs to take control of this situation and bring reality and austerity back to our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:38| Our need for money will never go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| But you need to assure our taxpayers, parents, and teachers that we run a lean central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| where every person is directly influencing the education of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| The teachers of Knox County can take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| We have outperformed every other large metropolitan area in Tennessee since I came to Knox County 25 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:07| I would ask that you might require a staffing ratio for the folks across the street like they require a staffing ratio for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:16| We need to have proof from those folks that they have a direct correlation to the education and student learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:26| If we are to be a data-driven system, I would think that that's the data that you would demand from the folks across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Commissioner Lambert, I think you have a couple of questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Well, first I want to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| This is one of my teachers from Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| I graduated class of 85, one of the teachers that had a strong impact on my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| And I probably would not be here today were it not for some of the lessons that you taught me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| partially in science and partially just by the way you lived your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Running for office was like climbing a mountain, and I remember a teacher one summer that went and climbed a mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| Have you been mountain climbing any lately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Not lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Anyway, I do appreciate you coming here today, and I appreciate your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| and I'm sure you know what I'm about to tell you due to the results of a lawsuit that happened before I took this chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:34| The county commission has very little say-so in how the school board runs their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| In fact, that's why we call it the educational consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| But I think you've given us some wonderful data here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| and I hope that you'll take that to the school board as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| because they could probably use the information that you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| And, again, while you're here, thanks for the impact that you've had on my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you, Bob, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Bob and I go way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| I don't know, maybe Powell Middle School when I did my internship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| But we've been friends for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| We share a lot of common ground in terms of science and environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| and certainly do appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| We've tried to make that point, Bob, that we think that the emphasis is not directed to the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:32| and there is far too much weight given financially to the central office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| And I think they hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| I think they're starting to hear it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| They've called this attention or they've offered us the opportunity to delve into some of their finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| We'll continue to do that and we'll work to get more money in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Item 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2710)|

| 0:45:17| in the second commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| In order to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Governmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| In order to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Do you want to throw it into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| Whereas the outgoing presidents of neighborhood and community organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| comprising of the second commission district have generously given their time and talents to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| and improve the communities in said district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And whereas these leaders have set forth an inspiring example of other residents of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| And whereas these individuals have volunteered for a demanding and complex job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| and often not received the thanks and appreciation they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Whereas the Knox County Commission is desirous in recognizing and extending their heartfelt thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| to the citizens named herein for their dedication and significant contributions to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| and especially to the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| That Knox County Commission honors the outgoing presidents of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| and community organizations in the second commission district as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| James Pierce, Historic North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2787)|

| 0:46:42| Kelly Scott, Highland Neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| Karen Carroll, North Hills Garden Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Ray Abbas, Fulton Alumni Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Sharman Froth, North Knoxville Business and Professional Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the above named leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| in the second commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Be it further resolved that if any of the other notifications are to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| to effectuate this resolution, then the county clerk is hereby requested to forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| a copy of this resolution to the proper authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:25| I'm sorry that Commissioner Harmon is not here today either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Kelly Scott was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Has she stepped out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| She's one of the outgoing presidents we're honoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| This is Ray Abbas who is the outgoing president of the Fulton High School Alumni Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| and he's done a tremendous job promoting Fulton and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| And I think that the second district is probably one of the best organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| in terms of civic groups and neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| We probably have more than a couple dozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| And these are honoring the presidents who are outgoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| We have a new group of presidents that are rotating in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| Not all the neighborhood associations are set up the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| Some of them have two or three year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| We have a couple who have had the same president since they were put together years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| But I think that having such a strong network of organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| in the second district is a real benefit to the elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| who serve those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| So I just wanted to let them know how much Mark and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| the work that they do in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| It's all volunteer and it's often very thankless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| And the effort that they put out making our community a better place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| is I think one of the main reasons that the second district is such a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| So thank you, Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2932)|
| 0:49:01| 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| On page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| establishing a general county budget and making appropriations for the several funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| for departments, institutions, offices and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| and ending June 30, 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| and approving the organization of the executive branch of Knox County Government Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Five-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the budget that was presented to us with a few amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| Mr. Troyer, would you like to explain some of these amendments that you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:56| And have you passed this out to the commissioners yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| No, I have not passed it out, but I have copies here for all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| What I'd like to say is that after the mayor had proposed the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| we sent out a memo to all the different departments and asking them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| is there anything else that you would like to change in your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| If you'd like to discuss if you have any issues with your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| We did get some feedback from some of the departments, namely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| about how they'd like to rework their numbers within their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| And that's what we have presented here is just some feedback from the departments asking to change line items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| within the proposed amount for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| So it doesn't change the bottom line, it's just changing within their departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| And so the net result of all these changes, there's no change to the bottom line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| It's just more of an accounting purposes that we're making these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| just so that we'll have the line items correctly filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| We have a motion that's properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Hey, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Did we do the contracted services for KVFD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| We change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| That part of your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| That's written into the budget resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| What is that, Commissioner, the abbreviation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Karnes Volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| The volunteer fire departments are under contracted services and they have been left out for many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| many years and now we're trying to get them in the budget a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| Commissioner Boyle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Mr. Troyer, another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| The departments such as solid waste that are given a budget for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| what other ones besides solid waste are allowed to carry over money from one year to the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3112)|
| 0:52:01| Normally departments are not allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Occasionally we bring forward or we would get input back from the different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| and they would say that they are not quite through with the project and would like to ask permission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| Normally the mechanics to do that is we would ask for the commission's approval to designate and appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| and that just means to save the money over from this year and allow them to spend it in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| If it's June or July, we would have a separate resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| and bring forward a number of items for the commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| Outside of that list, we allow just the capital projects to carry forward and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| Well, what happens if they get down to the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| and they've got $200,000 left in a particular budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| It's supposed to go back to the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| It will go back to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| And so that's one of the things that did not necessarily get into the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| about we put some money in there to use out of the fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| but every year there's a certain amount that goes back to the fund balance to replenish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Is there any checks and balances to see that this doesn't get dumped to some pet project somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| We take legislative approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| If it's already in their budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| To carry it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| It would take a legislative budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| To spend it before the budget year ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Once the budget is approved, then it's up to the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| whether it's department, agency, office holder, it's under their jurisdiction to be able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| to make those choices within the budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| But, so in other words, if X department has $200,000 left over and it's June 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| they could say, okay, I'm going to give this $200,000 to the zoo or to Iams or to ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| And it would have to be through or if they're going to, you know, buy something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| they still need to go through the purchasing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| If they're making a donation, does it still have to go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| It would still need to go through the process that's outlined through tenancy law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Mr. Troyer, and this is probably, this is a tough budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| but this is probably going to be one of the smoothest budgets because it is so tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| I don't think there's a lot of fat in this budget at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| One thing I'd like to ask about, though, is we do have a contract for a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| And I am a firm believer in lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Maybe I'll try to be one when I grow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| But we have a new administration that will be coming in partially through this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| And I understand the lobbying contract is one that can be terminated at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| But what I'm wondering, it would be more difficult for the next administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| to have to terminate an existing contract and create a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| Is there any way that the lobbyist contract could be prorated for the months that he would serve this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:24| and we have that contract coming to an end and then the next administration would have a choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| Of course, I know they have a choice anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| But that choice would be more clear that they could then start a new contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| or they could also maybe open the contract up for bids if they chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| Is there any way that we could do that and prorate that amount so that we would still have money in the budget to hire a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:55| But the next administration wouldn't have to terminate a contract where they just would start bidding a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3355)|
| 0:56:05| You know, that would not be a bad approach at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| And I like our current lobbyist and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| and would have no problem if the next administration chose to keep him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| I just like it to be nice and clean where when the new administration comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| they can instead of having to terminate something if they chose to where they could just start fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| And there's a number of details that the mayor has already started working through some of those details as far as the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| and how to make a smooth transition, whoever the next mayor may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| And so that's just going to be one of the pieces to the puzzle to make sure a good smooth transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| I would like to add that, you know, out of the other feedback that we got from the different departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| we did get some feedback from our assessor of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| He has a reappraisal grant through the state of Tennessee, which is at risk of being funded through the state budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| And we are working with him on several different options on how to best address that potential loss of a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:08| And I would expect that we're, one, find out for sure from the state before next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| and then, two, that we have a couple of different scenarios that we plan to bring forth to the full commission next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| And, Mike, did you have something you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Just that that contract, the way it's written, it's a monthly fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| And it can be terminated on a 30-day's notice by either party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| So as soon as a new administration comes in, they can give a 30-day notice and contract with someone new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| Yeah, but I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Could it be rewritten to where it ends automatically and the next administration would need to start a fresh contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:51| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| I believe the most recent iteration of that contract reads that it is due for renewal in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| That being the case, you can just send a notice of non-renewal and then it dies, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| Yeah, but we would need from July to, we'd need another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| Could we change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Well, then what we could do is month-to-month if it's a mutual assent of the parties, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| And that's, it is basically a month-to-month now because they invoice on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| And any time the county would want to, and we've, as Mr. Troyer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| there's been discussions with, you know, with the lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| And he fully understands that that's a position that will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| or that's a contract that will be the choice of the new administration to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| And I think he's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Yes, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3533)|
| 0:59:03| We're approving the organization of the executive branch with this vote, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| Is that not what I'm reading here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| What's this new position being added in the mayor's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| And why are we adding someone when he's going out and this should be left up to the coming mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| Yeah, I'm glad you asked that question because the mayor's administrative assistant took a job with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| And that position is open right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| There's nobody filling that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| The mayor's trying to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| And what the mayor has done is taken a part-time position and made that a full-time position in order to do the duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3577)|
| 0:59:46| And so we are doing the duties with a full-time position, what used to be done with a full-time plus a part-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| Our thought process on this is to give the incoming mayor some flexibility on how to best staff the incoming mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3593)|
| 1:00:03| This budget summary I have here, which you put out apparently, it doesn't show a part-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| It shows nine full-time positions, no part-time, and it's going to ten full-time positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| Yeah, but it's being staffed with what was a part-time position to a full-time position now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| Why wasn't there a part-time position listed in 09?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| You know, I don't have the information right in front of me, but this is a money-saving change in responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:40| And so I think it makes good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| It makes good sense for the current staff to try to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| And it makes good sense for the incoming mayor to be able to have whatever administrative assistant he wants to bring with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:56| Well, I noticed in the purchasing department here you're taking two people out of it and put it into this e-purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| But yet the budget is going up about $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| And I'm glad you brought that up, too, because a couple of different points about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| On the purchasing, this is just at the request of the purchasing director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| And this is the way that he wants to best manage his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| There is one position that's transferred from the community development office into the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| And that's just a lateral transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| There's no raise involved, just a change in assignment and change in duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| And so we had a person move from community development and move into purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| And from that purchasing group, two people were split off to run the e-government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| And one of the things that the purchasing director wanted to be able to show is that the revenues from that program more than fully provide for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| And so that program will pay for itself through the rebates that we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| I think it makes great sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| I think it's a good approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| Well, last year it showed he had 11 positions in purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| We're taking two out and creating this e-purchasing, but it still shows he has nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| And there were no part-time positions in that either, but yet the budget's going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| Right, and the community development budget goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| So I'm real comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| I think we get a great value from our purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| I think the purchasing department saves us millions of dollars every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| And I think we need to support the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:45| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| I wanted to talk to Dr. McIntyre a little bit about schools, but I'll wait my turn if somebody wants to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| You want me to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:13| I just wanted to say thank you for complying with my request on the salary information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| And I suppose I could just start off as a follow-up to some of the things that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| Savory had to say, and I'd like for you to give you an opportunity to respond to some of the things that we felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:33| I haven't seen Mr. Savory probably personally in, oh, ten years, talked to him five to ten years, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:42| But he certainly has articulated what I think is a feeling, a sense of what many veteran teachers feel in this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:59| You've done some things or chosen to make some decisions, such as the latest one about how to ask the teachers whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:07| want to forego their stepping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Those types of things, I think that's, in my view, it's a misstep, but I'm sure you all thought that was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:19| So I guess, first of all, I just want you to respond to his primary position about central office staffing and the indication that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:32| indeed, it is not lame when we look at, we know that you've, in your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| you have 51 people budgeted to have 90,000 plus salaries in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| You have 63 people that have 80 plus salaries to be coming in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| And so I guess, first of all, just respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you for the opportunity to be here to address the commission again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| I guess I'd like to start by thanking many of you who attended many of our high school graduations over the last several days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| We had, if you include the Knoxville Adaptive Education Center and the adult program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| I believe we had 15 high school graduations over the last three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| And they were truly remarkable to see many of the wonderful things that our students are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| The first ever high school graduation for Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| We were at the Fulton High School graduation, and the student speaker was just awe-inspiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| A student who had come to us from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| whose dad had passed away during his high school career, and who had overcome so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| and yet there he was on the stage receiving his diploma, giving an inspirational message to his fellow students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| And that really is what it's all about for us, is educating students effectively and well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| and giving them the opportunity to be successful in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| So thank you for those of you who were able to attend some of those graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| I think it's important, Commissioner Norman, as I answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| to make sure we posit that in the context of this budget development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| And I know we collectively have talked a lot about that, but I'm not sure everyone who may be observing these proceedings is aware of all that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| So let me just, with your indulgence, take 30 seconds and give a little bit of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| We began the 2011 budget development process with a gap of about $19 million in the Knox County Schools budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| between what we saw as expected revenues and likely expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| We've worked over the last several months, and in fact, I've been before this commission several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| to talk about some of the challenges that we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Things like, you know, obligations that we have, like health insurance and salary step obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| and also about a $5.7 million increase in our pensions, which are all challenges in terms of expenditure, growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| and yet our revenues are relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| And so it's a very difficult economic environment, and it's a very difficult budget environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| Families are hurting, businesses are hurting, and yes, governmental organizations and school districts find themselves challenged as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| But over the last several months, we've worked very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| We've identified some very difficult choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| We've identified some fairly unattractive tradeoffs, but we've gotten to a balanced budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| and the school board adopted that balanced budget of $378.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| But also, I think, with the recognition that no one was entirely satisfied with where we ended up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| We think we created a fiscally responsible and educationally responsible budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| but the board, in its wisdom, asked respectfully if there are any additional revenues that could be identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| by the commission, for those to be provided to further mitigate some of the reductions in teacher positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| in particular, that we've had to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| Throughout this budget development process, specifically to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| we have kept in the forefront of our thinking, in our mind, the fact that we need to be making sure that our priority is classroom instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4077)|
| 1:08:07| making sure that the resources that we allocate are going to allow our teachers to be effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| and our students to learn at high levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| And so we have proposed, in this budget that's been adopted by the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| reductions in our central office infrastructure of between 4% and 9%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| 4% in administrative departments, 5.6% in operations and maintenance, 9% in technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| whereas this budget represents about a 1.5% reduction in instruction and instructional support areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| So we recognize the challenge, we recognize the fact that we need to look deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| and make deeper cuts in the central office than anywhere else in a difficult economic environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| and we believe we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| In terms of salaries and in terms of the salaries of central office administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| and the numbers of central office administrators, we've shared with the commission several analyses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| some of which showed comparisons with similarly situated school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| that show that our administrators are at average or below average in terms of similarly situated school districts in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:17| And, in fact, a study commissioned, I believe it was by the commission and the board before I got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| by a firm by the name of MJLM, actually found that quite contrary to the perception that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| that our central office infrastructure is actually quite lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Their recommendation at that point in time was that we add central office positions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| My take on this is that we obviously need to make sure that we prioritize our resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| and organize our resources in ways that are best going to be able to allow us to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| an outstanding education for every child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| And so we want to make sure we prioritize the spending in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| and make sure that we have a great teacher in front of every classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| But there's also a legitimate role for a central office infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| There's an important role, I think, to be played in terms of leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| in terms of direction, in terms of guidance and support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| so that our schools can be effective and provide a great education to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| I will note, and it's not directly to your question, but I will note that over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| we've recommended to the Board of Education some additional reductions and reallocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| that will allow us to restore seven teaching positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| We have heard from the commission, we have heard from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| we have heard from the public and teachers in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| that no one's entirely satisfied with the budget of where we are, and neither are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| So we've continued to work, we've continued to really scrutinize our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| to find additional areas that we can make reductions in order to restore teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| And so we've identified about $350,000 that will allow us to restore seven teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| Some of those ideas really came from conversations that we've had in this chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| And I think we want to make sure that you understand that we are listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| that we are interested in making sure we organize our resources in ways that best support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| our ambitious agenda and our ambitious goal of excellence for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| I also want to, if I may clarify one other thing, and that is, I think it was Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| who asked me the other day about if we get additional revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| will they go to restoring teacher positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| And the answer to that question, probably more directly, is yes, they absolutely will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Any dollars that we receive over and above the $378.7 million will go toward restoring teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| I think we got into a conversation about whether it would be the exact positions that have been cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| and I think there's some opportunity if a marketing position or a driver's aid position has been cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| and a school wants to restore a chemistry position instead, that there's some opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| But the bottom line is, any additional resources that we receive from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| if such resources might be available, will go toward restoring teacher position reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| and or teacher aid reductions, but teacher position reductions first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| I just appreciate you going back and reevaluating some things that you can do to restore those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:20| I know you don't want to remove anybody from the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| You know what kind of dramatic effect that has both on students, staff, the whole structure of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:32| It's the worst thing that can happen is to reduce the number of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| increase the number of the student-teacher ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| It's the worst thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| There was a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| I just wanted to, in terms of the $1.73 million, a friend of mine did an analysis of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| and shared that with me, and I thought it was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| I thought I'd do that just right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| If the budget, 378, was equated to a household budget of $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| what you are requesting in the 1.73 million is less than one-half of 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| If you plug that into a household budget, that would be somebody that made $100,000 for the household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| That would be about $460.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| And so, in effect, what you're saying by coming to us with 1.73,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| the threat of laying off teachers, you're saying that I can't come up with $460| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| to avoid a critical service to this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| So I'm glad that you can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I'm glad that we're avoiding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| You've probably got me for about four more years since I'm unopposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| This is a primary topic for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| I'll continue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| And I still feel that there's much to do in terms of leaning up the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| And I will continue to dig into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| And I'm doing it for the sake of the teachers who are my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| and who I greatly respect every day going to war, doing the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| carrying the water for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| I know they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| And I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| We have an outstanding core of educators in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| And I've had the opportunity to see them in action in their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| They do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| And they are the backbone, obviously, of our school district and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| I would respectfully submit two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| One, your analysis may be, in fact, accurate if you take it down to a household level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:44| But please know that, as I mentioned at the outset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| this is a budget development process where we started with about a $19 million gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| So it's not just this little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| We've made reductions, reallocations, found efficiencies that total $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| And so it is that bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| And please know it's not a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| And use that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| It's not a threat of additional reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| It's really just where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| The board has adopted a balanced budget before you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| They've also simply requested that there be additional revenues if available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| And I understand that that would be extraordinarily challenging in this economic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| But if there were additional revenues available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| they request those be provided to the Knox County schools to help us mitigate some of the reductions that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| Last note is we've identified an additional $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| So we're really not talking about $1.7 million anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| We're talking about about $1.4 million to get us to a net zero in terms of reductions of teacher positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| and a reduction of teacher aid positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| And thank you for looking over the weekend while you're graduating several thousand students or some thousand students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| A lot of handshakes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| When you talk about the $19 million deficit that you started with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| now is that the government $19 million where these are the things we'd like to do if we had the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| Or are these just the real cost of the school system going up at status quo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| It was our starting point in terms of what we thought the obligations were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| and what we thought the revenues would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| With no additional programs or no additional anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| At that point, I think we had identified a few priorities in terms of things like our strategic planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| our strategic plan that we've put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I think we had identified a couple of priorities in terms of things like our leadership academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| which now we're paying for through Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| So there are definitely things that we said, okay, in this really difficult budget environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| we can either do without or roll out over a longer period of time or find an alternative funding source for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| So it was sort of the starting point of where we wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| That was our biggest wish list, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| Our biggest wish list would have been much greater than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| It was really a very short list of things that we had identified in our strategic plan that had a specific cost attached to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:21| It was relatively modest, but it was the things that we thought were the highest priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| that required funding within that strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| And just one quick, you know, this process has been eye-opening for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| I mean, I've learned a lot in the last two weeks with the central office and speaking to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| Did we look at the insurance policy, what it would save?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| Dr. Thomas is moving a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Mr. Thomas can speak to that a little bit, and we've done some analysis there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| and I'll let him speak to the results of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4672)|
| 1:18:03| Yes, Commissioner, we did look at the health insurance, and it looks like from our calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| we used the percentages that applied to the county employees because if you didn't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| you would have people on the same plan treated differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| But looking at classified employees, because the county pays more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| it would cost us about $199,950 more than what the board is currently spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| And if you look at certified, I think the total was about $1,468,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| What percentage do you pay of the teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| It varies from about 55% on one plan to a high of, I think, 75% on the highest paid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:48| And I believe the county, I'm not as familiar with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| I think it's 76-24, maybe, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| That may be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| So, but if you used your percentages, you would have saved an enormous amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| We just didn't have time to run that calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| We will run it, but, again, in looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| I thought the easiest thing to do within the couple of days we had was to take the county plan as it exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| and then apply it to our classified employees that are currently covered under insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| You know, like Tony said, I'm probably going to be around a little while longer, six years actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:31| I think that we can come together on some things that when the state redoes the insurance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| I think we can find some money that takes money away from other things and puts it back in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| Because I don't, as much respect as I have for the both of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| I don't think that, I don't think every position in central office is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| And I don't think that, I think we could move some of those people back to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| That's just my personal opinion, not being an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| But I can see from the outside looking in, I can see we've got curriculum folks for every grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| and then we've got a coach on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Some of those duties, you know, Grant Rosenberg, he's in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| and he's taken on three titles in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| And I think there's a little room for that across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| I think there's some room for some, I mean, you know, the teachers essentially are getting a 4.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| or a 5% raise depending on what the state funds them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| And I'm not so sure that that was a selfish vote on their part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| because I think it was a, they're getting tired of being the bottom of the barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| And so I think that we've got a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| I think when all the money's coming in and everybody's getting what they want, it's all rosy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| But whenever it comes down to lean times, we find out our character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| And I think we need to really find out where we want to send our education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| Mr. McIntyre, I appreciate the way that you handled the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| And, you know, I didn't follow it real, real close because I'm not the school board representative, you know, for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| But from what I saw and read, I think you've done it different from other superintendents in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| And I appreciate your professionalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| I also want to say something to India Kinkana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| India, as far as being the chairman, India was a great lobbyist for your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| India, you did a great job in trying to fight for the teachers and for the bottom line for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| I think you did an excellent job out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| I was just curious, did any other county commissioners get a phone call from their school board representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| I didn't get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| Not my school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Did yours call you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| I talked to both of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Did they call you or did you call them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| One called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| The other one I called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| You know, I was just sort of disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| And I was really, I was sort of disappointed in the way that it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| You know, Dr. McIntyre, you came up with the budget and said, here's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| And then you took it to the other committee and they said, well, no, we're going to go the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| Then you had somebody that's running for reelection for school board and said, let's send it to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| Let's let them see what they'll do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| You know, that was their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| We can make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| We can make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| But for the individual that was up for reelection, say, well, let's send it over to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| and let them, you know, take the hit up or down for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| You know, I didn't think that was very professional, the way they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Another question that I had, we talked about the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| And the quote in the paper today is some $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| And I happen to be on the parking committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| And we came up with the figure, the PBA came up with the figure of over $26,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| I don't know if you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Commissioner, well, first of all, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| We did, after our, I believe it was after our most recent conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| we did get the recommendations of the parking committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| And our original proposal was to reduce the parking subsidy for all central office administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| But once we received the recommendations of the parking committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| it just made sense to eliminate that parking subsidy for all of our central office employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| I believe that saves us a total of $48,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| So the $20,000 was just the second part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Well, and we told that to the school board representative that was there sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| We just saved you a school teacher's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Go tell Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| And I wish he had told you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| And then one other question that I had, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| I'm here for information, too, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| I'm reading in the paper today this $400,000 for professional development, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:54| You've knocked that down to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I don't know if it's anything like in my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| A lot of people in the state hold state licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| You know, teachers hold certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| You know, Mike Brown used to hold an insurance license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| I hold an insurance license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| And there's several licenses that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Attorneys hold them, real estate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| And we pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| We pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| I can have, and, Mike Brown, you can identify with this as an insurance agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| We're going to have a whole lot of initials after our names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| All these classes and stuff that we want to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| I pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| And, you know, the end result is you're going to make more money, supposedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Same thing with the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| I just sort of have a problem with the taxpayers paying for teachers to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| when they're going to make more money off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| If they want that, then they should go and pay that and then let them make all the money they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| But I don't think it's the taxpayers that need to be paying if they're the ones going to be making more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| They should pay that out of their own pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Now, maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| If I can clarify, Commissioner, the dollars that we're talking about are not necessarily for our teachers to take courses outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| which then would lead to a higher salary on our salary matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| It's really about how do we improve the quality of instruction in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| And it's, to be honest with you, it's a very modest sum, even more modest today than it was last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| because we cut it from $400,000 to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| It's a very small amount per teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| I think it's critical, and Commissioner Norman, I'm sure, can weigh in on this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| but it is critical for our teachers to be able to continuously improve the quality of the instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| And I think you can do that in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| One is the more traditional professional development, which is often content-specific workshops and seminars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| where you might talk about the content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Another is the pedagogy and the specific instructional strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| And I think we've tried to focus a lot on collaborative professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| And so we feel like there's an opportunity to make this reduction in a way that won't be, at least for one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5153)|
| 1:26:01| that won't be harmful because we've done so much more of that collaborative professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| But it really is quite a small amount for a school district our size to invest in our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| That's really what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| It's about investing in our folks, helping them to continually improve their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| But, again, we're glad to make that reduction in order to fund a couple more teacher positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| and I think it's a good tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| You're probably not aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| There are several schools that have foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I don't know if you know the figure, but I'm president for the one central high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| and all we do is take and we fund these teachers that want to better educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| We give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| We raise thousands of dollars every year, and we give that for teachers to go to Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| to take a class or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| But so other schools may do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| Mr. Chairman, that is all I had on the school, but I do have some questions on other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| but I'll just address those because I know his time is important and the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| So I'll get to the other questions a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Dr. McIntyre, good to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| The other day when you were here, I asked you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| I want to ask you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| One was how many real live human beings and bodies were going to be displaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| and the answer you gave me was 10 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| And so you walk back today and say we've saved seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| We've saved seven additional positions, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| So now we're down to two to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Well, again, Commissioner Armstrong, what we've done is we've said we're going to restore seven teaching positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:38| What we don't know yet is, you know, we've developed a very, we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| equitable and transparent methodology for allocating resources to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| So we're going to have to figure out where those restorations will go back to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| I suspect it will be at the middle school or high school level primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| because that's primarily where the cuts have come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| And I think that will help us determine what the ultimate number would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| And, you know, hopefully if we restore seven teacher positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| that will at least mitigate that by, again, by a couple of real people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| that may not have to be laid off because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Okay, well, that's why I was asking the other day, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| we were talking about positions, we're talking about slots, we're talking about real human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| And so are we talking about positions, we're talking about slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| or are we talking about real human beings when we're talking about restoring seven positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| We're talking about, I mean, the broader conversation is about all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| I believe I answered your question by saying 12 to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| I can go back and we can both go back and look at the record, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| But I believe it was in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I hope that by restoring seven positions that that means we'll get it down to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| the 12 side or lower than on the 15 side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Okay, so if we're at 12 and how much money are we looking at now, 1.4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| So we're looking at $116,000 a position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:04| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Again, you're talking about people versus positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| We were at 30 positions, teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| So we're at 23 net teacher positions now and 10 teacher aid positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| So I don't like to do math in public, but I think that's about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| That wasn't where we were the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| No, we're seven positions better off than we were the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Commissioner McIntyre, sitting here listening to all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| and some of the comments from Commissioner Norman, Anders, and Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| this problem didn't start this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| We're a victim of our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| It's only natural that people move up in the ranks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| and you move into supervisory positions based on longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| and also on your talents and so forth and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| and those naturally are the most highest paid positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| which is what's created the problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| I mean, I heard about heavy in the central office long before I sat on this board up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:20| I had a sister who came through the system and retired out of the system as a supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| I have friends who are teaching, and we talk occasionally about some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:35| When you have you looked at, we're looking at this sheet that we got today here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| 66 people in the central office making over $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| How many of these are going to be retiring in the next two years, three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| I mean, we're talking about a band-aid we're trying to put on this thing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| We've got to look down the road the next five to ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| if we're going to educate ourselves out of this, and we've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| How many of these positions are going to be vacated up here that a cheaper person, for want of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:13| let me rephrase that, a lower paid person could move into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| There was a, in one of the letters to the editor today, from a first grade teacher at one of our local schools who was a Ph.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:32| I didn't realize that it was required to have a Ph.D. to teach first grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| I don't know how long she's been with the system, but it just seems like placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| maybe that's where she wants to be in a first grade teacher, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| But it seems like placement is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| If it means putting some of these higher paid people, you know, combining some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| like we've talked about the grants department earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| putting them back into the classroom and filling some of these slots that we have open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| We're in a position right now, which we're going to be talking about later today, economic times are bad right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| We're all up to tying our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| The county employees haven't had a raise in a couple of years or more, three years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| So it looks bad when we say, okay, we're going to have to rob from Peter over here to pay Paul to keep Paul, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:28| happy and on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| And that makes it difficult for us up here, really it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| And we're not in a job, as has been pointed out two or three times here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| it's not our position to micromanage what the school board does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| That's what those folks are elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| But I didn't get a call from my school board member saying, do you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| or would you suggest this or whatever this year or last year or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| So there seems to be kind of a breakdown in communication somewhere along the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| If we're going to get out of this mess, we're going to have to all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| So I'd just like to know if you've looked at this and what your, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| prospected or projected retirements are through attrition, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| in these higher paid positions in supervisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| The short answer is I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| We do make some projection for attrition every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| We look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| We make some assumptions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| But to be honest with you, in terms of the specific positions you're talking about, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| I'd like to address two other things you talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| One is the school board, and to be quite honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| I think the school board very specifically asked me to be here before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| And, again, I think this is my eighth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| or ninth time before you talking about this budget, the fiscal 2011 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| So the school board did ask me to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| They did ask me to communicate with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| They did ask me to keep you informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| So the fact that you didn't get a call from a specific board member, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| is because they directed me to try to communicate with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| and also had a meeting where the commissioners were invited, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| last week or the week before to try to provide information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| And many of you were able to attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| I think you're right that it is a longer-term issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| and I think other commissioners have mentioned that, Commissioner Norman and Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| And I think we'll have to look at it on a long-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| And I think we'll have to look at it from the perspective of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| And I think the place where we really have to look and really have to look hard is we need talented people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| and we have talented people, but we need to keep talented people over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| And in order to do that, we have to pay them commensurate with their ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| I'm not talking solely about central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| I'm talking more about teachers because our teacher salary schedule is not where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| Our teacher salary schedule is not even competitive in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| With other school districts like Oak Ridge and Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| And so over time, we've got sort of this structural fiscal issue that we're going to probably be up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| be before you time and time again talking about unless we really think collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| think very hard about how we deal with that and find some long-term solutions to funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| and making an appropriate investment in the level of funding we provide for educating our kids in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| So I think it's a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| It's a long-term issue and one that I think we'll have to grapple with over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| Well, one thing I'm concerned about, and I know the step race system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| is that if we have a $90,000 supervisor retiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| that we don't take a $55,000 qualified person for the job and put them in that job at $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:43| That wouldn't be right in my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| No, it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| And, Commissioner, we have done some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Last year, we cut the supervisor for mathematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| and allowed the two mathematics specialists to take those duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| This year, we've cut the driver's ed supervisor, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| So, you know, I think we're very cognizant of those issues and those challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| We're trying our very best to make sure that we are responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| and using the taxpayer's dollars efficiently and effectively to support the education of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| We're working hard to make sure we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| for providing us all the information we've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| I much prefer your style as opposed to the previous superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| because, as Ms. Kincannon said when she was standing here just a few days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| they would come to us with a budget of $20 million to $30 million more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| than they thought that they really needed and just wanting to see what they could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| I feel like that you have taken a more deliberate approach, and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| because I think you've looked at it, you've sharpened your pencil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| and you've said this is what we need to have a competitive education given our finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| So, again, I want to thank you for being up front and being a stand-up guy on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| With that, I want to again thank you for providing us with the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| I think it's important that our citizens know that the amount of money that will be spent on education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| in Knox County, Tennessee in the coming year is projected to be $457.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| The $378 million is the local portion, but when you add the federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| you add to the Race to the Top fund, school construction, the partnership, $457.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| That's almost a half a billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Now, some would say that's not enough, and some would say that's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| We've all received emails over the last few days, some coming in and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| give them what they want or give them what they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| and if you don't, you're not in favor of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| Now, go ahead and increase taxes a penny or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| The issue that I have with a tax increase is when you look at the history of tax increases in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| I wasn't on the commission at that time, but the commission raised taxes 58 cents to pay for a justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| The justice center was never built, but yet the tax was never rolled back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| People remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Wheel tax, for example, a lot of people voted on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| thinking that the money was going to go toward education, and some of it has, but not all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| So when we look at tax increases, the issue that I've got as a commissioner and as a citizen, one who pays those taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| I want to make sure that I know exactly what that money is going to be spent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| The issue that I've got with increasing taxes, maybe a penny or a penny and a half or two pennies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| is I really don't know what it's going to go for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| I know that you've told us that it's going to go for restoring positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| but you don't know if it's going to be for a chemistry teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| You don't know if it's going to be for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| And you've said, and I think this is a good philosophy, is let's go back to the local schools and see what they need the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| But I guess the issue that I have as someone who has to vote to take money out of people's pockets is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| if I don't know exactly what that money is going to be used for, given the history of these tax increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| that's a big issue that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Now, I don't know that I'm going to be here next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| I'm not fortunate like my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| The voters will decide my fate on August 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| But if I am fortunate enough to be here, one of the things I want to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| and my priority is going to be funding for education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| it's time for us as a community to sit down and say, where do we want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| Where do we want to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| I mean, the direction do we want to move in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| Like it or not, the perception is the central office is bloated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| Now, it may be, it may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| That's the perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| It's from the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| It's from the community, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| I think that a challenge that you have, and you've only been here a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| is to let the community know that this central office is, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| functioning the way it needs to function, and here is what this central office is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| If you can't do that, then I think that this whole notion of the central office being overpaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| and overstaffed is just going to continue to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| and it's going to continue to be at the heart of the discussion we have about taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| I would also ask you, as I mentioned last time, look at this warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| When we have a million dollars' worth of inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| I think that with the technology that we have now, that's a bit much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| There may be an opportunity there to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| But above and beyond that, I wanted to just ask a couple more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| and dovetail on what Commissioner Armstrong had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| and that is how many actual people are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| If we're talking about 12 and we've restored seven, then we're looking at five, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:18| Would you say that's a fair assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| Commissioner, I think that's an oversimplification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| Where we are right now is we have a net reduction of 30 teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| What we know, I believe as of Thursday or Friday, that that impacts 19 teachers, people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| who at this point in time we have not been able to find a specific placement for in their licensure area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| What I said to Commissioner Armstrong the other day was we will continue to try to identify positions for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| We'll probably have some retirements and resignations over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| and that I thought at the end of the day where we might end up is between 12 and 15 actual people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| who we are not able to find a placement for who would actually be laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| I hope that the additional restorations that we've identified will allow us to reduce that number further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| but I don't have specific information for you on that just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| We'll have to see how that plays out in terms of where the allocations will be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| and the restorations will be made and then what impact that will have on the specific individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| who have been in those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| You gave us a fund balance analysis, and you said available after FY2011 budget $550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:34| Could you clarify that for me as to exactly what that money is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| Yeah, my understanding is that after all of the obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| and at this point in time so much of this is its projections and its estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| We haven't closed the current fiscal year yet, so we have to make a projection on what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| We have to make a projection based on the obligations for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| What we believe is that at the end of the day that we'll have over the 3% that we are statutorily required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| to set aside as a reserve, we believe we'll have about $3.5 million left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| That's an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| That's our best projection at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| We have committed $2.95 million in this budget to help balance this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| So we think our sort of best case scenario, I suppose, in terms of our best estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| is that about $550,000 is the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| Now, it's based on a lot of assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| It's based on a lot of estimates, and so that's cutting it awfully close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| We can't budget into that 3%, and so based on the fact that it is based on a lot of projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| and estimates, I think it's prudent for us to commit the $2.95 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| but not go further than that at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| The first thing I want to do is to speak to refresh, again, the comments of Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| that there is a very distinct division between the school board and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:20| School board develops a budget, and county commission comes up with the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| and we then basically are, by court and consent decree, we stay out of your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:35| I really want to say that I appreciate you being here early and often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| and working from $19 million down to wherever we have worked our way down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| The school board, in my estimate, has worked very diligently in recognizing the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| or developing a plan to cover how many dollars are going to come in through all your different streams of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| to cover a budget which you've submitted to us as being balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| That's what we have before us today is a balanced budget, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| The one thing that I would ask you for is that next year you do not schedule Carter and Gibbs to graduate on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:19| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| That's good input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| I will find myself torn between what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| I have a comment here from beside me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| Send my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| My wife does not listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| One other thing that I want to say and also comment to is the same as Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| I have received numerous e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| I have received more e-mails than I can respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| but I want everyone to know that the e-mails that have arrived, I've opened them all and I've read them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| I've taken all the input that's been given to us on the county website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| The one thing that I would ask to the chairman of the commission, Chairman Strickland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| we have right now in front of us the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| We've heard a little bit of the administration's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| and we've really talked at length about the school board budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| We probably have several other independent individual items that fall under other people's budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| but what I would like for us to consider or I would like to ask commission to do at this particular point is to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:39| this section of the budget is presented by the school board and is being balanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| that we accept that portion of the budget and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| Now, I may be out of line at asking that we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| but I think that we need to somehow work our way to the end of a discussion of the school board's particular portion of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6352)|
| 1:46:01| and either return to the administration's or to law enforcement or whatever the other several parts of the budget are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| I'm satisfied with the school board budget as presented, and I would like to see it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| I don't think we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| And I understand that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| But we need to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| If you have questions on someone else's budget, you know, you're free to ask any questions to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| John Troyer, could you come down and help us with some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:54| John, this is about like tax day for you, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| Every day is tax day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Help me with some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Sort of what Dave was talking on, Commissioner Wright and some others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| and I have mentioned that, you know, we're looking at everybody else's budget that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| But before we do anything, I think we and Mr. Chairman, I think we as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| we need to look at our budget for a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| I mean, if you'll help me with some stuff, and, Joe Lee, if you'll chime in too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| there's stuff that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| I just want to ask some questions because, you know, we're trying to be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| trying to be transparent, so I want to make sure that we're doing the right thing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| And you might not be the right person to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| I'm assuming that you would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| What are the major things that we pay for at our budget for county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| Well, you've got number one is your staff and your own salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| And so that's a reduction in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| In essence, commissioners are carrying forward the same salary rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| but there's savings in the budget because you're going from 19 commissioners to 11 commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| and there's savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Let me just ask some of the, and I'm not having questions about the salaries whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| Are we paying for any phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| There is some phone expense in the commission budget, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Who has a phone and who, what do we pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| I think that would be better, Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| She may want to address that or we can get you a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| Do you have a phone, Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Yes, there's a commission phone and there is also the beer board phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| The what phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| I'm talking about, are we paying for a personal cell phone for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| Yes, I have one for the commission office and UK has one for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| You know, I don't, you know, commissioners, I don't know that we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| I mean, that's your all's decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| You know, we've got an answering machine to work there at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| What about paying to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| Jolie, do we pay to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Who pays to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| The commission office staff does not and most of the commissioners do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| Yes, we've asked everybody else to park, and I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| guys, we need to set the example on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| It's not fair for other people's offices out there to be paying to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| and we exclude our office, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| You know, it's a dollar and a quarter a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| Another question, John, this may be Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| These dues that we are, this NACO, Jolie, how much per commissioner do we pay for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:34| do you pay for us on this a year, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| I believe the, I don't have the information in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| but I believe the registration or the dues is right around 4,000 something a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:49| And I think it's based on the size of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| I'm not sure about that, but the National Association of Counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| is that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| You know, maybe, Jolie, come first of what, first of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| if you want to send something around saying who wants to belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| rather than just send money in for us, you know, I don't want to belong to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| You know, guys, by the time you get to county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| if you don't know how to be a commissioner, you know, you're in the wrong business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| So I'd like for the county not to pay for my part of the dues and stuff on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| And if any of the commissioners want to have it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| They can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| But I just think there's some, those are three areas that I think that we can cut right there, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| I just want to propose those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Anybody has any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| I'd like to make a statement to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| John, can you, in the last three years, two years that I know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| the commission budget has dramatically decreased probably by about 40% this year, wouldn't you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| Yeah, it's come way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| The other thing that we've done on the commission is cut the discretionary funds that we've got in our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:51| And that's the funding plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| And, of course, the final decision is the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| It's $500 per commissioner, that's for the 19, and that's for the two-month period for July and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| And then $3,000 for each of the 11 for September 1st and forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| And so that's half of what had previously been allocated to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| So there's a savings there in the discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| And the mayor's discretionary is cut in half likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| And we've also went to the computerized agenda that saved us tens of thousands a year in copy machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:26| maintenance paper, ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| I mean, our budget has drastically been reduced in the last, I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| there's times where Jolie and UK are going to need those phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| I think we're, you're talking about a third of a cent off of, I mean, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:44| I mean, you're just, you're talking about nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| But, you know, Brad, I think that sends the wrong message when everybody else in this courthouse has to pay to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| but we let our people park for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| And we pay for other people's cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| You know, I use my cell phone more than I do for county commission work, more than I do for insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| Nobody pays for my cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| I think you're selling the office straight by saying that it hasn't cut its budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| It's cut its budget by 40 percent in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Oh, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| I think that you're picking on people that have operated efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| And I think that, I just think that there's a time and a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| And we've cut our budget 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| It's going to cut even more drastically with personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| We're going to be doing more with less with one commissioner per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| And we're going to need them more now than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| And I think their job is going to be harder with us going to one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| I don't think we need to handicap them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| Well, I don't think taking away a cell phone when they're in the office from eight to five o'clock is handicapping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| and asking them to pay to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| Her day doesn't end at five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Well, there's an answer machine there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| You know, I just think that we need to be setting the example for the citizens out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| We've asked everybody else to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| It's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| And I don't know if other people are getting their cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| And I'm just trying to find ways to, no nonsense ways to save us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:14| Last year, personally, I cut the commission budget one-third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| I mean, there's been a lot, you know, just because we went to the paperless system, that saved a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| We're going to, you know, our job is where we can cut, we can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| And, you know, I just don't think we're being a good example by saying, well, yeah, we cut this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| But, I mean, that's a gimme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| We know we're going to less commissioners than we've gone to a paperless system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| That's great to be applauded for that and the people that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| But there's still more ways that we can save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| And that's what we're elected for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| We're elected to save tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| It's taxpayers' money that we're saving out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| This is for the administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| The one we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| We're talking about the internal budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Let me, this is, let me digress just momentarily, may I, on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| Up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Because this thing stays sort of open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| I heard what John said and Mr. Arms said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| Will the lobbyist contract be renewed or will it not be renewed on July the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| They go month to month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| They go month to month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| Because that's $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| I know there's some thought about whether we need a lobbyist or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| I've not been overwhelmed by Ferris Matthews necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| But I do think we need it just so we know it's officially going month to month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6888)|

| 1:56:18| I marked the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| I still want to talk about the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| We've strained for the last week or so over $1.7 million to retain teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:33| but we're talking about a capital plan here that's $72 million or $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| I don't know exactly which figure we ought to pull out of this to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| but one of the things that's hiding in here, this is just my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| the $58 million for the school board as it affects school buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7009)|
| 1:57:00| I'm going to bring up a school in the east and a school in the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:08| and for one location we're going to spend $5 million to renovate a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| and we're going to go to the other end of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| and we're going to spend $18 million to build a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| and I have not had the figures explained to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| I know that I've been to a couple of three different places talking about the renovation for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| There's three quarters of a million dollars just in site preparation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| because we have to move a mountain of rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| There's a million and a half to add a gymnasium at the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:47| The remainder of that $5 million is going to renovate Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| There is some talk now that it may not even cover adding the four new classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| The other end of the county, speaking of the $18 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| it may be something that is perfectly and logically feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:12| but just across the county line from Corrington at Paulette,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| an equivalent size elementary school is being built back in the $5.5 and $6 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:27| Now, it's comparing apples and oranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| but I don't think we as commission have looked at the $72 million of the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| and the only reason I bring it up to look at it is because it affects Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| There are lots of things at Carter Elementary that if we looked at them may become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:54| For example, the queue line to get off Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| to the front door of the elementary schools that exist right now is several hundred yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| Several hundred yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| The queue line getting into the new elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| the entrance is on the Asheville Highway side of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| I don't know how long that queue is, but it's not several hundred yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| We just got through dealing with an issue at Ritta School, Ritta Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| where school blocks traffic on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| I got caught in it the first day of school last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| Sat there for 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| It's not been fixed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| Now, there's a plan afoot, but it's in probate court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:44| I just don't want us to end up two or three years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:50| of me being a seated commissioner getting to tell someone, I told you so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:57| because an I told you so two or three years from now will not fix a problem at Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| which will be there for the next 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| If something is done at Carter Elementary School now, that's how long it will be in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:16| There will be no way to go back to that particular location and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| Now, we, Knox County, we own property down the street for an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:31| It's on sewer, by the way, and the sewer system where the Carter Elementary is proposed to be renovated is not on sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:44| I think we're headed down the wrong path if we approve this capital plan without looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:52| A school board guy from the 8th District is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| I hate to bring him to the microphone because I don't know what he'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| I believe there have been comments about commissioners not talking to school board guys, but I've talked to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:07| He's only been appointed for a short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| School board guy before that was mad at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| We will have a new school board guy in a couple, three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| School board itself is undergoing a significant, significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:30| I just don't know personally if it's the right thing to do to put this capital plan under approval this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:46| Having said that, I know you all don't like going to Carter because we went there for Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:56| Midway Road is another instance of trying to get all the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7316)|
| 2:02:03| If you really look at what MPC has told the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| they're saying that their enrollment at Carter is holding steady, modest increases, but it may be declining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:14| I don't know which one of those three I'm supposed to pull out and use whenever I make my vote right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:22| We know at Midway Road there is a proposal of thousands of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| Would that affect the head count at Carter Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| Well, I would suggest that it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| All I'm asking for is 30 days for a commission to look at the proposal that balances the educational needs in East County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:49| and the proposed needs of education in West County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| and try to reach a balance between $5 million being spent at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| of which $1.5 million is a middle school gym and $750,000 in site preparation to remove rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7381)|
| 2:03:14| This does not seem to me like sufficient dollars left to do asbestos abatement, new plumbing, heat and air conditioning, new roofs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:27| all of those things which are supposedly in this plan, including four new classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| which I think may be falling out of the plan and us not having looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| So I move that the capital plan be delayed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| Commissioner Armstrong, you want to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| I'm in support of this substitute motion, and the main reason is we were ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| I have a lot of questions related to the capital plan, especially in the school business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| It seems like everybody around us knows how to build schools at a very cost-effective rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| and at a very good square footage rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| Our neighboring communities are being able to build elementary schools that will serve 750 students for $5.85 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:33| including land prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| These are brick facade buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| They're very nice buildings, full-blown cafeterias, full-blown gymnasium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| high-quality paint jobs with logos and the whole ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| We turn around and we want one for 500 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| It costs us $18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| I don't know whether it's really good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| I mean, I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| I can't say that they're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| I don't know whether we're comparing apples or oranges because I don't really know what we're comparing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| because I don't know what we're doing in Knox County when we're saying $18 million to build a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:07| So I think we need to put this off and get a look at how we're going to build our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| and how we're going to spend our capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| and whether we're really ---- is it necessary for us to spend $3 to 1 compared to other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:21| building the same facilities to serve the same kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| I mean, I know we've had a health department that's looking at the weight of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| but I don't think we're that heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| I mean, our kids are like every other kid's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| and I don't see why our schools have to be three or four times what it costs our neighbors to build a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| Now, if it does, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Maybe we've coded ourselves into a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| or maybe we've made legislative things that the school board and our builders ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:49| maybe we've costed ourselves into oblivion with the legislations that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| Well, maybe we need to look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| because we're really spending a ton of money for the same services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| that other communities are doing at many times one-third the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| So I'm in support of Commissioner Wright's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| Before I get into my comments, I see Dr. McIntyre has returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| And would you like to address any of these issues that have been brought before by Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| Commissioner Armstrong, concerning the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| Sorry, Commissioner, I stepped out to call the school board chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| and tell her she didn't have to come back for the vote because you already voted on it on the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| So if you could bring me up to speed on what the motion is, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| Well, there's a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| And the question is that is $5 million enough for the Carter Elementary expansion renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:55| versus the $18 million that's for the new Southwest Sector Elementary School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| And explain why, I guess, the school board came up with the plan that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:09| I'm glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| It started with this year's capital plan really started more than a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| when in the spring of, I guess it would have been 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| the school board adopted five capital planning conceptual priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:27| And those included a new Southwest Sector Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:33| a major renovation and a new middle school gymnasium at the Carter campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:41| work to Chilhowee Intermediate School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| the potential of a new magnet technology slash STEM high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| and a potential green edition, environmentally friendly edition at Bell Morris Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7669)|
| 2:07:56| In addition to that, we have over the last several years committed funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| for what we call physical plant upgrades, or PPUs as we commonly call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| which are minor to major projects in capital improvements across the entire school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| With regard to the conversation around Carter Elementary and Middle School versus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| I guess I hesitate to say versus a new school in the Southwest Sector of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:26| I think our philosophy and what we've tried to do in terms of the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| really is look at the need and what the needs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| We did consider in the Southwest several different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| What we know in the Southwest is that we will see an increase of about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| we expect to see an increase of about 500 school-aged children in that sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| in the next five to seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| And so there was consideration for a couple different directions to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| one of which was to try to do major renovations in a couple of different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| That was not seen as the best option in that particular area of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| simply because we expect the growth will likely continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| And a new school in that sector allows for more flexibility and longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:14| than does renovating some of the school buildings that were built in the 1930s in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| So on the Carter side, I think a number of challenges have been identified with the Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:29| I think the middle school gymnasium was a major concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:33| that that was not an adequate gymnasium for a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| I think that's been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| The traffic patterns are problematic and challenging in that campus that houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| both the elementary school, the middle school, and the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| The cafeteria was challenging in terms of its setup and the way that it operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7786)|
| 2:09:53| The fact that the main office of the elementary school is on exactly the opposite end of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7793)|
| 2:10:00| than the main entrance to Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| And then the fact that there was additional need for some classroom space at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| So I think the funding that was allocated and the design that was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| is actually quite an elegant design, I think, in terms of what it does to address those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| with a relatively, I think, a very appropriate investment of funds of about $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7818)|
| 2:10:24| It addresses all of those things, including creating a new entrance to Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| which is actually sort of in the side of the current school building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| sort of toward the back where the parking lot area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| It allows for both, I think, a more efficient use of that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| but also addresses some of the safety concerns that were endemic to having the main entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| and the main office at completely opposite sides of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| So I think, again, I've talked to Commissioner Wright since our last conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| and offered to sit down with him and have our staff sit down with him and look at the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| I think it really does address the major needs that have been identified at the Carter campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| and I think it's a substantial investment in making that a modern, up-to-date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7864)|
| 2:11:12| not only safe and healthy, but inviting learning environment at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7872)|
| 2:11:22| I guess the commissioners in the 8th District, I guess I'd like to give you an opportunity to possibly respond to what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| I know your lights aren't on, but those were the questions that both of you had been proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| and I wanted to give you that first opportunity to respond back to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| Not hearing what I had to say a moment ago, the commission heard me talk of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7901)|
| 2:11:48| and concerns that, well, to be blunt about it, are from the recent campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:56| There are lots of people in the Carter community that are concerned about the plan that has been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7916)|
| 2:12:04| and some of those questions I've presented to Doug Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| We talked at length an hour and a half, two hours this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| and I relayed the questions that concern me most that I have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:21| because that's all I can say is that the questions that were asked were asked of me by people out of the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7941)|
| 2:12:30| And what I said a few minutes ago about my concerns do not derail what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:40| What I view needing to happen is that the people in the Carter community be informed, become informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:49| and not depend upon me to be the person that's conduit to get them the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| And I ask that commission wait on the capital plan for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| and address those concerns specifically to the people of the Carter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| just as we've done with Midway Road, and I appreciate people going to Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| or to Carter High School to talk about Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| And I would appreciate commission at this moment giving the 8th District the same courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:21| It's almost like the capital plan was going to be passed before I could get my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:29| So having said that, I don't think that we can impress the people of the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8009)|
| 2:13:38| with the answers to their questions in another half hour discussion here this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| So substitute motions on the floor, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| Mr. Chairman, if I could just add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| I don't want to obviously get involved in the internal workings of your body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| but I will say that I do feel confident that we had a very adequate opportunity for folks in the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8035)|
| 2:14:05| to see the plans, to understand the plans, to comment on the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| at a couple of different board meetings where these issues were discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| The plans were made public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| The plans were discussed at a mid-month meeting, not where the decision was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| but at a mid-month meeting where we invited the public to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| They were then voted on at a separate meeting where we had both a workshop and a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| So we did make sure that we informed the public of what we were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| that we invited comment on that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| and I feel like we did have adequate opportunity for the folks in the 8th District to really understand the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:44| and comment on them prior to the board adopting this capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| which is now before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| I guess I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| I'm not against a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| I just wondered, I don't know if he or anyone is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| how that if that affects any of the processes that might ensue in terms of going forward with proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:19| and bids and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| So that's my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| John, do you think you may be able to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, let me add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| because I had essentially the same question except the next four items on our agenda deal with our bonding and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:33| Is that going to impact that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| No, I'd like to say that I think it would be a healthy discussion to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| to make sure that everybody is comfortable with the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| I feel like it's much more important that we agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| and let the departments know on how much they're going to have on the operating budget and the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| We can take a little more time and be a little more deliberative about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| And we still do want to do Resolution 810,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| but 30 days are certainly we can work with that on the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| And I guess in terms of a comment, I don't want us to be too short-sighted in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:13| and start throwing out examples of how this school was built for $5 million and this one costs $18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8173)|
| 2:16:23| I distinctly remember that dialogue when we were spending a lot of money on our inner city schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:30| namely Fulton and Austin East, and they were a $15, $20 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| And at the same time, I remember Union County building a full school for $6 million or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| And it does, if you drive by, it has great curb appeal, but they've struggled with that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| I dare say five years from now, I don't think we'll be struggling with Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| I think we need to understand that if we're going to be a world-class school system, then we need world-class facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8215)|
| 2:17:04| So I don't want to get caught up in comparing ourselves with a neighboring, especially rural county, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8224)|
| 2:17:12| I think the technology, I think the demands that we put on those schools are higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8232)|
| 2:17:21| I think we demand, you know, from an IT standpoint, from a functionality standpoint, from an energy-saving standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8241)|
| 2:17:28| I think we put a higher standard on our builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:36| So I don't want to get caught up in southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| Now, we can have an independent conversation about what's best for Carter, as we can have about what's best for Chihuly Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:48| which is in my district, and what those renovations are going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| So I'm encouraged by this, but I don't want us to start, you know, that's probably, I won't say bad form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8273)|
| 2:18:03| but it's not the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| I think we need to understand why this school costs $20 million and this school gets a $5 million raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8286)|
| 2:18:14| But in terms of comparing ourselves with others, I really do think it's an apples-to-oranges comparison, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:22| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| If I may, just I think there's a couple of relevant points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| One is there is an impact of delaying the capital budget from our perspective, and there may be multiple impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:35| I'm aware of at least one specific impact, and that is part of this capital plan includes some dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| for the build-out of the Educational Resource Center that we're trying to build at the Simon Mall facility at Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:48| That is on a very tight time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| It requires approval by the Simon Youth Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| and then we're expecting to try to make that construction happen this summer in order to open the Educational Resource Center this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8334)|
| 2:19:03| I think there's a very real impact potentially if this capital budget is delayed for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| in our ability to have that work completed before the opening of school potentially for the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| I think the other part of the conversation that's relevant to Commissioner McKenzie's point is that we have done some analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8354)|
| 2:19:22| around cost per square foot in some of the other school buildings that have been built regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:29| That analysis was presented to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| It was part of the capital budget package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| It is posted on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| We talked about it at some length at two school board meetings, and so we've done some of that analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:45| and I think we do have some very specific program requirements in terms of what we think are necessary to provide a safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:56| healthy, inviting learning environment for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| But I also think that analysis revealed that we're really not that far off in terms of when you do an apples-to-apples comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8400)|
| 2:20:07| as the Commissioner suggests, we're really not that far off on a cost per square foot basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:14| with some of the other facilities that may have been built in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| Commissioner Wright, how do you envision this 30-day delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| Will you be setting up a meeting at Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| Will you be facilitating that, or how will this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| Because obviously we don't want to come back next month, but we need to have some meetings to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| What are your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| I would like to ask the Chairman to establish a public forum, as we did on the Midway Road, in the Carter community sometime during the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:52| And the presentation will be made by school board as it relates to this Carter project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8452)|
| 2:21:01| The thing that I may have made a comment that you may not have heard earlier was the fact that what is said in the 30 minutes here in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:10| does not make it to the ear of the resident in the 8th District in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8470)|
| 2:21:18| They need to be convinced of it on their own terms, on their own turf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| or else we will be fighting a perception problem for the rest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:39| Commissioner Anders, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| Dr. McIntyre, on the new building, the southwest building, is the PVA building that elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| or are we going to do something a little different this time than what we did with Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| The dollars are within the regular capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8510)|
| 2:21:57| so my understanding is that in all likelihood that will be managed by the Knox County Schools Facility Department and probably not PVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| That determination hasn't been made yet, but that would be my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| I think that the concern, the only concern I have over that is that the public perception or truth or perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8528)|
| 2:22:15| neither one, that before you got here and Hardin Valley was constructed, that it wasn't done openly and appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| and I hope that we do that with this next school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| I think it will save a lot of money that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| If it's the other Harmons not here, it must be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| There's only one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| The question I have, you know, this is actually a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| It's not really set in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| Can't these plans be altered during the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| If we say we need to change these plans, they can be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| At least yearly they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| What I'm saying to Dr. McIntyre, if we go ahead and approve this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| I understand you've got a situation that could be critical if we don't move forward with this capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:57| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| And, again, that's one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| There may be other impacts that I'm not aware of in delaying this capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| but I'm very aware of that one particular example that I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| My understanding is that we do have, you know, these are, it is, as you say, a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| And there are, we do have a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| But the board, you know, the board has received that concept and affirmed that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:22| And so we are moving in a direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| But there are always, you know, as we move forward, there are often adjustments or modifications along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| But, you know, they've pretty well adopted a concept for the Carter campus that includes, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:39| renovations to the elementary school, the traffic pattern, the main office at the elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| and a new gymnasium for the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| So if something comes up at Carter that needs to be changed, it can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| They can still have their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| But the plan will go ahead and be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| Am I asking the right question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| Would that be something the law department could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| You can still have your community meeting and address the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| And if there's changes they would need to make, they can make those plans changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| Is that something that can be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| It would be my impression that if we approve the capital plan now as it relates to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:17| then there would be no more input from county commission because we would have appropriated the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:26| and they would be charged with going and spending them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| So we're wanting to change their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| That's how they would like to spend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| So we're going to change it and basically tell them how we want that capital plan to be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| I don't think we can tell them how we want the money spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| I believe we have to discuss it here knowing what their request is and either approve it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:52| And I'm not saying this is a plan that needs to be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| All I'm asking for is that between now and July the 1st, when the capital plan has to be in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8696)|
| 2:25:04| that we take a few days to look at these numbers on Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| and get a presentation from the school board for the people in Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| and that they become aware of the plan and buy into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| Else we will have the perception, as it has always been, that the East County gets little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:26| And I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| So if there is a situation where you have a problem with this plan and we don't approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| that could jeopardize your moving forward in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| Yes, well, at least in the ERC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| I'm told Doug Dillingham, who's our supervisor of facilities, tells me that we are in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| as I mentioned, the board has adopted this capital plan with this concept for the Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| and Carter Middle School and the Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| It is in design phase right now, so it is still being designed from a final perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8756)|
| 2:26:02| So there are opportunities if we identify challenges or issues to make appropriate adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8762)|
| 2:26:09| as we complete the design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| The direct answer to your question is, again, I don't know if there are other examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| I don't know if there are other impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| I am aware of one impact, and that's around the Education Resource Center at the Knoxville Center Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| which I think delaying 30 days could potentially impact our ability to complete that build-out of the space in the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:33| for which there's about $75,000 in this capital plan to fund one-third of that renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:40| It could impact our ability to get that completed before the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| And I would love to be able to open that, and that's our plan, to try to open that for the beginning of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:48| Is it possible that we could pull Carter Campus Renovation Edition plans out and discuss it individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| Is that something that could be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| It may be possible that I would recommend that the school at the mall be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| and the rest of the capital plan be open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:10| Well, we've already had a substitute motion, which was yours, to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:17| And I don't know that we can approve everything but one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| Dr. McIntyre, I do have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| The Carter renovation, normally our capital projects, we look out for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| In what year is the Carter renovation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| Is that year one or two, three, four, five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| That's in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| That's in fiscal year 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| So that would get the ball rolling this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| So nothing would change with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| When you start getting in years two, three, four, five, those aren't set in concrete like year one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| So I just wanted to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Commissioner Brown had just a dying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| I'll yield to Commissioner Brown real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| He acted like he had something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| Well, this may be we're looking at a moot point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| I mean, we know we're going to have so much dollars in the capital funds for them to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:16| Does that preclude them from going ahead with this Knox Center Mall project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| I mean, if we don't approve the full package, then we know we want the Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| And it's going to cost X amount of dollars, which is, say, 20% of the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| So if we cut the total budget by 5%, that means they're going to have to take 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| that other 5% off of some of the other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| So I don't see that that would keep them from going on and doing the Knox Center Mall project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8920)|
| 2:28:51| Would it, Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| Commissioner, I think that my interest would be to try to move that particular project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| I'm told that we also, under the physical plant upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| there are some things that we would like to schedule for this summer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| So there's some renovations that obviously we have limited opportunity to do major renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| and typically it happens during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| And so a 30-day delay could have some impact on our ability to execute some of the planned physical plant upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:24| that are in this budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| So that's another area that I think we have some level of urgency in requesting that those funds be appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:35| as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| Commissioner Smith, you still have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| Superintendent or Doug, whatever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| and I've got the same scenario that what we've got at A.J. Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| You know, we've been out there, that school's been temporary, and that was 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| and it's a wooden structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| And whereas I don't know that we want to hold a community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| you guys are going to be holding a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| But, Dr. McIntyre, you or Doug, if one of you would get with me within the next 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| and let's see where, because I've asked you before, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| where A.J. Burnett is on your radar, and you say, you know, guys, it's not even on our radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| Well, I need something to take back to the citizens and say, here's why it's not on that, if it's still that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9010)|
| 2:30:16| But, you know, we want A.J. Burnett to be built, and we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| that's six superintendents ago that we've been working for at A.J. Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| But I'm also like, I'm a team player, and if these guys are in more need than what I am at A.J. Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| then that's the way it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| And I'm sort of like them, is, you know, guys, if we keep throwing everything west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| everything's going to keep going west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| But, you know, there's great needs all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:41| But, Doug, you or somebody or whoever that needs to get with me within the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| because I need to take something back to my people, say, you know, say they get Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:53| They're going to say, Larry, why don't we get A.J. Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| Well, I want to be able to get sound numbers and good information as to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| But, you know, yeah, we'd like a new A.J. Burnett that's so many portables out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9060)|
| 2:31:05| and it's all wooden structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| We'd like to be counted in that group, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| And, Commissioner, respectfully, that's a conversation I believe we've had a couple times in this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| But we've never given figures and facts as to, you know, you say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| but give me numbers as to why we're doing this here at this place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| and why we're, you know, that's what people want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| They want to see actual hard proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| And we shared with you, I believe, the report of the structural engineer who looked at A.J. Burnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| and who told us that it was an adequate and appropriate educational environment for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9096)|
| 2:31:42| that it did not need to be replaced, despite the moniker that's been put on it as temporary for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9102)|
| 2:31:48| that it was constructed in a way that meets our standards in terms of an educational facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9108)|
| 2:31:55| and that it will last probably as long as many of our other structures that were built as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| quote, unquote, permanent structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| So I will be glad to share that report with you again, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| Enrollment figures, you know, what's it been over the last 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| Let's look at the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| Is it up, down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| Is it starting to go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| Let's just see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| But, yeah, I mean, the figures are what they are, so I'll work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=9140)|

| 2:51:22| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10282)|
| 2:51:23| I want to ask John a couple of quick things about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10283)|
| 2:51:26| I want to ask him about 807, 8, 9, and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| Just explain, John, if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| You've got 807 is initial resolution for $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| 808 is a resolution for $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| 809 is a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| Is 809 withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10304)|
| 2:51:45| Withdrawn, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10305)|
| 2:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| It takes both resolutions to do the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10308)|
| 2:51:51| And so 807 is coupled with 808.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| And those two go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10314)|
| 2:51:55| We have initial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10315)|
| 2:51:56| I call them initial and final resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| But 810 is 40.6 by itself, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:04| And that's just refunding existing debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| That's a refunding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| So the 807, 808 is new money, but it's just one instance of $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| It takes both resolutions to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| 809 is just refunding existing debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| Is all of the 17 going to be Build America bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| Yeah, that's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| Will they be just so, you know, you and I talked about this a year ago, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10346)|
| 2:52:31| Will they be the kind where the interest rate is comparable to the corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10351)|
| 2:52:37| and then the federal government pays the difference or will there be the tax credit stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| It's the kind where the federal government pays the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10365)|
| 2:52:46| So we would have net interest after the federal government gives us rebates, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10366)|
| 2:52:54| And, okay, no insurance, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10374)|
| 2:52:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10379)|
| 2:53:00| Do we do that anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| Have you done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| I don't remember the last time we used it, but we're not planning to, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:08| You only do it if you can get AAA or only when AAA is Berkshire Hathaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| Is that right, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10392)|
| 2:53:13| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10393)|
| 2:53:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10394)|
| 2:53:15| So for us, it doesn't make economic sense in this market, so we're not proposing that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10395)|
| 2:53:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10401)|
| 2:53:22| And that's, you feel comfortable with 17 million as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| I just read some stuff over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| New Jersey wanted to go out with 250 million and build America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| It was so oversubscribed, they sold 1.3 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| Just they were so, I mean, so there's no arbitrage or anything, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10415)|
| 2:53:39| There can't be that, can there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| No, he's shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10422)|
| 2:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| I'll trust you on the 17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| It's just one instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| And just reading the resolutions, you wouldn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| And what is the term on these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| Do you mean two to 30 years or two to 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10433)|
| 2:53:57| We'll do 20-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100524part1?start=10440)|
