| 0:00:00| if all the commissioners would take their seats please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| I'd like to call to order this special call meeting by the Knox County Mayor of the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=30)|
| 0:00:56| County Commission. We have three items to consider today. Clerk, would you call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| roll please? Commissioner McKenzie, here. Commissioner Broyles, here. Commissioner Norman, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=59)|
| 0:01:06| Commissioner Briggs, here. Commissioner Anders, here. Commissioner Smith, here. Commissioner Wright, here. Commissioner Brown, here. Commissioner Hammond, here. Commissioner Schell, here. All eleven members are present. Before we begin with item number one, I'd like to call on the Knox County Law Director to explain the procedures that we'll be operating under here today. These are parliamentary procedures. Mr. Law Director. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=66)|
| 0:01:28| commission, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you an agenda that has three items and the agenda is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| restricted to those three items. Just a word on parliamentary procedure if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| As the commission's aware, you do have commission rules that you abide by during the course and conduct of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| meetings. However, the commission rules do defer to Roberts Rules of Order in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| certain circumstances, especially in the manner in which certain motions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| made. Robert's Rules is about a 705-page tome, and I'll try to condense it for you just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| One of the biggest issues we normally have that have not really been problematic is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| making of motions. When you make a motion to amend, you should distinguish that between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| a substitute motion and a motion to amend. For instance, if a commissioner makes a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| to approve the budget as written, if you're going to make a substitute motion, what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| saying is I'm going to basically replace that which is before the commission with an entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| new budget. The better motion may be a motion to amend that budget because you're only amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| a certain portion of it. So that's kind of the distinction between a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| substituting the entire entity as compared to amending it. Now, your rules do provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| for a friendly amendment to an amendment. That's called an amendment of the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| degree, but it ends there. In other words, you can't do an amendment to an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| to an amendment. Now, let's say, for instance, a commissioner makes a motion to amend, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| is seconded, it's debated, and that motion fails. Even though you go back to the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| motion, a subsequent commissioner could make a motion to likewise amend as long as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| not a mirror image of that first motion. So in other words, if a commissioner does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| a motion to amend the budget to say add monies to a certain project and that is defeated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| another commissioner could make a motion to amend the budget to add monies perhaps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| a different entity, but not the same one that's repeated. Finally, the issue of calling the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| question. To call the question is a parliamentary rule that essentially ceases debate. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| way that would work, that means a commissioner wants to stop debate and vote on the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| pending before it. To call the question, a commissioner will say, I make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| call the question. That requires a second. And once the chairman is comfortable there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| a motion and a second, there is then a vote. That requires a two-thirds vote, not a simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| majority like everything else before you. And two-thirds of 11 is 7 in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| Are there any questions about your rules of procedure? If they do evolve during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| meeting, I'm available of course. Thank you, Mr. Law Director. I know that all commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| are aware of this, but we are here obviously to do the people's business. I know that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| will do it in such a way that it will reflect proper decorum and civility that our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| expect from us. We are here today to pass a budget that reflects the monies that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| citizens have sent to operate their government. And so as we begin, let's start with item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| number one, clerk. Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| establishing a general county budget and making appropriations from the several funds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| the departments, institutions, offices and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2012 and approving the organizational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| chart of the executive branch of Knox County government. This is resolution 101-SS. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| we have a motion, Commissioner Wright? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| as presented for Knox County be approved. Is there a second? Second. The motion has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| been made and seconded. Commissioner Burwells? I would like to make an amendment. And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| given an amendment to everyone. I also had it posted on the forum two days ago along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| with some position papers. I don't know how many of you had an opportunity to read those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| You might have started reading them and then just drifted off to sleep. But they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| So do I need to read all of this into the record? Mr. Law Director, do we need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| verbally put into the record? Yes. The Commission needs to know exactly what this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| is. And also the funding stream with it as well, Commissioner Burwells. Question. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| Would that list be voted on individually or as a whole or a whole first and if it's defeated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| individually? Mr. Law Director? This is not an amendment. This is a set of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=372)|
| 0:06:28| I think in the interest of clarity and to ensure that, you know, essentially you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| multiple amendments to the budget. And I think the only clean way you can do this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=394)|
| 0:06:44| each individual amendment. Okay. So then should we start at the top? However you'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=404)|
| 0:06:53| begin. All right. So my amendment is... If I could interrupt you, Commissioner, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| you would want to do is state as your first amendment, I make a motion to amend the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| and then read your first one, see if you get a second. And then if the Chair is agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| to that, to continue down your list. Okay. Question. Mr. Law Director, you had said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| I want to get a little clarity in that. If there's a substantial difference in an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| that, say, take for instance Commissioner Brawl's introduces and it's voted down, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| one value coming from one revenue stream and then there's a subsequent amendment, a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| value coming from a different revenue stream. Can that one be introduced? Yes. It's a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| of you can't have a mirror image. So let's say just a round number. A commissioner says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| I make a motion to give $1,000 to XYZ. It's defeated. A commissioner can bring that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=469)|
| 0:07:57| up, but it would have to be a different figure. Okay. Well, I'll tell you what. In the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| of simplicity, I'm going to withdraw my amendment and let the other commissioners go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| And then I'll back clean up. Commissioner McKenzie. Okay. I'm going to withdraw my amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I guess I'm going to do these one at a time, but I'd like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| my revenue stream initially. And all of the items that I'm going to, and you have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| before you and they were sent out via e-mail, all the items 1 through 7 minus 6, 6 will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| come up at agenda item number 3, and that would, or agenda item number 4, that I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=522)|
| 0:08:55| talking about, and I want to be clear, I'm not talking about cutting the budget of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| engineering public works department. What I'm talking about is keeping that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| at the same level of funding that they were at last year. Every other department that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| reports directly to the mayor took a cut. And so what I'm asking is that these extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| funds, which, and please, Mr. Vanderveet, come and correct me if I'm in error. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| he said on our first budget hearing meetings that they did not ask for these funds. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| their initial request, they did not have this extra $364,000 in the initial request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=575)|
| 0:09:45| And so I'm not asking for anything that the engineering department did not ask for initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| Mr. Vanderveet is coming forward maybe to give some clarity. But what I'm asking is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| to keep, I'm not asking to cut the engineering department at all. I'm asking to keep those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| levels, that funding level, at its 2011 levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=602)|
| 0:10:10| Commissioner McKenzie, if I could, just for the sake of clarity, the one place specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| that I was referring to is the account that's known as construction heavy maintenance. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| that's where those additional funds were placed. And they were placed there for the express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| purpose of increasing the number of road miles that we can resurface in the upcoming fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| year. In terms of our overall budget in engineering and public works, we are just like every other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| department. We cut a number of positions, I think a total of four full-time positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| that were vacant. We didn't lay anybody off, but we did eliminate vacant positions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| we trimmed the number of accounts. So we did not globally go up. We did have that one account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| that was increased for road resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Okay. So that was the only thing that I said that may have been a little unclear in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Okay. Thanks. So again, I just want to be clear that the one I'm asking for are additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| funds the engineering department did not initially request for these road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| So with that said, and I'm going to add to number one, and I want people to hear what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| I'm saying clearly, and please listen to what I'm saying, because it's what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| I would like to add, I'm making an amendment to add $138,000 to the Beck Cultural Exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| Center. There's a caveat on that, and I've not discussed this caveat with anyone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| the Beck folks or anyone else. And the caveat is I recognize there are questions. I recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| there's some outcry in the public over the IRS 990 form. I recognize that there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| misunderstandings about how centers like this should operate and how they get to financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| solvency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| So we all, I don't think anyone has said that there should not be an audit of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=722)|
| 0:12:11| funds given to Beck. I feel that that is significant enough to what I'm asking for in this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=731)|
| 0:12:19| is that we authorize payment of the $12,000, and at the end of the audit, and we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| have an external auditor come in, because really the county were paying parts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| bills all the way up until a few months ago, and Beck was paying part of it. So the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| were kind of co-mingled in each person's count and divvied out that way, that both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| processes are audited, and if we don't have, if it comes back without substantial, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| I say substantial, I mean there's not an I-dotted or a signature block here. Those minor things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| I'm not talking about. Every audit is going to find something. But substantial deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| in the way those funds were spent, if it comes back clean, then we will authorize the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| $138,000. I think that addresses, it puts Beck on notice that we're going to get a good audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=786)|
| 0:13:16| we're going to get an independent audit, and we need to understand what's going on. But it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| says that we understand that, yes, we spent a bunch of money on Beck, and that's exactly why, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| it's a great institution, a great entity that should be preserved. So I think at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| both sides are a little uneasy about this. I think we probably struck a good place. And so that is my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| first amendment. We have an amendment on the floor to eliminate $364,000 from the traffic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| engineering budget, with $138,000 being allocated to the Beck Cultural Center after an audit has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| performed, with $12,000 to go ahead and be spent, which is already budgeted. So is there a second to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| that? I have a question for Sam. I need a second. Okay, then I'll second it so we can have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=836)|
| 0:14:05| Okay, there is a second. Commissioner Anders. Sam, is that $360,000, that has nothing to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Alice Road? Alice Drive? No, no, nothing at all. That's in the five-year, and I'll look to Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| Again, that's in the five-year capital improvement plan, right? Agenda item number four. Am I correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| in that? The monies for outlets limited is $2.8 million, and it is to be considered in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=862)|
| 0:14:32| This is not. It's already been appropriated. Yes. Commissioner Burroughs. Yes. Before we start voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=872)|
| 0:14:42| amendments, I think it would be most beneficial to us to allow the public to speak and to give their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| before we actually vote on anything. So can we go ahead and do that before? We have some people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=888)|
| 0:14:58| signed up to speak. I'm not sure who. The chair is going to rule that you will have three minutes. I will let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| you know after two minutes, because we do have a lot to discuss today, and I believe you can make your point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| that time. This is the chair's prerogative. I want to make a substitute motion. Yes. That the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| voice their opinions, ask questions first, because this is a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Well, we have a there's a motion. There was a main motion. Then there was a motion to amend. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=922)|
| 0:15:34| Broyles is not really making a motion. I mean, the only voting motion before you is whether or not to allocate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| funds. She's just asking as a matter of courtesy if people can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| It has been our custom that when we have an item that the public would like to speak on, we've allowed them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| And so unless the commission wants to. I realize that, but I think it should be the prerogative of the commission to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| able to speak first. Yeah, that's fine. We can ask questions and discuss, but before we actually vote on this that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| affects the center, then I think the people who are here to speak for it should be able to speak before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| Well, we heard five hours. I don't know how much you had last Monday, because I wasn't on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| But we've already had five hours on why we should give money to Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| I don't see any lights on. Anybody that wants to ask any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| I have Albert Baugh and Jamie Dobbs signed up to speak on this issue. Are they here? Would they like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| If so, please come forward. You will have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=991)|
| 0:16:41| Hi, my name is Jamie Dobbs. I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1001)|
| 0:16:50| I'm the president of League of Women Voters, and I'm representing our 108 member county constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1010)|
| 0:16:59| And I think we can all agree that the reason for being of county government is to provide service and protection to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| citizens of Knox County that promote their health, safety, and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| The mission of the League of Women Voters is to continually elevate this image of good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| And I'm here today to urge your attention to your mission and to several issues that fall under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| We remind you that as the legislative branch, you represent one of the checks and balances on the executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| in local government, and it's your responsibility to provide good oversight on this budget and represent the greater good of all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1052)|
| 0:17:41| I have just four items. Based on our member-approved land use position, the League urges you to maintain a professional planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1061)|
| 0:17:49| and organization and funding. If you approve the level of cutbacks in the proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| the MPC staff will no longer be able to provide the professional quality services needed of a growing, urbanizing city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| We call on you to support the highest level of funding possible to ensure our future development doesn't suffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| and that the best interest of all citizens is not sacrificed to private interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| Second, based on our study of the homeless housing policies, we call on you to maintain the case management and other services serving the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| Third, based on our social policy policies and one called Meeting Basic Human Needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1099)|
| 0:18:28| we call on you to maintain senior transportation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| And lastly, based on our natural resources and waste management position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| we call on you to restore the IM's recycling program budget and contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you, Mr. Baugh. Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| Albert Baugh, 1536 Cliffside Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| I'm a resident of Houston Hills, and I'm here to voice my opinion on the Beck Cultural Center situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| I also feel that this is a difficult period for county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| and that we all have to tighten our belts and do the best we can for the good of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| not for a selected set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| And so whatever the county commission does, I feel that it's your obligation to do what is in the best interest for the whole community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| not for a special group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| I like Beck. I wish to see it function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| but I also feel that there should be checks and balances with the Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| There should be accountability with that center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| We have the libraries, and the libraries do a very good job for our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| So I will ask the commission to listen to the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| and try and see what we can do for the general good of the community, not just for the Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| This is what I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you, sir. I see no other lights. We will be voting on these. Each will have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| The amendment on the floor is to take $364,000 from the traffic and engineering budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| and $12,000 restored to Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| The $12,000 is really not a part of this because it's money that's already budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| Clerk roll call. We'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Commissioner McKenzie. Aye. Commissioner McKenzie votes aye. Commissioner Broyles. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Commissioner Broyles votes aye. Commissioner Norman. No. Commissioner Norman votes no. Commissioner Ornby. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Commissioner Ornby votes no. Commissioner Anders. No. Commissioner Anders votes no. Commissioner Smith. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| Commissioner Smith votes no. Commissioner Wright. No. Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| Commissioner Brown. No. Commissioner Brown votes no. Commissioner Hammond. No. Commissioner Hammond votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Commissioner Shouse. No. Commissioner Shouse votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| We have nine noes, two ayes, the amendment fails. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| I'd like to make an amendment to reinstate $50,000 to the CAT senior riders' right-free program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1289)|
| 0:21:53| This would come from the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| No, from the same source. The paving budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| I have a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| How many people does that serve, the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| I would say I don't have a number for you, but I would say that our, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| I've got the numbers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| It began in 2006, and since that time it equates to between 8,000 and 10,000 rides per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1347)|
| 0:22:37| What would it cost for a senior, for a monthly pass for a senior if this went away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| I believe the senior passes, the standard senior passes are $30 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| I believe. I'm not entirely sure about that because I don't have a monthly pass anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| Is there someone here from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| Oh, you don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| I think it would, I think the senior rides for 75 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| and it would roughly equate to what you're saying, 8 to 12,000, that's 100,000 a year more or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| so 75 cents is what a senior rides for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| So 100,000 seniors riding is $75,000, $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| So the normal fare is $1.50 one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| The senior fare is 75 cents one way, so it's still $1.50 round trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| And I know that out in your districts the seniors don't ride the bus because there aren't bus routes out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| but in the central county districts where there are the senior subsidized high-rise apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1422)|
| 0:23:54| those seniors ride the bus to the doctor, to the pharmacy, to church, to the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| to visit relatives, to visit friends, to go to the senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| And if a lot of them, by virtue of the fact that they're low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| living in these subsidized high-rises, some of them live on as little as $200 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| Is this, Mr. Law Director, correct me, is this something we can table until, because I think it's a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1457)|
| 0:24:26| It's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| But I want to see what the rest of how the budget plays out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Is it okay to table it until the end of the amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| Well, at this point you have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| The only way you can do that is if the maker of the motion withdraws the motion, withdraws a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| and then it can be raised again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| But beyond that, that's the only procedural way you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| I guess I struggle with that in that I agree that this is a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| This is a much needed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| In terms of the fact that the seniors, you know, and we're not talking about seniors getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| these people are riding the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| They didn't invest in 401Ks for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| I'm generalizing, but I'm pretty accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| I think I could throw an 80% blanket over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| They don't have defined benefit programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| They're not our mothers and our fathers up here on this panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| These are people that are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| And this would be maybe not a financial hit for us and our parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| but this program allows people to balance a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| And when I say balance a budget, it means the cost of going to the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| the cost of going to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| This helps balance their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| So I really think this stands on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| And I think we need to evaluate it based on the fact that it's a sorely needed program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| to a segment of our community that is not able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| a lot of times not able to pass the driver's test to get a car, to own a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| You know, they have to give up their assets oftentimes to be able to stay in the facilities that they're staying in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| So I feel that this is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| It's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Yeah, I just had a question, and Amy had some statistics on the number of rides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| but it doesn't tell us how many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| And I don't know if we know that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Well, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Some people may have three or four rides a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Well, probably, I don't know, per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| I don't know if you've ridden the bus lately, but it's not really quick in terms of getting somewhere and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| But 8,000, 10,000 rides on cap per month, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| I'm sure that the majority of those riders are riding more than once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| I wouldn't say that they're riding three or four times a day, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Maybe three times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| I just didn't have any idea how many people we were serving with this is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| So I guess we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| In terms of obviously I support this program, I want to see it funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| not just because I think it's entirely the wrong thing to balance a budget on the backs of our elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| but because there is a huge discrepancy between the amount of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| The things that affect the central county districts, either they are located there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| or they serve the people primarily in that area, have almost all been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| But at the same time, we're increasing our spending in the outer districts, the outer county districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| And I think that's something that we as commissioners, particularly our at-large commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| need to take a serious look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| and make sure that all of the county's resources are being allocated in an equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| and fair manner across the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| So obviously I support this for multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| The only issue I have with it is where we're going to fund it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| I'm willing to second it so that we can have some discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| but I personally would prefer to take the money from a different place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| because even though the repaving of roads, I mean, we're down to, I think, 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| resurfacing 12 miles of road a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| which is ludicrous when you think about the total number of miles that the county is responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| But not a single inch of that road resides in the central county districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| So all of that is being spent outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| And, Brad, don't give me the look because we pay taxes too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| You do pay taxes, but the city takes over your roads and all of your roads are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| So I think we need to understand that the county is not responsible for your roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| But county residents come in and ride on city roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Absolutely. That's not the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| But you can't say that there's no county paving in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| when the county doesn't control any roads in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| You need to be truthful and not throw out rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| That's exactly my point, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| That's exactly my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| There isn't an inch of roads in the center county that the county is responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| But yet the taxpayers who live in the central county districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| are helping to pay for the paving outside the county, the central county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| I'm not arguing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| And I don't begrudge those residents in the outer districts a single penny of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| because I know how desperately it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| My point is that there have been disproportionate cuts to the central county district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| while we're increasing spending in the outer county districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| And I think that we need to be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| So what I'm saying is that I don't want to take money from repaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| I know how important it is, and I don't begrudge a penny of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| I think that there's a better place that we can get this money from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| First off, anybody who's in the county that comes into the city to shop pays taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| of which a portion of that goes to fix your city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| But just you talk about figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| We've got 400,000 people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| If they took one trip a day, which we know there's a whole lot bigger average than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| times 300 days a year, that's 12 million trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| That's not including the two or 300,000 more visitors and tourists that come through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| to add another probably eight to 10 million trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| On these county roads that haven't been able to be fixed in the last three years because we haven't had the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| the last thing I would do would be take money from this roads because I know what I've got in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| And I'm agreeing with you on that, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Motion on the floor, which has been seconded, is to restore $50,000 to the CAT Senior Ride Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| with those funds being taken from the paving budget, which would be from traffic and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| If this is defeated, and going along with what Brad asked earlier, a way to table it, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1902)|
| 0:31:54| how can it be brought back up in a different form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Yeah, my question was going to be if it changes the funding source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| is that enough change to bring it up again if it's voted down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Well, I mean, you know, the commissioner can conceivably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| if this is something that the commission wants this process to continue to evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| you can conceivably make a motion to lay this on the table until further into your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| provided you don't actually get beyond the voting of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| But that would take a motion, a second, and a majority vote to lay it on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| Well, that's my point exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| I mean, there may be out of this long list of three or four pages out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| three or four things that I want, would like to see put back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| But to take them now versus later when I might want to do something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| we need to be able to go through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| And anything that has merit that's failed, we need to be able to come back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| I can make a substitute motion to table it until the end of our budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| It would just be a motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| It wouldn't be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| A motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| So we have a motion on the floor, an amendment to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| So what is the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Well, the motion would be to lay your motion on the table until further into the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| When your motion comes back up, it will come back in its same form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| By tabling it, now you're back to the original motion of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| and entertaining any subsequent amendments to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Was there a second to tabling the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Do we need a roll call on this, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Well, you'll just want to make sure you have a majority to table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| If not, then you'll have to vote on the underlying motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| So the motion is to basically lay it on the table for discussion in a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Commissioner McKenzie votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Commissioner Broyles votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Commissioner Norman votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2039)|

| 0:34:02| Commissioner Ombi votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2043)|

| 0:34:05| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Commissioner Anders votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Commissioner Brown votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Commissioner Hammond votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Commissioner Schell votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| So we're back to the amendment, which is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Can you vote to table a member's motion, or does that motion have to be withdrawn or tabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| by the person who offered it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Our rules do not require the maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Any member can table it for subsequent discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| So we're now back to the original motion, $50,000 reinstated to the CAT Senior Writers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| From paving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| So just for clarification, what we just did was proper in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| So we're now back to the motion of restoring $50,000 with the money coming from the paving budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| Yes, because the motion to table failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| So do we want some variety and start in the 11th district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| We'll do this so we don't pick on the first one all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I'd be happy to start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Let's do a roll call and start with the 11th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Commissioner Schell votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2124)|

| 0:36:04| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| You know, at this point, I think it's obvious I don't have any support on several aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2171)|
| 0:36:21| I guess I have some support on some of the items, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| But I don't have any support from whence we shall take the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| But let me say, this isn't a city versus county thing, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| I do agree with Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| What she did was state a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| She actually said she agrees with keeping the monies here, but she stated a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| It is a fact that the county doesn't pay city roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| It's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| It's a fact that the city runs the airport and we don't give any money to the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| They're facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| So don't, I would hate if we start arguing facts because of the way they sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| Facts are facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| And so, but again, this wasn't a city commissioner trying to take funds from county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2225)|
| 0:37:15| That's not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| The engineering department did not ask for these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| They did not ask for these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| They did not ask for these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| So the only thing I'm trying to do is to put their funding back to what they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2250)|
| 0:37:39| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| And they would end up with this $364, according to Mr. Vandervate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| they would end up with additional funds because they had made some cuts in the balance of their department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| So, again, let's not confuse politics with facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| The facts are the engineering department was asked to submit a budget that did not cover these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| With that said, I know that I'm not going to get any support from this commission at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| on pulling the funds from this fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| So I will turn my light off at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| The caveat for me for voting no on that was, again, from taking it from the paving funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| The email that we all got from Jamie Dobbs earlier had one sentence in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| and I can't quote it directly, but basically what it said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| we have the responsibility to take care of those that can't take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| Pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Anything above that, if you're able to take care of yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| then you ought to be taking care of yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| So I'm not averse to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| I just don't want to take it from that kind of funds because, as I said, all those people driving those roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| and, again, Mr. McKenzie, I will say that every dime that any of us spends here in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| part of that goes to pave some of those city roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| So it's kind of like tit for tat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| I guess on the email, if we're going by the memo from Joe Lee, I guess I'm next since Sam stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| I had put out, I had talked about in the last meeting about the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| and the funding for that and funding a 2% pay raise for the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| And I still believe that county employees deserve a minimum of 2% pay raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| but I do not, looking at the long-term implications of what that would mean to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2386)|
| 0:39:56| and the Great Schools Partnership and the county budget overall, I think it would have a long-term negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| And for a short-term fix, it's not a good thing to do on a money management wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| Now, there are some things that we need to talk about with Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| because there's some, you know, it's probably not a good resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| or a good statement to make about the Great Schools Partnership that I made last couple of weeks ago money wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2420)|
| 0:40:27| But it certainly did start some conversation that we're going to have that's going to be vetted in meetings with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| and some of the Great Schools Partnership people because there's still some questions to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| You know, and we were told that it would become self-sufficient and there needs to be a plan for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| or there needs to be a reconsideration of their goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| So we're going to have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| But sadly, with the draw, using the 2.6 for the employees that do not get a raise, I think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2452)|
| 0:41:03| I just think it has a long-term negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| But I think it did start a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| In regards to the travel pay, I think we still need to consider, talk to John Troy a little bit about the travel pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| and some people in his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| I've made a statement to make it part of the salary because, I mean, essentially that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| But they had a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| If we left it as travel pay, it doesn't affect the budget as much if we leave it as travel and expense pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| because it does, if we leave it as employment or salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| it becomes where they have to match the benefits on it and that's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| So my motion is to, on this line, is to leave our travel pay as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2501)|
| 0:41:52| And I believe out of the general fund, is that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| My motion is to reinstate our travel pay as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| John, there's, it's not, I just wanted to be certain that it's not eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| You haven't proposed eliminating it, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| You've proposed another mechanism and we would, commissioners would fill out expense forms and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Currently, the way that commissioners are paid are $300 a month and that's a flat rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| What was proposed by the mayor was a reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| The current cost is about $45,000 to reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Our expectations was $20,000, but we didn't know because we haven't been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| But so the difference, I think, is what Commissioner Anders is proposing is to reinstate the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| and reclassify the reimbursement rate to the travel pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| And we can take the money from the food budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| That's the exact amount from the food budget for up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| So I didn't know we had that $25,000 food budget anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| Well, let me do a caveat to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| And that was me that was kind of floating that number because I had seen an allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| but it is not in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| So I need to apologize that that number is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| If I'm speaking out of context, John, I think the general fund can absorb it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| Is that what you're saying in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I mean, we said general fund allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Well, first of all, we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| I just want to make certain that what you're proposing, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| is that it's an automatic thing that we don't have to turn in forms every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| that we're going to have to pay somebody to tally up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| It remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| It remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| I just wanted to follow up with, I ran just a diary of my mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| I, of course, have met large, as you are, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| And I assume we're using 51 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Is that right, John, the federal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I would personally, in all likelihood, exceed that 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| But I frankly don't want to do the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| So I think this is, I can support Brad's amendment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| It's got to cost something for somebody to go through the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and analyze it and print checks or run the deposit through ACH and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| So I think it's a good item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| I did run a tally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| And the county is saving money by leaving it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2673)|

| 0:45:06| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Commissioner Brown votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Commissioner Hammond votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Commissioner Schaaf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Commissioner Schaaf votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| The vote is nine yes, two no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| That amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| If I could, Mr. Chairman, just in terms of I imagine there will be more of all the questions on parliamentary procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| but in the current order of Robert's Rules that we follow regarding motions to lay on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2725)|
| 0:45:33| it reads that the motion to lay on the table enables the Assembly to lay the pending motion aside temporarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| when something else of immediate urgency has arisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| It takes precedence over all subsidiary motions and can be applied to main motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| hence the reason you were able to table that temporarily, regardless of the fact that it didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| Are there other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| I would like to make an amendment that we grant all general county employees a one-step pay increase at a cost of $2,756,479| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2764)|
| 0:46:20| and that the funds come out of the $5 million in the operating budget that the mayor has suggested that we pay down the debt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2780)|
| 0:46:39| There's a motion that a one-step pay increase be granted Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| with the money coming from the funds allocated to debt service, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| I want to be clear, this doesn't come out of the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| This is actually we're not even taking the whole $5 million, we're taking a little over $2.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| and it's out of the $5 million that has been pulled out of operating expense budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| I'd like to, John Troyer, can you explain, is this or the mayor, either one, we have $5 million extra just laying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2834)|
| 0:47:25| No, it's set to go toward our debt payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Is this scheduled payments or is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Tim Burchett, county mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| That is part of our scheduled debt payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| If we were to deviate from that, I believe it would have a negative impact on our bond rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| and it's the commitment that Knox County has made to these lending agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| So I think it would have a detrimental effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Just for my own information, I think I understand this, but so everyone else understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| it's sort of like paying your mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Is that when we have debt, the debt is going to be paid off on a given bond, let's say, over a given number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| Part of your payment is for the interest and part of the payment is to pay down, part of the payment is principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| And what it is, this is an obligation that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| And what we're saying is that we'll pay the interest, but we're not going to be paying any principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| And that is part of the whole schedule that you use to pay down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Just to be sure that everyone out there understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| Because it's not money that you set aside saying we're going to pay extra to pay down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| This is just really it's part of the structure that we have to pay interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| and pay down the principal that we're obligated to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Maybe it's to the mayor or John, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Have we changed the structure and the payoff period since last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2932)|
| 0:49:00| Well, we just have not incurred more debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| I guess my question, okay, well, what do we pay on our debt FY2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| Yeah, there is an increase in the debt service fund for the payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| And that increase in our payments is $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| but that's all according to schedule and not a voluntary payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Well, I guess my question has been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| You know, if this was, to me, if this was new money that we're allocating toward debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| I think it would be on the table for a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| But I think if it's scheduled money, I don't see how we could not pay our mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| And so I'm hoping that, I was hoping that it was new money and it would be on the table, but I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Yes, Mr. Mayor, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| Who are our bond rating companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| No, I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| Moody's and Standard & Poor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Well, I wasn't asking Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| I know that Mr. Troyer knew I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| And when was the last time that you met with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| No, not when was the last time Mr. Troyer met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| When was the last time that you met with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| I'm going to get you the answer if you'll just be patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3024)|
| 0:50:36| That was in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Okay, so you yourself haven't met with them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| But I do have a letter that was, has that been issued to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| Is that in their packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Actually, that was from our recent dealings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| And if we could pass these around, if I could get somebody to Troyer if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3053)|
| 0:51:02| And that outlines some of the positive things that they, and this was unsolicited from the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3062)|
| 0:51:12| that they stated that basically they were very positive towards what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3072)|
| 0:51:20| I believe the letter speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| But this isn't from our bond rating company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| This is from BB&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| But that is who we get our, yeah, we get our letter of credit from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| But they're not the ones who said our credit rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| Okay, let me come at this from a different angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| And as far as the reference to the mortgage, and that's correct up to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3102)|
| 0:51:56| You know, my husband, extra, we're paying more on our debt this year than we paid last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| So our debt schedule and debt payments, you know, I hear that they haven't changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| but then, well, actually we're paying more this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| You know, my husband and I try to pay extra on our principal whenever we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| because we like to save on interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| We like the idea that our house is going to be paid off early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| But we still keep up with our regular monthly payments that we have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| and those are to principal and to interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| And you can look at our county debt in exactly the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| And it's a worthy goal to pay down more on the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| but my husband and I would never let our children go barefoot so that we could put an extra payment on the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| So even if we take out this little bit to give the employees a pay raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| to give them some shoes that they desperately need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| we're still making the payments that we need to make on the principal and the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| And, in fact, I spent quite a while this morning on the phone with Joe Ayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| who is our bond advisor for the company Morgan Keegan that does our underwriting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3185)|
| 0:53:12| And I spent some time on the phone with him, and I asked him some specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| and some of them are about how does Moody's and Standard & Poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| how do they evaluate our credit and our bond rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| And there are dozens of things that they look at, not just how much we pay on our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3210)|
| 0:53:41| They look at the size of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| They look at the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| They look at how much we fund education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| They look at what we have to show for the debt that we've incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| And they also look at the rate of our debt as it relates to assessed value per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| So when we were getting down to the end of our conversation, I asked him, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| if we needed to take $3 million to do something like this, then would it be, which would be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3249)|
| 0:54:19| to take it out of reserves or to take it out of a debt payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| And what he said was, and this is word for word, the response, the size of your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3265)|
| 0:54:33| and looking at your debt, you could take it from either place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| and there would be no effect on your bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3276)|
| 0:54:51| So I'm happy to take it either place because our bond advisor has advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| that this will have no effect on our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| So either place is okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| I suggested we take it out of this debt payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| And also I'd like to say that during the, you know, I've gone back three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| and watched the mayor's budget address for May 2nd because I wasn't able to be here that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| But they have it in archives on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| And I've watched it three times and listened to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| And one of the things that you are so proud of when you present your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| is making extra payments onto the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| You know, we're going to make $20 million every year for five years to pay down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| And I applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Is there anything inaccurate in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| No. I think that's a great plan when we can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| but I don't think we need to let our kids go barefoot while we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| That's the problem that I have with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| The other concern that I, well, the other point that I want to make is that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| that's $20 million that we're paying down on the debt this year, and I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| The thing is, we're talking about a little over $3 million, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3367)|
| 0:56:16| when you look at our whole budget, that is five thousandths of one percent of our entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3376)|
| 0:56:26| And as Joe said, the effect on our bond rating is negligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| So we can do what we need to do without raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| We can do it without dipping into the reserve funds, although according to our bond advisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| that's not going to hurt us if we needed to for that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Now, if we dipped in $10 million, that might be another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| We're paying, and we will still be paying more on the debt than we paid last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| So we're paying more on the debt than we paid last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| We're not raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| We're not dipping into the reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| And we're still cutting spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| And those were the four things that I think all of us, and especially the mayor, wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3423)|
| 0:57:11| And I want to support the mayor in that, because I think those are four very worthy goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| But I think we can still do this and achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| This is not a win-lose, except when it comes to our community and our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| This could very much be a win-win-win for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Was there a question there from the chairlady, or was that just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Well, I did ask you, I wanted to ask you when you had met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| If you knew who our credit bond raters were, or if you met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| Okay, I'd like to respond to part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I can't speak for Mr. Ayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| but when he met with Mr. Troyer and I last week, that was, it seems to me what he said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3467)|
| 0:57:55| as I stated, I can't speak for him, I don't think he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| If he's here, I'd like him to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| But that is exactly the opposite of what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| And one thing I want to talk to the commission about is the fact that this is our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| This is what we've committed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| This is the word of Knox County that we've given that we're going to pay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| And another fact that keeps, seems to keep getting in the way, since 2004, since 2004, we've doubled our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3495)|
| 0:58:24| That's something I think we should, and I hear people saying it's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Well, I'll tell you who says it's healthy, dadgummit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| It's the people that are loaning us the money, because that's what they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| and they want to get the highest interest rate they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| We are in a situation where I think we can take full advantage of, we can pay down our debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| like we're supposed to, like our schedule says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| We can keep our word to the people that we borrow money from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| And at the end of the day, that's something I think we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Mr. Troyer, I had a couple of questions about debt management also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| As the mayor just said, this was, we're paying, according to this plan, to schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| And so that meant from 2004 forward, we didn't pay to schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| but you were in charge of debt management being the financial, the CFO of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| So while you were in that position, what was your, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| what was going on in terms of your department to try to handle the desires of the previous mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| and also be responsible about debt management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| For the record, I was in this position since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| This would be, one of the things that we've done since 2007 is reduce the capital plan each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| And this year, in this proposal that the mayor has made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| is the first time that I can remember that the county is going to borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| less than what the scheduled principal payments are on our bond documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| And so what that would mean is the net effect is that we're reducing our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| And so every year previously, we would pay down a certain amount on principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| but we would borrow more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| This year, those numbers are reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| And so this mayor's capital plan proposal was very clear that that difference is there and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3618)|
| 1:00:29| And so there is no voluntary payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| And there was a couple of, part of the reason that there's a difference in this year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| to last year's budget on the debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| there were a couple of issues that were in the pipeline that were approved prior to the mayor taking office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| And now we're just feeling the effects of those payments for the first time in an annual budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Would you talk about debt in terms of our bond ratings and what our goals are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| And that being, all right, we're AA plus rating Moody's right now, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| Yeah, we're AA1 with Moody's and AA plus with Standard & Poor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| And so we're, those are good bond ratings, something that our community can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| I think, you know, it has been brought up and we've talked about it within the office of the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| is that, okay, what are the things that we can do to achieve a AAA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| And those are, I don't have percentiles memorized, but we're good in our current rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3693)|
| 1:01:42| And it's a very select group that are the one step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| And we've had discussions in the mayor's office, what will it take to get us to the next level and the AAA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| And I think as a community goal, I think that would be a tremendous goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| Obviously, we would certainly need the legislative body's endorsement of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| And there's a number of things that are outside of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| Are there other, besides, and there's a lot of discussion about these rating agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| and what the real meaning of bonds are and how these ratings, what these ratings really mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3734)|
| 1:02:22| Some other indexes that are meaningful to you, say per capita debt or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| When you think about debt management, what are some of the other things that you rely on to make a, to evaluate where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| We had a serious conversation with John Harris at BB&T last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| And one of the things that he does is that we do have some variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| And so with variable rate debt, you have to constantly pay attention to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| And right now, the credit markets are extremely tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| The bankers are going to check to make sure that you have dotted every I and crossed every T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| And credit is extremely difficult to come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| And you can tell this for people who want to get a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| It takes longer to get your mortgage approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| For people who want to sell a house, it takes longer for the buyers to get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| It takes longer to get to the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| It's nationwide. It's global.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| All credit markets are difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| What we had is we had John Harris at BB&T provides a letter of credit to help support and backdrop our variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| Some of our variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| And some of his comments were that he paid very close attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| And he feels strongly that they give it more scrutiny, give Knox County more scrutiny than the rating agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| And we were able to renew our letter of credit, which are very hard to come by, at the same rates that we had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| And so there's no change in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| And so one, we've got the availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| And two, we're getting the same price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| That's two good measures right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| There's a lot of jurisdictions around the United States that are having difficulty getting those letters of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| The mayor just mentioned some discrepancy between what Joe Ayers had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| and how Ms. Broyles characterized the discussion about debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Do you know anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Do you remember the conversation and what he's referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| I was in the meeting with John Harris, the mayor, and Joe Ayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| And I know what I heard Joe say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| And Joe echoed John Harris' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| And so I wasn't a party to Commissioner Broyles' comments or her conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| but I do know that our conversations, just as recently as last week, were positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| I'd like to make a couple of comments because I really don't think there's one person on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| that would not like to see the county employees get a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| But, you know, I think we have to take all of this in the perspective of what's going on in the entire economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| And there's ways that the county employees are compensated that's not out there in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3916)|
| 1:05:26| And part of that deals with the retirement pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| This is the front page of the Wall Street Journal today, June 14th, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| And right here, the top part of the front page, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Retirement plans make a comeback within limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| There's many of the S&P 500, these are the largest companies in the wealthiest country in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| who stopped making any 401K contributions during the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| As a matter of fact, 43% of the S&P 500 companies just quit making retirement plan contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3957)|
| 1:06:07| And, really, retirement plan contributions is real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| I mean, it's money that goes into your savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| You just can't withdraw it until you retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| Looking through these, of the largest companies in the wealthiest country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| only a handful of those even make a 6% matching contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| The vast majority make three, and many of them make a less matching contribution than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| As the county employees know, as you gain seniority, some of those matches go up to 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=3993)|
| 1:06:43| That's unheard of in the private world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Absolutely unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| One of the other points I'd like to make is that this year, right after the first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| I asked the actuary for the Knox County Pension Board to look and see what we were paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| And I'm doing this not as an argument against, because it's just to let the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| our uniformed officers know who we really do respect, and we want to do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| to let them know that we, the county, are making a significant contribution to your pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| Again, you may not see it until you retire, but you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| The percent of payroll covered over the next, I'm just going to give the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| I'm not going to carry it out all the way, because the numbers become absolutely astounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| There's going to be, in 2011, there will be a 15.1% match, a 17.5% match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4050)|
| 1:07:38| and then it goes up to 18.5% in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| No place, there's no matches like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Over the next six years, there will be $24 million put into the officers' retirement fund by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4065)|
| 1:07:53| That's in addition to the money that's not being contributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| So $24 million over the next five years is really a significant amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| and there's absolutely nowhere in the private world that that kind of match is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| Now, I know the argument has been made that the city firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| and that the city police are getting their mandatory step raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| that they have a very similar pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| But also, as you know, Joe Bailey, who's really the acting chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| I know it's the mayor of Knoxville, but he's really the acting chairman of the city council right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| they're calling special meetings about what in the world are they going to do to be able to meet their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| because I believe it's going to consume, it's going to be up to roughly $20 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| that they're going to have to be paying within the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| And that's just money that's not there, and they're having to decide what to do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| So just so everyone knows is that the county is making a commitment to your salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| is making commitments to what you're being paid that really no one else in the country has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| And that is a commitment that the county has, and we are going to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| But that is a significant amount that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| You just can't draw on it right now, but you will get that money someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| I'm sorry, my question is on the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| We're talking about BB&T and Mr. Harris and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| I just want to say for the record I'm on the advisory board for BB&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| and I think Mr. Troyer's office will verify and also the trustee's office will verify that my name has never been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| talking with Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| And I recuse myself when I vote at BB&T if anything has to do with Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| I had a couple of questions, I guess, for probably John, but two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| And one, I guess, that disturbs me is, you know, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| we need to have a conversation about the defined benefit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| I think we as a commission need to belly up to the bar and say we need to have an honest conversation about what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| going forward with the defined benefit plan as it sits today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4215)|
| 1:10:23| You know, there were several things in there that we didn't enact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| There were some misunderstandings, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| But we have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| We don't want to get to where the city seems to be at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| But to say you're going to get it one day I think is short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| Gas is almost $4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Maybe it's down to $3.75 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| It's down a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Milk is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| We're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| We, again, having a conversation about our recurring and incurring debt is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| But to say that the rest of the public sector is not getting it, I guarantee you they've not gone four years without a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4255)|
| 1:11:07| I guarantee you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| So to cherry pick and say it's bad right now, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4270)|
| 1:11:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| But we've got to look at this thing in totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| So, you know, we have to, again, have an honest conversation about what we're going to do going forward, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| as it relates to the pension process and how we let folks in and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| But we have a today question that we haven't answered for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| So, you know, I think this is, you know, it's modest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| But it's going to put, if it puts $25 to $35, which is probably what it's going to end up doing in most of these folks' pockets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| that's about what we're talking about every pay period, that that's significant for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| And so that's one thing I just wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| And the second, to comment on what the mayor said, that people say it's healthy, and he disagreed to have this debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| He may have been talking about one context, but the people that I say it's healthy are the folks in Powell with their new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| library, the folks out of South Knoxville with their new senior citizen center, the folks in Corrington with their new center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| Those are the folks that are saying it's healthy because they're enjoying the fruits of that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| We weren't out just doing crazy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| We were not on the commission then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| We built facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| The folks in East Knoxville, they have a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| The folks at Beck, they got facilities out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| So we're not talking about things that we were just out just, you know, raising all kinds of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| We're talking about solid investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| And it was debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| It was significant debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| But these things you guys are proud of, and I'm proud of, when I go to see the senior citizen center in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| I'm proud that a county is able to provide a service like that for its constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| The Powell Library is architecturally beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| Every time I drive by that place, I'm amazed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| It's a great facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| And that community has embraced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| So to say that was a terrible thing to do, and that's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| That was terrible to do back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| That's what we're saying when we say we shouldn't have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| What I'm saying is, in spite of all that, we have the next to highest bond rating ever that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4411)|
| 1:13:41| The highest bond rating ever in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| Those are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Quit throwing out pieces and parts and using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| You talk about the other countries and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| To be quite honest, the other foreign entities that Richard spoke of also have health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4434)|
| 1:14:03| So their health care costs are probably nil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| So when you talk about they're not giving as much for their benefits, yeah, they're probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| But they're not spending as much either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| So, you know, again, those other countries have a lot more government control than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| So it's an apples to oranges comparison, and we constantly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| We constantly do that to make our point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| It's the wrong thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| My final question is, and I distinctly do remember the mayor saying that we're paying more on our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4472)|
| 1:14:42| Additional payments on our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| I don't have the quote here, but I'm pretty darn sure during his mayoral address, that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| So, John, I'm trying to understand when did we change this schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| I'm trying to get to the root of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Did we change anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Did we change anything from our process in 2004, or were we just not, they said you owe five million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| and we said now we're going to pay two million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| What's the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| The honest answer, just straight plain English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| I think they're just a basic misunderstanding that there was an opportunity for the county to pay voluntarily extra this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| But my question is, did we change something in the last, say, year, June 13th, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| in the last year, did we change our process by where we were to pay back our millions of millions of dollars in debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4534)|
| 1:15:46| Only one change, and I think the short answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| I mean, we made one slight change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| We had some leases that provided financing for energy management projects that were self-funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| We refinanced those, and now we run those through the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| But that's neutral as far as the debt service fund, because they pay for themselves in the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| So I think the short answer to your question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| But what we're seeing is that we're seeing the effects of the last several years' debt issues, our payments are kicking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4570)|
| 1:16:22| And so I hope I've answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4582)|
| 1:16:30| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| And I want to give the members of the public who are here and want to speak on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| I hope that will give them an opportunity to after we have finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| There have been a couple of things said that I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| To say that this is a scheduled payment means that this is the schedule that the county has decided that they're going to pay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4611)|
| 1:17:02| I can guarantee you that our minimum payment is not $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| In fact, I had asked someone to put those numbers for me together, and I don't have them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4628)|
| 1:17:15| But there's a difference about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| When you're talking about schedule, this is the schedule that Knox County, this is Knox County's schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4639)|
| 1:17:33| And it can be changed, because I guarantee you that it's more than the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| When we talk about, and another reason I know that we've been paying, and we have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| and I think this is, Tony, where maybe you had a question, too, that wasn't clarified very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| We have been paying on our debt all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| We've been paying on our debt all of these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Because one of the things that I talked to Joe about was debt repayment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| And especially in terms of how that affects our bond rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| And he said, well, you know, when you look at Knox County, for your repayment of debt, you've been average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| That means we're not paying too little, we're not paying too much, we aren't paying too slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4692)|
| 1:18:20| We're average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| So, obviously, we've been doing something right for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| We've been paying our debt, and we've been paying it at the amounts that we're expected to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4706)|
| 1:18:35| Also, those who want to talk about our economy, and as it relates to, and I'm not sure that it was other countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| I think maybe it was other counties or other states, private companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| But our, and this is one of the things that Joe Ayers said, too, was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| and that the bond rating companies look at is that the economy of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| And he was talking about how very fortunate we are here in Knox County because we have a very stable economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| And it's been hard for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| It's been hard for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| It's been hard for a lot of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| But because some of our largest employers are TVA, ORNL, the University of Tennessee, the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4757)|
| 1:19:26| we're very fortunate because that helps keep our economy very, very stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| So we've not been hit as hard as counties and states surrounding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| And I think that's a very important point to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| And it stands to reason that going forward, because of those same reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| when we are hit with a nationwide recession, it's not going to be felt as badly here as it is in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4790)|
| 1:19:59| And that's what makes this one of the best areas to live, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| is that the economy here is remarkably stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| Also, I want to talk about the retirement plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| And in my position paper that I had posted on the forum, one of the headings is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| what about those pension plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| And, yeah, we need to talk about this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| We're going to have to reevaluate how we do our pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| And it may be time to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| And I hope very much that that's a conversation that we're going to have moving forward in this next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| But the bottom line is that there's not anything we can do about it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| And there's also a perception out there that county government or government workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4844)|
| 1:20:53| there's all these perks that the public don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| They're not all these perks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| These people pay to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| They pay on their health insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| Really, there aren't – well, Bright Starts is cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| Bright Starts has been completely cut out of this budget, so they don't even have Bright Starts anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| But to intimate that there's these secret perks out there for county employees is just simply wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4877)|
| 1:21:25| and it's irresponsible to suggest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4885)|
| 1:21:36| And retirement plans are about average for what they were about 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4896)|
| 1:21:46| And, yeah, things have changed and we need to probably reevaluate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| But, again, we can't do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| And today retirement plans do not put food on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| So I think that we need to take care of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| and we need to evaluate these retirement plans moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| I also think that another thing that Mr. Ayers mentioned as we were talking about our bond rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| is not just what kind of debt you have, but what do you have to show for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| And Sam outlined some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| I've got a list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| Gibbs Elementary, Cedar Bluff Primary, Cedar Bluff Intermediate, Hardin Valley Academy, Burlington Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| Fountain City Library, Halls Library, Powell Library, the expansion of Strang Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| $15 million in physical plant improvements at schools, the Veterans Nursing Home, the Veterans Memorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| Powell Middle School, South Knoxville Senior Center, Carter Senior Center, Corrington Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4965)|
| 1:22:54| and the expansion at O'Connor Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| These were all great projects, and I'm proud to have them in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| So I don't think that going into debt for these, for the amount of debt that we went into, the sky is not falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4984)|
| 1:23:17| Nobody is panicking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| I think that it's also worthwhile to mention that when we talk about whether or not debt is healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| that's a very misleading term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| There are economists who say that you don't want your debt to go over 10% of what your budget is, and not that that's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5009)|
| 1:23:39| That's not categorized that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| It's just that that's average, that's the normal amount, that's the kind of amount that makes you look healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5021)|
| 1:23:52| But I'm not saying that it's healthy to have 10% debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| But that's a little misleading to say it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| I also think that, especially in terms of this debt, you know, the quickest way to kill something is to make people afraid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5040)|
| 1:24:12| And if you run around yelling that the sky is falling, even though revenues have been up for the last 13 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| according to the state, which I believe has been largely driven by East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| if we're paying more on our debt than we paid last year, you know, the sky is not falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5064)|
| 1:24:35| This is not an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| There is no reason to panic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| And there's no reason to be scared to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| And it's the easiest thing in the world to kill something by making people afraid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| And I've seen that happen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| And I hope that we are all going to be smart enough to take a measured approach to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| and not run around screaming the sky is falling because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Another thing we can do, you know, every year when we close out the books, we've got extra money left over every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| And that's because we always underestimate our revenue and overestimate our expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| So we've got closeout at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| We can very easily turn around and put that money down on the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| We could do the same thing next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| And if our revenues continue to increase at the rate they've been increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| then we won't have any trouble at all next year putting down an extra $4 million on the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| So we're not delaying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| And I also hear often that, well, we can't leave this debt for our children and our grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| And that's where I think people are getting county debt and state debt and federal debt confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5139)|
| 1:25:47| These are 20-year bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| They will be paid off in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| We do not this is not the federal government and that we leave this debt around for generations to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| This will be paid in 20 years because those are the terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| I also want to point out a couple of things for people who think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| I just want people to understand where our employees are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| We had the Human Resources Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| In fact, it was Commissioner Smith that requested this, the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| And I don't know if everybody's had a chance to look at it yet, but it had some really interesting statements in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| One is that there are two groups in the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| the corrections officers and the patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Both groups are lagging the market, and they both have a large number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| For those two groups, we're talking about over 500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| The corrections officers are 34% below the midpoint for their job in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5205)|
| 1:26:55| Our patrol officers are 19% below the market average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| And from what I understand from this survey, in this survey, anything above 20% is a cause of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5221)|
| 1:27:11| So our corrections officers are 34% below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| Patrol officers are 19% below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| And if we don't give them a raise this year, they're going to be 20% below within the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5238)|
| 1:27:30| In the next county's other departments, which is everybody but the sheriff and the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| the corrections officers in the juvenile detention or juvenile division, they lag the market by 26%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5256)|
| 1:27:44| And the environmental specialists in the health department, those are our restaurant inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| They are 25% below average market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| Now, one of the interesting things about all four of these groups, they're all about public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| These are the people who manage our jails, they patrol our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| and they make sure that our food supply is safe when we go out to eat at a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| And they are all more than 20% below market average for this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5290)|
| 1:28:19| And according to the salary survey, those are significant areas of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| A lot of employees around here are getting a raise this year, but they're not our county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| The mayor is getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| The fee officers are getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| Some of the employees in fee offices are getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| The teachers are getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| And I think it's terribly unfair that these other individuals and these other departments are getting raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5329)|
| 1:28:58| but we're not going to step up and do it for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| When we talk about insurance rates and parking, insurance rates have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| Parking is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| It's doubling within two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| It's already gone up, and we have not responded in a meaningful way with compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5356)|
| 1:29:24| So our employees are taking home less money now than they did two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| Their checks are smaller because they're having to pay more for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| and they're having to pay more for their health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| And when we look at, and all of this is on the forum right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5375)|
| 1:29:42| when we talk about steps versus percentages, initially I was suggesting a 3% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| and then I got myself educated about the differences between steps and percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| A one-step raise is what the employees prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| because it preserves that seniority that comes with time served, I guess you could say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5398)|
| 1:30:07| And it's also cheaper for the county to do the step increase rather than a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| So it's better for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| It's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| And fiscally, it's easier for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| So what I'm proposing is a one-step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| And, again, that doesn't address benefits at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| I think that Commissioner Brown's suggestions about letting folks volunteer to do a reduced work day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5428)|
| 1:30:37| or work week or taking the summers off, I think that's brilliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| I think that's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| And I hope that our human resources department will look at that and see if we can make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| because I think that's something that a lot of our employees would appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| and would take advantage of if we offered it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| So that's another way that we can save with our personnel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| So is the pay raise really and truly needed this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Can we afford to do it without sending the county spiraling into destruction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| And there isn't any reason why we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| Remember, all the people that work in this building, they're taxpayers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| And all the people who work in this building, they're our constituents, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| They're not some other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| They're not chattel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| And a lot of them are in just as dire financial straits as some other families out there in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5495)|
| 1:31:43| And if we can do this for them without hurting the county, which very obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| by all the information that's been presented here, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| And we need to move forward and we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| And I would like to, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| I'll try not to filibuster a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| But, you know, here's where I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| We've jumped on John Troyer here and we've asked him why he's doing what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| He's not the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Elections have consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| This community voted 85 percent to go with this mayor and what he wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| and how he wanted to do his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| John Troyer didn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| This mayor has come in and told John Troyer, I need you to cut, cut, cut, cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| And that's what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| I just want to remind us, you know, that elections do have consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| And I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| We've had a call for the question, so we will vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| You'll need a second for the call of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| There's a second for the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Is it two-thirds vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| It will take a two-thirds vote, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| It will be seven people to vote for the call, starting with the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5583)|

| 1:33:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| No, I would like to give the members of the public who are here an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| Commissioner Royals votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5593)|

| 1:33:19| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Are there any other commissioners here that wanted to speak on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Yes, I did also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| If there's people here that want to speak, then I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Commissioner Lauderdale, can we change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| I mean, if commissioners won't speak, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| Well, the voting is, voting needs to ride out its natural course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5625)|
| 1:33:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| Commissioner Smith votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5635)|

| 1:34:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Commissioner Hammond votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5645)|

| 1:34:07| Commissioner Shouse votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Votes 9-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| So we will continue with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| John, quick question for you, if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| On page 15 of the budget book that you gave us, Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| is that where you're getting the $5 million difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| Or are you just getting it from what Mayor Beatrice said in his address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| And I'm looking at the bottom line on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Is that what we're paying down in debt this year, school and county together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| It went from $66,750,000 to $71,750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| That's the total principal interest, county and school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| So that's what the schools and the county are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Because at first when we started talking about this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| I was wondering if we were just paying up some debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| But I look at the lines here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| General schools went up $3.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Payment from school construction went up $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| So there's your $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| And then you've got $1 million from the operating transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| $1 million difference there, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Yeah, that is to help pay for the payments that relate to the energy management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| The train contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| Right, that's the train contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| So the savings from that contract will help pay the debt on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| So the $5 million really goes back to school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Are the schools, is this a scheduled school payoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| Because I like Ms. Burrell's plan if we're just paying extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| But if we're just paying our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| Yeah, we're just paying our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| If we've got our payment book and we're mailing in our yearly payment for you guys, that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| We have two people who have signed up to speak to this, I believe, Mark Taylor and Rick Trott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| If both of you would make your way to the podium, I'll recognize Commissioner Owenby and then we'll hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| John, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| Do we, and I just want to clarify for me so I know, what bonds or loans, whatever you want to call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5768)|
| 1:36:17| do we still have their interest only right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| And what's the payoff on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Yeah, I don't have the schedule in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| But we do have one, namely the Hardin Valley bond issue, which was issued at the same time as the pension bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| And that's interest only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| And if I'm correct, we pay interest only for 25 years, is that correct, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| I was thinking that it was 20, but we can share that with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| It's an extended period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| And the thought process behind that was it was issued about the same time as the pension bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| and so they would fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| But, yes, we do go a number of years without principal payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| So we pay interest only until we get to the principal on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| So the principal could be another ten years after that, 20 years after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Mr. Mark Taylor, if you would come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| And if you would give us your address for the record, you will have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| Mark Taylor, 720 Hall of Fame, Fraternal Order of Police President, Volunteer Lodge 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| Thank you, Commissioners, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| I represent over 900 members of law enforcement in this community in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5851)|
| 1:37:37| We very much support these employees getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| As Commissioner Broyles pointed out, corrections officer is down 34 percent, patrol officer down 19 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5861)|
| 1:37:50| These employees aren't your average employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| These employees require a great deal of training, a substantial investment on the part of the county and the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| and their worth increases as they spend time on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| To be honest with you, this isn't a quick turnaround thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| It takes you several years to learn how to be a good law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| And the county benefits by retaining those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| With these numbers, the county is going to have difficulty retaining those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| There are too many agencies, as pointed out in your own study nearby, that are willing to pay substantially more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| and have been paying substantially more on each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| It's been about four years since these guys had a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Commissioner Briggs, I'd like to point out on your assessment of the city pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| I think your assessment was sort of correct, but I think you've got your personnel mixed up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| That was outgoing mayor and now governor Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| And when they quoted that, and I'll give you an example of how these numbers can change in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| and people get all hyped up on that fear, 30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| First it was 2019, 30 million it's going to require to fund the city pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| Now no one will say a number because that number is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| That pension has regained over 70, 80 million in that time just by the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| So people saying 30 million, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| People saying this is going to throw our bond rating to the bottom, probably not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| But it's something that gets everybody scared and makes them not consider something thoughtfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| And I would challenge you, if you hold up that paper and you say retirement benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| which is another hot button topic in America today for our public safety employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| but I challenge you to go back and look and compare the salaries of those Fortune 500 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5982)|
| 1:39:50| to the salaries of your Knox County deputies and corrections officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Because I'll tell you now, sir, there's not a Fortune 500 company that stays a Fortune 500 company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=5995)|
| 1:40:04| underpaying its employees 34 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| There's not a Fortune 500 company that stays a Fortune 500 company underpaying its employees 19 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| Mr. Taylor, you have a minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| So I guess what I'm asking you to do is make an investment in your human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| your human capital that you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| And it's a valuable asset that the county has as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| These guys work hard every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| They're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| They're going to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| But please take some time and thoughtfully and in context compare those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6037)|
| 1:40:45| Your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| And you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Rick Trott, 5913 Wooded Acres Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and commissioners, for the opportunity to speak to you on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| Unfortunately, Commissioner Brewer stole my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| You said everything I was going to come up here and say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| And you're to be commended for it, and we applaud you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6064)|
| 1:41:13| I will say this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I was sitting in this very chamber not too long ago listening to the department heads come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| during a workshop that you held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| And they were talking about their budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| and how they would be affected by the new budget that the mayor had brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| And a lot of them made good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| A lot of them were happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| But Dr. McIntyre came down, and he spoke to you about his budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| and the fact that teachers were going to get an increase in pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Commissioner Brown at that point, you get it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| You ask him, how can you justify increases in teacher salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| when the rest of county employees get nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| And he could have simply said, well, it's mandated by the state, so we've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| But he didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| He said what was on his heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| and he said what was on the minds and hearts of others who decide that they get a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| And that was we need to make our teachers feel valued by giving them increases in pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| He said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| I was sitting right over here, and I was taken aback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| They struck a chord with me, and I started to think, well, how valued am I, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| It really took me aback, and I started to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| I started to think about all the things that law enforcement officers do on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| I started to think about what other county employees do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| what you commissioners do, and really put that in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| When was the last time that any of you sat in a pod at the intake center with murderers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| and rapists and child molesters, and there's nothing separating you from that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| and you've got the courage to go in there and do that job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| It amazes me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| You know, when the things go really bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| civilians tend to go this way, away from the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| And the law enforcement officers, based on the commitment that they've made to their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| they run toward the trouble, and they stay as long as it takes to get it under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| And that's a valued employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| You know, teachers are so valued that we're going to give them pay increases automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| Knoxville City police officers are so valued that we're going to give them pay increases automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Their law says, by charter, that they have to give them those increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| The same with highway patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| The same with firemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| But county deputies are reduced to collective begging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| You know, we come here and we collectively beg for what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| It just doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| So I think what Commissioner Burroughs did earlier, she just reduced this down to its fundamental parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| and it's an up or down vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| Are Knox County employees worth five thousandths of one percent, or are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| Because your vote is going to tell us here in a few minutes how you feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6260)|
| 1:44:33| The motion on the floor is to provide a one-step pay increase for Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| with the monies to come on monies allocated for debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| What's the cost of that for us, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| There's cost implied if we refinance, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| Yeah, I mean, I guess I would look for clarity, too, on how that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| I mean, what we've got scheduled for debt service is what the payments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| And so how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6304)|
| 1:45:14| I'm assuming that your motion would be to the monies that are allocated in the budget for debt service would be reduced by what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| 2.7 million, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| It would still be the remainder would still be deposited into the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| And we would still be paying more on our debt than we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| And I also would suggest that at the end of the year when we do closeout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| the funds that are left over at closeout also be paid on the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| And then next year, if things continue in the same manner that they are, that they have been for the last 13 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6345)|
| 1:45:53| then we will find it much easier to put, at that point, we can put an additional 4 million in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| We should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| We have a roll call vote starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| I'm still trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| I don't know what the cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| I know it's 2.7, but then we'd have to buy bonds to pay that 2.7 to pay our bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6368)|
| 1:46:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| We're not paying extra on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Where do we take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| The 2.7 has to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| If you take it from debt service, it has to come from somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| So, John, tell me, what is the minimum amount that we have to pay on our debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| The minimum amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| That's exactly the only voluntary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| The only additional thing that we are adding to the debt service fund is, and I'll get it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| it's interest related to what's in the capital plan for the current year, and that's $670,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| That's 4.66% of $14.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| And, you know, okay, if you were to not do any of the capital plan, the schools would have to cut their capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6414)|
| 1:47:03| The county would cut its capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| And then we don't pay interest on that money for one year, and that's $670,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| We're still short, you know, another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| I ask, what, give me a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| What is the minimum payment, truthfully, the minimum payment that we have to pay on our debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6439)|
| 1:47:28| What I'm trying to say is that our proposed budget, $71,750,000, and the only thing that's not on a schedule, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6448)|
| 1:47:37| we don't have a range and say, okay, this month your minimum payment is $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| We've got a commitment, a contract that says that we're going to pay this much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| and the only piece that's not committed is what's in for the current year's capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| and so that's interest on 14.4, $670,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| So our number for debt service needs to be $71,000,001 in round numbers, which isn't enough to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6476)|
| 1:48:05| And that would also require that we would need to take out virtually all of the county's capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| and quite a bit of the school's capital plan in order to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| And so that's what you're trading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| I still haven't heard an exact number there, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6502)|
| 1:48:32| I mean, you know, I hate to do math at the podium because I get it wrong so many times, but if you insist, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6512)|
| 1:48:41| Commissioner, would you prefer to take it out of the fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| Like I said, my conversation with Joe Ayers this morning, I said, to take out $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| what's going to hurt us less, fund balance, debt fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| And his exact words were, with the size of your budget and the way your debt looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| you could take it from either place and it will have no effect on your credit rating, on your bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6545)|
| 1:49:14| And I said at the beginning of this, it doesn't matter to me where we take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| but it matters very much to me that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| So if somebody wants to offer an amendment, Mike, if you would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| I'm not offering an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| I'm thinking if you want to make it very easy, I mean, it would be easier on your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| I'm not saying I'm supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| I'm saying if you want to make it easier, that would be an easier way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| It's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| So what I heard this morning from our bond advisor is that we can take it from this debt payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6583)|
| 1:49:52| and it won't hurt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| We can take it from the fund balance and it won't hurt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| So I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| Either way, whatever the majority of the commissioners are comfortable with is what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Is Commissioner Burrell's amendment proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| Saying that we would take these funds out of the five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| Is that a proper amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| If it's proper, then I think we need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| I mean, no disrespect, but if it's a proper amendment before the commission, I'm not trying to beat up on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| John, but, you know, if it's proper to vote on, then we need to vote on it and not be questioned on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| unless there's a question from the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| And then those questions should be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| So I'm just trying to just strictly structural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Brad, is that going to ease your heartburn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| No, because I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| I mean, I want this to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| I want the employees to have a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6649)|
| 1:50:57| I want the employees to have a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| I think they deserve a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| But you can't sit down an amendment and say I want, I don't know, 2.7 million and say I don't care where it comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6661)|
| 1:51:10| We need to know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| I mean, this is, I mean, it's a minute amount of money for this size of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6673)|
| 1:51:19| But we have to know where it comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| We can't just vote on because I want to give them a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| This has got to be real money and we've got to have a real fund to pull it out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| It is real money, agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| And we are pulling it out of that debt payment is where that is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| And the debt payment has to, that is our, the 71,750 minus 600-something thousand interest for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6697)|
| 1:51:46| then you're eliminating the current capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| You're going to eliminate the current capital plan by doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| which if that's what your amendment is going to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| It's not just taking 2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| I mean, you've got to pay that mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| You've got to pay that due bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Again, that's why I'm, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| So you can't just say take it out of debt service payment because that is, that has to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| Again, I guess we're differing on what the minimum payment should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6733)|
| 1:52:21| Like I said, from my conversation this morning, it could come from either place and not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6741)|
| 1:52:32| So if it's going to be an issue for you or an issue, then let's, then I'm, change my amendment then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6752)|
| 1:52:42| Because if we're going to just keep going around and around on this, let's just make it real simple and straightforward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| and say that the money that we're going to appropriate is not going to come out of the debt payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| It will come out of the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| Because that's not going to have an effect on our bond rating either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6775)|
| 1:53:05| I wish Mr. Ayers was here because we've heard two different stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| And that 2.7 that you take out of fund balance, it becomes 3.0 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| It becomes 3.5 the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| And if things continue the way they're trending now, the revenues are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| And then they're going to continue to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| The revenues have went up the last four years and we've cut the budget $10 million in the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| and we're still wrestling every year about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| Right, but it's been a very slow uptake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| It says that for the last 13 months revenues have been up, not prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| So that's their most recent report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| And like the gentleman said who's in here talking about the pension, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| to speculate that it's going to be, you know, $30 million or $40 million or whatever in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6838)|
| 1:54:07| the bottom line is that we can do the right thing for our employees right now today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| And then we've got a year to go in and work on the pension to decide how we're going to go forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6854)|
| 1:54:24| So the bottom line is are we going to do the right thing for our employees or are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| The question that I have really goes back about an hour and a half probably in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| What is actually the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| That we have a three percent raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| It's a step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| It would be one step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| And the cost would be $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| And what I see it boiling down to, I attended 10 or 12 of the presentations of the budget to community citizen groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6897)|
| 1:55:14| And by and large, the presentations were all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| I think that's all the mayor knew to do is stand up and say the same thing over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| And from that, I think I heard the same thing every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6925)|
| 1:55:33| What I was looking for, though, in the 10 or 12 meetings was the response of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6933)|
| 1:55:42| They varied a little bit from group to group because in some places, as at the Corrington Senior Center, it was an older group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6942)|
| 1:55:52| One of the group meetings in South Knoxville was a relatively 40 to 45-year age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6952)|
| 1:56:00| And what I'm here today is not to represent the mayor, but I'm here to represent the responses that I received in those 10 or 12 meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6960)|
| 1:56:12| from the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| And with the exception of emails from people that are going to get a pay raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| with the exception of people that are standing in the room right now that are going to get a pay raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| I've not come across any large, I haven't come across any number of people, citizens of Knox County, saying this is the thing to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6985)|
| 1:56:37| I know we've said it several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| We've said it several times here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| We've opened the door to looking at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| I believe the mayor got us the budget earlier than we probably ever had it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| But what we've boiled this down to is today we're making an appeal, an emotional appeal to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7011)|
| 1:57:03| That's not the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| What we should be doing is looking at where we are, and I should know what the motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| I shouldn't be listening to this is what we've got to do and we've got to do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| The thing that bothers me about the numbers that we had before is because I really looked at if it was a 3% raise on a $75,000 person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7037)|
| 1:57:26| that's $2,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| What we keep talking about in the emotional plea, though, is the people that are at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| Let's take a $22,000 person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| Maybe that's too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| But let's take a $25,000 person and they're not getting $700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| We're throwing out a solution that's not helping the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7064)|
| 1:57:51| And we're doing it today on an emotional plea, and I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| Dave, do you understand that it's not a percentage, it's a step increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| Well, that's what bothered me about the percentage, too, is that the people on the high end were going to get more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| And the step increase evens that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| I just received a text from Mr. Joe Ayers who said that he answered some generic questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| but stated that most were policy related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7094)|

| 1:58:22| Okay, the motion on the floor is to provide a step increase of $2.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| with the money coming from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| Roll call vote starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| If this fails, can number one, can the budget be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7113)|
| 1:58:41| Let's say revenues spike or we come up with a different idea a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| Can the budget be amended, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| Well, once you pass a consolidated budget in terms of subsequent amendments to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| Let's say two months from now revenues are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| We come up with a compromise or we do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| Can amendments be made to the budget midyear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7142)|

| 1:59:08| Yes, especially in terms of normally that's anticipated for emergency purposes as a budget shortfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| but conceivably through the public vetting process you conceivably move funds around as the need arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7154)|
| 1:59:22| I think we've done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110614budget?start=7164)|
