| 0:04:04| My business, yes, is Tennessee, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Okay. Is the information on the application current and accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=250)|

| 0:04:16| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Okay. Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| Has beer ever been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| This is a new location, correct? You're currently under construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Correct. We're supposed to be opening up May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Okay. So there's no outstanding license, and this is for both on and off premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Okay. Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| No, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| You're leasing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| I'll need to check on that. I'm not 100 percent sure with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| I'm the acting general manager of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| The owner, Alpaz Patel, is who I report to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I work for Kana Hotel Management Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| I'm not sure as far as with the arrangement of the land is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| So this particular individual, are they the sole owner of this corporation, or do they have partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Yes. No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| They're as partners in this venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Do they have any interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Do you know any greater than 5 percent of the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| I'm not sure, sir. I don't know that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Okay. And you're going to be the one operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Yes, the hotel. I'm the general manager of the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Okay. This one's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Are you familiar with the laws of Knox County, Tennessee, the beer laws of Knox County, Tennessee, and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with those laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Have you had time to train your servers and completed the server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| No, sir, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| No, sir, I haven't. We haven't hired those positions yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| Okay. I'm going to ask for some reports here, which I think will be some contingency zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| But anyway, I'm going to go through this, then I'll turn it over to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=391)|
| 0:06:52| I'm going to ask that just to see if they've applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| We have another question, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Have you applied for a state liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| So that's all I think that the board will need to know here to make some kind of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| You have several things pending here, contingent, I think, that they need to know related to your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Thank you, Mr. Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Motion to approve, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| All the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| So help me understand the nature of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| And I'm asking in terms of how you're going to have on-premises and off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Could you describe a scenario where you have on- and off-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| Well, I guess the reason why they ended up applying for that particular license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| if we did any type of off-site catering or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| But the market itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| It's on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| You don't have a bar in the back or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Strictly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Coach, what's planned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Where's that at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Across the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| I guess the question I would ask in the building is real close to that 500 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| It may not be in violation because the ordinance says where beer is served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| So I would have to have more than a tentative place where beer is served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Since it's getting a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| I'm just concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| I would think that a six-lane interstate separation would kind of play into a little common sense there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| But do you know when you're going to get your liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Have you applied, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Yes, we have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Do you understand what we're kind of talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| You're close to a plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| And if you get your liquor license, we have to give you a go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| The other thing is I would have to issue a letter to the TABC that says this building is in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| before you can get your liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| So basically it depends on the coach's decision on whether he's in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| Do you think he's in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Well, I think he will be if it's done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| I don't think there's a problem with this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| You made it pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Yeah, I made it pending, but, I mean, even if he didn't get his liquor license for a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| he couldn't unless Roy goes out and measures and it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| I'll try to get you more defensive than that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| I just want to make sure he can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| I don't want to hold him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Are you just referring to where the bar is located in the hotel itself or the building itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| It's where it appears to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| So you're talking about the bar itself area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| So what I would have is when are they planning on opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| May the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| May the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I mean, I can give you an answer possibly in a day or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| The motion's before us to approve with these contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| And so I'm assuming that you're going to be in contact with codes there to fulfill those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| We're going back to Mr. Chabon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Chabon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Is Mr. Chabon here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Looks like he's still not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| So we want to push that to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| We'll just push that off to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Any other issues here before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| See you at 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Ladies and gentlemen, to our March Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| And we're starting today with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| We have some folks from public financial management here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Welcome to you all to present us a topic here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| And following that, we have a number of people who want to speak at public forum on our back country fee issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=698)|
| 0:11:50| So let's go ahead and start with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| And, Mr. Caldwell, do you want to introduce our guest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| I'd like to go ahead and introduce the two individuals who will speak to you all today from PFM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| Lauren Lowe and Alfred McCuney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| They're going to talk to you about our credit profile, debt and swap management, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| So I won't take any more of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| You can hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| And they say they're willing to entertain questions as they go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| So feel free to stop them if you have a question, and they will answer anything that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=752)|
| 0:12:42| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| I'm Lauren Lowe with PFM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I'm based out of our Memphis, Tennessee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| And Alfred McCuney, my colleague, is based out of our Philadelphia office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| And just to give you a little bit of information in color related to PFM and specifically myself and Alfred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| we are an independent financial advisory firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| We service state and local governments related to financial advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Specifically, I focus on debt and credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| And my territory that I cover primarily is the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Alfred is out of Philadelphia, where we are located, our headquarters are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| And Alfred serves as our in-house expert as it relates to accounting for derivatives or swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| And so he will focus on that area of this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| I'll focus more on the credit aspects of the county as well as the debt component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| And I know that you all have a giant book of information in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| I don't plan to go through the whole thing, so nobody panic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| I will go through the presentation portion of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| And then, obviously, the remaining portions are for you to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| It's supporting information, reports, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| And I'll refer to some of those throughout the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| So as Chris mentioned, we're going to talk to you a little bit about the county's existing credit profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Just to remind this group, the county has a very strong rating with Moody's of a AA1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| which is one notch off of the highest rating that Moody's offers the public sector of a AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| And with S&P, the county is rated AA+, which is one notch off of S&P's highest rating, which is a AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=852)|
| 0:14:21| I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the outstanding debt of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Just as a reminder, I was actually with this group in March of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| So everything is similar context, similar format, similar discussion topics, but it is current and up to date as of March 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=869)|
| 0:14:38| We're going to talk a little bit about the swaps and the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| as it relates to debt, but obviously the more mechanics of the swap and accounting thereof will be covered by Alfred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| And then we do a benchmarking study to compare the county against comparable credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| both in the state and outside the state, as well as Moody's produces a report annually related to all the credits that they rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| So we did a comparison analysis to the county versus those three different sample sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| It's in your packet of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| I will refer to it, but I actually won't go through it just out of time issues, but it's behind tab three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| All right, so let's get started, and we'll talk about the county's credit profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| Much of this is very similar to when I talked to you in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| The rating agencies continue to scrutinize and try to understand kind of where local governments are given the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=928)|
| 0:15:37| And I will say that the county has continued to prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| It has a strong credit rating with very few concerns or considerations that have been mentioned by the rating agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| They've referred to the county of having a strong financial position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| and a diverse tax base that has continued to grow over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| In fact, it's grown approximately 6% annually over the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| The economy has showed steady growth in comparison to some of the other local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| and the economies that they rate in which they've struggled to get through the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| Specifically, I want to talk to you a little bit about some of the metrics that the rating agencies look at when they rate local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| and I'll talk a little bit more in depth on them later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| but one of which is they refer to the county's reserve funds as being very strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| and speaking to the strong financial management of the county by having these levels of reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| Some areas of concern is related to the above average debt burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| and also the slightly higher debt service as a percent of expenditures for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| I will say that I don't think this has negatively impacted the county's rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| because it's likely attributed to the county's responsibility to fund schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| and to take on additional debt to pay for, whether it be a school, from the ground up or improvements thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| A lot of the local governments that Moody's and S&P rate are actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| they have school districts which the debt is all issued by a school district and not by the governing body like a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1020)|
| 0:17:09| They do cite that there are some exposure risks related to the county's outstanding variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| Just as kind of food for thought, the rating agencies will recognize when an entity has a swap on variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1035)|
| 0:17:23| However, when they refer to variable rate debt outstanding, they refer to the entire portfolio of variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| They don't give consideration to the swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Any questions on that page before I move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| One quick one about the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| You mentioned some earlier, a minute or two ago, school districts that had the debt on their books, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| Would that be districts that had the power to tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| That's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| And as you know, in the state of Tennessee, school districts do not have the ability to tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| But many of the local governments that Moody's and S&P rate actually have the clear distinction between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| there is a taxing authority that the school district has and then, of course, the local government has its ability to issue taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| But that would be only entities outside of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| And so that's why I think when they refer to this above average debt burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| it's because they're comparing Knox County to this larger sample size that includes a lot of local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| who on the front end looked very similar to Knox County, but when you drill down, you realize they have no school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| And that's a large portion of Knox County's debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| So the next page I want to talk to you about, it is a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| I by no means want to walk through each component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| But what I wanted, I think this is helpful information for you all to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| What we have done is it gives you a sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| It gives you the list of comparable counties that we have looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| This is the same list that we used back in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| And how we identified these comparable counties is actually through these different metrics that you see going across the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1133)|
| 0:19:02| We first focused on the Tennessee counties that are similar in size, similar to a metropolitan region, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1142)|
| 0:19:10| which leaves us with Shelby County, Williamson County, Hamilton County, and then Rutherford County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| We opted not to include Metro because it's a metropolitan government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| And then outside of the state, we looked at a regional presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| but also wanted to look at of these counties that we were starting to drill down and look into the metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| are they, what's their tax base, what's the population, have they seen significant growth, and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| And that's how we ended up with the counties that you will see kind of below Williamson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| starting with Charleston County, Cumberland County, DeKalb County, Mobile County, and Richland County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| I do want to point out these are all very good credit ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| of which Charleston County, since I last spoke with you, did receive an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Now, they are a triple, triple A county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| We've also noted that Cumberland County, North Carolina, did receive an upgrade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| and now they are a double A1, double A plus, comparable to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| During the process in 2011, when we were working with administration on determining who the comparable counties were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| we hit a little bit of an interesting point with DeKalb County, Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| in which their ratings were withdrawn because of significant use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| In fact, you will note they only have a Moody's rating, and they do not have an S&P rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| S&P withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| We opted to keep them in because it was almost one end of the spectrum that we felt like we should not stop a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| just because of certain decisions that were made within the county at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| So you'll see they are significantly below Knox County's rating, but we've left them in for comparison purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Yes, does this show their fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Is this 264?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Is that their present fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| In fact, if you – I don't want to jump too far ahead, but behind tab three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| there's actually some charts that show where it tracks fund balance, and you'll see it goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Visually, you'll be able to tell what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| And kind of speaking along those same lines, in the next page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| I refer to the actual ratios that we have tracked and monitored for Knox County and the comparable counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| and this is on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| And I want to tell you, I'm not going to go through each one of them and what the results look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| As I referred to, there is actually charts behind tab three that will be helpful information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| but I want to talk to you a little bit about why they're important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| and, in general, how the county looks in comparison to those sample sizes that I referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| which are within Tennessee, outside of Tennessee, and then within the Moody's Medians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| The general fund balance continues to be important as it speaks to the reserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| that could be available given an unforeseen event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| And then the rating agencies drill down a little bit further and look at the unassigned fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| and they specifically care because this is not reserved for any particular purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| and really speaks to what's available given those unforeseen circumstances referenced in the metric above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1337)|
| 0:22:28| Direct net debt outstanding speaks to pure general obligation debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| so not a revenue stream that offsets a piece of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| It's pure general obligation debt that is supported by taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| And then debt services, a percent of operating expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| really speaks to how leveraged is a public issuer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| how much debt have they taken on in comparison to their other expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| And to give you a little bit of insight as to how the information behind tab three looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| for the general fund as a percent of fund balance as a percent of revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| and the unassigned general fund balance as a percent of revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| Knox County is in line with the Tennessee comps and the out-of-state comps and the Moody's Medians comps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1389)|
| 0:23:18| So you will see those tracks that you can follow behind tab three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| On the direct net debt outstanding and the debt services as a percent of operating expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| it looks like when you look at the graphics, and I don't want to, like I said, jump too far ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| but there in some cases the county looks higher than the Moody's Medians or from the out-of-state comparables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| And this goes back to the discussion that we had earlier about it is likely those comparable counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| and those medians referred to by Moody's do not have school debt associated with their outstanding debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| which is a large portion of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| So I think that has not had any factor into the county's rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| it simply is noted as a means of a metric and something that Moody's continues to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| I want to talk a little bit about the county's property tax in comparison to the in-state comparables that I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| which are Shelby, Williamson, Hamilton, and Rutherford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| I like to tell a little joke when I show this chart on the top left-hand side of your page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| I live in the orange bar, and it looks awfully attractive to be the maroon bar, which is actually where Knox County is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| You will note this is a five-year history of the property tax rate for Knox County and the comparable Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1479)|
| 0:24:49| In 2013, Knox County is second to lowest, with Williamson only being just shy of Knox County at 2.31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1489)|
| 0:25:02| Like I said, I live in the 404 level, which is Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| So I always like when I report this, I have to commend everyone for being an affordable place to live in comparison to where I reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| In taking a little bit further, that property tax rate, and trying to understand what makes up that property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| is the bar chart on the bottom right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| And you will see it's a five-year history of how much of that tax rate is attributed to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| In all five years, Knox County, the percentage of the property tax rate that is attributed to debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| they are the lowest amongst the Tennessee comparables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I will note that Hamilton County is not included in this sample size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| They do not break out their debt service levy, and so they are not included in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| because we didn't want to make any assumptions as to how they do it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| But they do not break it out in terms of what's on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Does this bottom chart reflect what Moody's would consider us not paying enough of our debt off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| or is that just a statement of saying this much of your tax rate is what you're paying your debt with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| No, they certainly would not see it as that you're not paying enough of your debt off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| If anything, they see it as that there is, I guess, unused capacity in the event it is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1575)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Meaning in comparison to if someone's trying to figure out where they want to live in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Anything else on this page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Well, just and I know you touched on the discussion about the choice of these counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| but in terms of Williamson, is that really a comparison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| You know, in terms of their per capita income, which probably blows us away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It's not really a major urban area within Williamson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| That just seems a little off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Well, yes, I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Obviously, home values play into that significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| And I will say that is often, I've heard it from Hamilton, and I've heard it in Shelby, too, that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| Well, I made it complete, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| I will say the one reason I include them is because they are the longest AAA county in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| meaning they have a AAA by Moody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| So I feel like we always have to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Now, how they got the AAA in comparison to how some of the other counties have been rated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| it's probably different components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| I will say that, and maybe I should have said it on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| there are so many things that go into a credit rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| It's not one particular aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| So I think it's almost you take the Williamson as a comparable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| and you kind of recognize that there's probably factors that go into their credit rating that are outside of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| And I think that that's a very good point to make sure that we all are aware that it is the wealthiest county in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| and likely in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| And I want to talk to you why this is so important and why I believe administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| and I think this should matter to you as a governing body, is that the cost of borrowing, it is low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Rates are extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| They have been low for a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| I learned to quit saying rates won't go any lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| But the credit component or the investor's perception of a credit in the market has changed so much over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1699)|
| 0:28:30| Pre-recession, investors kind of looked at a local government with a decent credit rating and said, sure, I'll buy it, no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| I don't really need to know where it is and understand what the tax base is and the demographics of an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Well, that all changed in around 2008, time frame 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| And what's funny, when I showed you all this chart in 2011, and I started it from 2011 and brought it current, there was this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| you actually saw the bars widen, meaning the bottom, the X axis is the highest rating and the corresponding interest rate, which is a triple A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1734)|
| 0:29:06| The double A category, which is the blue dotted line, is where Knox County is rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| And then you see the cost of borrowing just goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| If you're a single A rating, it's the green line and then goes up to a triple B category, which is the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| Those credit spreads is what we refer to in the market have started trending back down to a more normalized area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| I don't think we'll probably get to the pre-recession time frame ever again because investors became very interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| in wanting to understand who's actually going to pay them and not this unlimited taxing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| That's attractive, but they really want to understand the credit before they buy the bonds or buy any debt in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| So credit becomes even more important, and I think it continues to be a critical component of local governments to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| as they manage their cost of funds going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Now let me talk to you a little bit just about the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Specifically, I've talked about the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I want to talk to you about where's the county's debt today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| and then we'll focus on the swap component piece of the county's debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| On page 12, this is a current snapshot of the county's outstanding debt as of March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1813)|
| 0:30:22| I think this may be a good resource for you all, at least it is for me, because you can look at the tax status per series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| You can look at the mode, meaning if it's a fixed rate piece of debt versus a variable rate piece of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| You can refer to the one that matures, how much is left outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| And also, if it's a variable rate piece of debt, it has a letter of credit associated with it or a loan provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1837)|
| 0:30:46| and those providers are on the right-hand side and expiration date to the far right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| A couple of things have happened since I talked to you in 2011 that is worth mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| The 2005 D3As, which were variable rate bonds, were refinanced into a variable rate loan with PNC Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1859)|
| 0:31:08| That's set to expire in December of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| The 2007 6K1s also refinanced their variable rate bonds into a variable rate loan with U.S. Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| which will expire in the same time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| The county refinanced some outstanding 2003 bonds and did a small piece of capital improvements in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| excuse me, with a series 2012 bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Those were fixed rate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| And probably most notably, since I was last here, the amount of debt outstanding has decreased approximately $23.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1895)|
| 0:31:46| or 3.4 percent since I last spoke to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Could you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Since I was last here in March of 2011, the county's outstanding debt has decreased approximately $23.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| which also translates to about 3.4 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| Let me ask you something quickly there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Chris told me you were coming, so I brought my 2011 book, which I've used quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| And I agree, I'm certainly not disputing that $23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| But on outstanding par, then you had $661 million, and now you've got $667 million, outstanding par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| Is that because of refundings or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| And then also, I have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| I think we did not attribute something with one of the series of bonds we didn't attribute correctly that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Now, we actually went back with administration and went back to the CAFR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| and referred to the 2011 CAFR number that was referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| That actually was an interim number, and I think that maybe it was March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Yeah, it's March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And I think if you look at the time ñ I hate to ask you to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| but on that table, that same table that looks like this, does it have a date on the top left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| Does it say as of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| It says as of July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Well, like I said, we went back and spent time with Melanie and Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| and did confirm that the amount outstanding has gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| I'm not disputing your fact because I don't think I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I think that there was one of those particular series of bonds had something wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| I don't remember exactly the details, but this number has been scrubbed and is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| And I've got a couple of swap questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Do you want them now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Just tell me when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Yeah, we'll do it later because I'm going to go into a little bit more detail about the swaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| and then I'm going to let Alfred take it away with swaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| and we'll certainly tag team as needed on the swap questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| Yeah, I think that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I'll have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| One piece of the county's portfolio that we continue to monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| and I know that the administration does as well, is the opportunity for savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| And so I want to look at the next page, which there's a whole lot of numbers on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| and I will say that there's probably no number you should focus on other than the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| of the outstanding fixed-rate bonds, none of them can be refunded for savings at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| The county has taken advantage of their refunding opportunities already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| but I did want to bring this, show you kind of that we have monitored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| and I know the administration has as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| But I will talk to you about a little opportunity later that hopefully will look to be saving some costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| So then I think this may start kind of touching on the swap component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| and this is the next slide, which is on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| And I certainly don't want to alarm anyone by this risk matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| However, I would refer to these probably as considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| A few more considerations have probably become real considerations since I was here in March of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| Primarily, if you have a variable-rate piece of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| the considerations that we would want to bring to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| and ask the county to continue to monitor as they make decisions on future debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| is that interest rates continue to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| So with variable-rate debt, you have interest rate volatility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| You have the need for a liquidity, which is a factor of the market requires that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| And then obviously any change to the county's credit could impact the variable-rate bonds in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| Because I mentioned earlier, the investors scrutinize and look at credit so thoroughly now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| that they will actually play that into where the rates reset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| if there is a significant change in the public issuer's credit rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| For swap debt, the considerations that we like to bring to the table are basis risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| And I don't want to get too technical because I know Alfred's going to take care of that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| But with a swap, you have a variable-rate that pays a bondholder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| and you have a variable rate that's received from a counterparty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| In the event those two do not move in tandem and, in theory, cancel one another out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| that's referred in the market to as basis risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| And that was a significant component of the 2008-2009 timeframe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| is that those two did not move in tandem, which did cause some disruption with issuers with swap debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2185)|
| 0:36:33| Also the need for a letter of credit, as I mentioned with variable-rate debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| is a part of a swap piece of debt as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And then the exposure to a swap counterparty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| meaning that there's another party in place with a swap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| and certainly if something happens to them, it will be something that we should all continue to monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| A perfect example is when Lehman filed for bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| They were parties to swaps at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Now, most of their swaps were significantly transferred to other banks that were willing to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| But as we've watched a lot of fluctuation in the financial market with banks and their credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| I think it just makes sense for us to continue to monitor these considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| And one risk that maybe I mentioned in 2011 and probably made light of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| and thought it wasn't a real consideration is a reduction in a subsidized interest payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| The county has three different pieces of debt, but two are similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| Build America Bonds and then Qualified Energy Construction Bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| For the Build America Bonds, 35% of the interest is subsidized from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| With the QSCB program, which is actually a loan through the state who actually issued the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| 100% of the interest was subsidized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| With sequestration, that reduction in subsidy has become a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| And as of March 1st, the federal government is set to reduce those subsidized payments by 8.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| I will say that moving through this process is new to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| I can't tell you where it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| It could increase, it could decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| I certainly will not make any statement as to what I think it will happen, because I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| But I know that your administration is continuing to monitor this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| and it is imperative that if you have discussions with the rating agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| that you're on the forefront of knowing that a reduction in your interest payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| or in the subsidized portion of your interest could be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| and how you're going to offset the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Certainly being prepared and being proactive is the right approach to the rating agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| So if the bondholder who bought the Build Americas, a third or 35% was coming from the feds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| that 35% is reduced by 8.7% with sequestration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| The bondholder bought a taxable bond in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| The obligation is for the county or whoever the governing body is to pay them the interest payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| 35% of that interest was going to be paid by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| So 8.7% of the 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Of the 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| So we're on the hook for that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Are we on the hook for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| And the same 8.7 of the 100 of the new square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| We're on the hook for that now because of a potential transfer of a school deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| That's the Southwest Knox County deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| So that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| That is the current information as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I know that we actually could not keep up with it fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| It changed so quickly around the March 1st time frame that I would send out something to Melanie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| and then have to retract and say, wait a minute, it's already changed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| But the bondholder is not going to take the hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| The issuer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Yes, because there were two different types of subsidy programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| Everyone went this route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| There was a direct pay, which this is this route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| The other one was where the actual investor would have taken the hit, but nobody took that route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| because maybe we thought this wasn't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| Any other questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| I'm not alluding to one piece of debt has more considerations than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| It's just all of the considerations that we lay on the table when we look at an outstanding portfolio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| or when evaluating new pieces of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| So thinking about what I just walked through, let me talk to you about the actual capital structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| or the outstanding portfolio of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Approximately 54% of the county's debt is in a fixed-rate bond or a loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| Fifteen percent is in a variable-rate bond or a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| And 29% is swapped, and you have synthetic fixed-rate swaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| meaning the county pays a fixed rate and receives a variable rate in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| We're going to talk about those in more detail because I see you give a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| From the rating agency's perspective, I think they view the county's portfolio as a moderate portfolio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| not over-risky or plain vanilla with just fixed-rate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| S&P ranks it as a 2 out of a scale of 1 to 4, 4 being the most risky, 1 being the least risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2479)|
| 0:41:28| Moody's speaks to how much variable-rate debt they think is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| or how when they start evaluating a percentage of your portfolio, they refer to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| And this goes back to the comment I made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Moody's doesn't account for swap debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| They look at the entire portfolio, so they're going to take the 15 plus the 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| But I think that at the end of the day when they're looking at the credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| they do probably give you some side calculations for how much is swapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| But what they report in their reports is often it is how much of variable-rate debt total do you have exposure to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| Any questions on the portfolio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| And kind of drilling down just a little bit further into variable-rate debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| all of your variable-rate debt is comprised in this pie chart that we have right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| There are three variable-rate bond issues with BB&T as your letter of credit provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| That represents the 54%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| And then the two loans that I referred to that the county refinanced in December of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2548)|
| 0:42:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| It's December 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| It is the PNC variable-rate loan and then the U.S. Bank variable-rate loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| This particular picture, I remember having this discussion last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| is that to try to evaluate and monitor this exposure is critical because the banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| we've seen their ratings move and become more volatile in comparison to the public entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| And that is translated into the rating agencies actually look at the public entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| and figure out how much exposure do you have to a particular bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| And on the back end, we know that they're also looking at the underlying rating of these banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| which are nowhere near the caliber of the county's rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| So it's something for the county to continue to monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| One thing that I would recommend is that as the three BB&T letter of credits are set to expire June 30, 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| I would suggest that the county look to shop that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| and actually look at what the market is providing during that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| That market has actually come back in a little bit, and the cost of liquidity has become much more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| We've been through a similar process with Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| and we're going through a process with Hamilton County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| And both entities have been pleased with the cost of the liquidity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| in comparison to how they were a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| So I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on the next two slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| but just give you a snapshot as to what those five variable rate pieces of debt look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| On page 17, the two top are variable rate bonds, but with swaps associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| You will see the red line at the top represents where the swap rate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| The blue line at the bottom represents where the variable rate bonds have been trading in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| The good news is that when I went through this process back in 2008 and 2009 time frame with my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| there was lots of movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| That movement has subsided, and for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| all of the variable rate underlying bonds have been trading at very low rates, very attractive rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| with very little volatility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| The bottom chart does not have a C3A, does not have a swap with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| so you'll see there's no red line represented, but that is purely a variable rate bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| The two loans that we referred to on previous slides, you've got the D3As and the 6K1s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| You will see that that's where I actually refer to some of that volatility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| and that was related to the bank provider, the liquidity provider on those particular pieces of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| Once they were refinanced into these bank products, which was our percentage of LIBOR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| we saw that rate flatten out and become more, I guess, more manageable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| as opposed to being volatile and subject to whatever an investor requires when a rate resets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| Any questions on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| You want to talk about swaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| I'll let Alfred come up and talk through a couple of slides on swaps before we close up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2739)|
| 0:45:51| Thanks, Lauren, and thanks so much for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| It's an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| So we're going to go through a little bit of introduction on swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Hopefully we'll all be experts by the time we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| So we'll touch a little bit on that first, the introduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| and then go through the detail of the actual transactions for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| So what's an interest rate swap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| It's simply a contract between two parties, and they're called counterparties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| So they exchange interest rate payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| And usually most of our issuers, like Knox County, you're paying fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| receiving a floating or variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| And that variable rate is offsetting the variable on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| So together you're fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So when you have your swap and your bond, your variable bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| really it's like issuing fixed rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| So that's really what 80% to 90% of our clients really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| So the interest rate payments for a given counterparty are pretty much the same as the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| So the swap notional matches the principle of the bonds so that they all go in tandem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| And so the picture here you see of counterparty A and counterparty B is just the swap itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| where you're paying fixed, receiving float,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| counterparty B, BB&T, could be Lehman Brothers, could be Goldman, whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| and you're paying that fixed rate on a notional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| and receiving floating on that same notional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| And, of course, hopefully you're going to put the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| And so the next slide explains what the swap floating rate indices are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| LIBOR, London Interbank Offered Rate, that's the taxable index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| That's where banks borrow and lend to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| So the variable swap rate will pay floating on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| And it's because the variable debt is tax-exempt, so you'll want to take a percentage of LIBOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| if you want to match your variable debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| So a lot of folks will do a percentage of LIBOR swap instead of the full LIBOR because LIBOR is taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| So since you're hedging or you're having that swap face a tax-exempt piece of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| you will want a percentage of LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Otherwise, you could do a SIFMA variable swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| And what is SIFMA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| That's a tax-exempt index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| So SIFMA is an index that's comprised of about 200 variable rate issuances out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| They collate, they take all these 200 issues out there, they get an average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| and that index that you get every day is SIFMA, and you could do a swap on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| Any questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| What's AMT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| It says non-AMT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Well, this is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| This refers to what the bonds are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| So if an issuer's credit is strong and the bonds are not AMT, I'm just not familiar with what the AMT is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| Alternative minimum tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Alternative minimum tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Yeah, so this is just explaining that you could use SIFMA index to manage your tax-exempt debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2960)|
| 0:49:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| So now the next slide, this shows you how the swap actually works with the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2973)|
| 0:49:42| So the county, you've converted a portion of your variable floating rate debt to a synthetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| Why is it called synthetic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Because you've layered on that swap, and it's just like issuing a regular fixed-rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| Because when you take your swap together with your variable debt, which is right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| the borrower knocks county, you have your bondholders, you're paying variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| you put on your variable swap where you pay fixed, receive variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| The swap counterparty is Morgan Keegan in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| As a result, when you net everything, you're paying a fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Just like you issued fixed-rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Well, that's the theory of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Then you have the ancillary fees, which is remarketing and liquidity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| And then you can see here, if you're paying a fixed rate of 356 for 20 years or 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| you have your variable, but net together with your swap and your variable debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| you have a synthetic fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Any questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| These boxes and arrows are the essence, really, of what pretty much almost everybody is doing swaps out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3045)|
| 0:50:54| Questions to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Who's paying the – who's the payer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| It's not the letter of credit that people use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| It's not BB&T or P&C, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| Yeah, if we go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| So the fixed payer is Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| Okay, so you're paying fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Then we receive a payment from a counterparty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| You receive a variable swap payment from your counterparty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| Who's the counterparty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Morgan Keegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Morgan Keegan, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| So Morgan Keegan is the counterparty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| So the lingo is counterparty because you're counter on the contract, on the swap contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| So you receive that on the variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| and you're hoping that variable rate on the swap offsets the variable on the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| and then together it's fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| So this picture here is pretty important because it also shows where risks are when you do swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| If that squiggly line up there doesn't match the squiggly line going to the bondholders, there's a mismatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3107)|
| 0:51:54| If the ancillary fees you see there, the remarketing fees and the liquidity fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| if those are changing or increasing, that's another exposure for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| So that's – and that we can talk about later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Let's go to GASB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| The Governmental Accounting Standards Board required all swaps to be put on the balance sheets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| or Statement of Net Assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| This is about five years ago they decided to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| All derivatives must be on a government's Statement of Net Assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| The second thing you have to do is you need to evaluate these swaps or hedges for effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| The third thing is you need to recognize the changes in fair value of those swap contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| So if they qualify for hedge accounting, whatever negative amount you get on the swap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| you get a new line item on your Statement of Net Assets of a deferred inflow or a deferred outflow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| and then you don't have any effect on revenues or Statement of Activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| So you get an offset to your swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| If you test for hedge accounting and the swap does not qualify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| then it is deemed an investment instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| And you take your – the cumulative gains and losses on the swap get booked in your Statement of Activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| And once a swap is deemed an investment instrument, it cannot go back to being a hedge on the same bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3209)|
| 0:53:37| So you can see what Gatsby was trying to do because swaps used to be off-balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| In fact, you just disclose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| You just look at the mark-to-market to report it as a footnote disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| But by bringing them on to the Statement of Net Assets, now you're reporting them on the financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| And by pairing the swap with the bond, they're making sure the accounting –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| they're trying to make the accounting of a swap and synthetic debt be just like regular fixed-rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| So that's why you get the offset on the deferred inflow and deferred outflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| So that was the concept of Gatsby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| And if there is a benefit – if there is a benefit on a swap or a loss on a swap and it's not a hedge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3257)|
| 0:54:29| then the profit and loss gets recorded on a Statement of Activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| So they're trying to make sure all issuers have – whenever a swap is done, it's usually done with a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| So they're trying to make that through the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| Questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| That single slide, I think, summarizes about 90 pages of the Gatsby Statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3289)|
| 0:54:59| All right, so we're going to review the actual swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| And so you have three transactions or three swaps, hedging series C1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| The county pays fixed 3.946.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| You're receiving 63.2 percent of five-year LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| So every floating rate that gets set on this swap, you receive 63.2 percent of five-year LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| And this swap terminates in June 1, 2029.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| The counterparty is Morgan Keegan Financial Products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| The mark-to-market value of this swap is 11.399 million as of March 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3336)|
| 0:55:44| All right, so as Lauren showed, when you have your synthetic fixed rate, it's 3.946.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| That's what's being paid all the way till maturity of the swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| And as long as the bonds match the floating rate, then net your fixed 3.946 on series C1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3354)|
| 0:56:05| Series A1 there, same thing, 3.395, receiving 59.0 of five-year LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| You also receive 63.5-year LIBOR on the 3.89 swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| The mark-to-market of all those right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| The mark-to-markets are produced on a platform that we've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| It's called SwapViewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| So the monitoring is done constantly by management just so that you have your arms around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| If Morgan Keegan gets upgraded or downgraded, that management gets notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| If they want the mark-to-markets as of close of business tonight, management can call us up and it's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| It's also online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| So the valuations and the monitoring, they're done by the same engines that PFM uses to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| and put in place all these transactions for our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| So management has access to these same models and this same technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3415)|
| 0:57:04| You don't post collateral, but that's something else we do for clients, but ratings, we do monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| Questions on these slides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| Let's go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Well, so this is a screenshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| This is actually going online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| This would be what Melanie or the folks online go, this is what they'd see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| So you're able to see what the series is on each transaction and the total mark-to-market is 35.6 million as of March 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3456)|
| 0:57:45| So whatever the prevailing market was as of March 18, that drives the mark-to-market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| So the fixed rate of 3.5 or 3.94, the fixed rate of 3.395, the fixed rate of 3.89 is a contractual obligation by Knox County to pay until 2029.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3473)|
| 0:58:07| We present value those back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Same thing, we present value the expected payments from Morgan Keegan until 2029 on all the swaps and these are the net values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3490)|
| 0:58:21| A conceptual way of thinking about it is if you have a fixed rate bond and rates fall, where would the bond be trading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| It would be trading over par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| And so the net, so this mark-to-market represents the value of this synthetic rate debt versus the prevailing interest rates as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3511)|
| 0:58:50| Questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| So this is where the swap payments are actually tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| They are also tracked online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| So management can independently verify what the counterparty, Morgan Keegan, is paying or supposed to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3540)|
| 0:59:09| So not only do we compute the mark-to-markets, but we compute the floating rate payments of the swap each and every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| So this screenshot here just shows the rates and the amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| So for example, five-year LIBOR will set, if we go to November, there's a fixing date, November 29, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3563)|
| 0:59:33| We can see the rate reset of percentage of LIBOR on this day was 0.48664.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| We capture that every single time it's ready, put online, and then the payment is computed ready for folks to look at for Knox County on these transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3581)|
| 0:59:53| So then that's done all the way until maturity of the swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| Questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| And now this, some boxes and arrows here, looks a little busy, but really it shows the whole strategy for these transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3600)|
| 1:00:16| If you put your eyes on the pay fixed, 3.946, 3.395, 3.89, that's what we are paying Morgan Keegan on the swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3616)|
| 1:00:28| And I didn't explain before why on earth are we receiving five-year LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| I was hoping somebody will ask that, so I will say why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| And you can see the reason is the floating payments are set on a five-year rate while we're paying a variable rate, which is very short-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3639)|
| 1:00:50| So every month the swaps receive on a five-year rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| And then you can see we try to capture the benefit to Knox on the swaps because you're receiving a little bit more than you're paying on the floating rate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3654)|
| 1:01:09| So that's a net benefit that management expected to accrue on these swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| And that you can see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| So the borrower, that's the net benefit there, and you're paying a variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| So you can see the difference between those two is the expected net benefit because you're receiving a percentage of a higher rate than what you're paying on your variable debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3684)|
| 1:01:36| Questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| We receive money via the LIBOR rate, not pay money via the LIBOR rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| Yes, you're receiving via LIBOR a percentage of five-year on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3704)|
| 1:01:52| And then you're paying your bondholders variable, but it's reset, it's a weekly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| So you're paying variable based on a weekly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Although you're receiving every month from Morgan Keegan, the rate is being set on a five-year rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3724)|
| 1:02:15| So then that's why the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| So it's actually a benefit because we expect, folks expect five-year LIBOR to be higher, or five-year rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| Just like a 10-year mortgage, the rate is usually higher than a 30-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| And a five-year is going to be lower than a 10-year, but definitely higher than a one-month rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| So that's the thing with swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| You can customize them and receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| So in this case, it's receiving based on a five-year rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| When you first mentioned the LIBOR, I wondered if the controversy or manipulation, actually, of LIBOR, or alleged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3767)|
| 1:02:56| had any effect on the rates we pay, but may have had an effect on the rate we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| Would that be right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| The manipulation would have affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| If you were receiving a short-term, because in your case, it may have been very, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| It went up, it wouldn't have paid us more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| So if it went up, you get more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| If it went down, then you don't receive as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| But then in this case, the LIBOR that you're receiving is based on a five-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| That was overnight, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| The manipulation that they're alleging is on the overnight LIBORs and the short-term LIBORs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| So in your case, it's a little bit, it's based on a five-year LIBOR, so probably it's not going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| you were not as affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| Questions on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| So let me explain what these bullet points are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Let's just stick back to the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| I figured, yeah, so the rates, again, so the rates that are based on the LIBOR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| the five-year LIBOR, they're expected to outperform the variable rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| because the variable bond rates are based on short-term tax exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| So that net benefit, of course, is regard to the variable payments, as I've just explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3852)|
| 1:04:20| Now, remember GASB 53, which I explained, where you're supposed to test your swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| to see whether it matches the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| So in other words, if you look at that yellow line, GASB is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| if you put on a swap, the yellow line, the yellow squiggly line that you get from your swap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| it better match what you're paying on the variable debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| They want them to match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| What if it's a benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| It's deemed an investment instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| And then, so it's recorded as a statement of net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| even though there's outperformance, which is to the benefit of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| it's deemed an investment instrument under GASB 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| So that's something I wanted to explain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| So at least it's outperformance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| There are folks who underperform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| You know, when LIBOR, especially when LIBOR was very, very low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| and SIFMUK skyrocketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| And right now, they're matching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| But in your case, it continues to outperform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| And if we look at, now we can go to the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| This is my last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| So if you have any questions, think of some before I go off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| So this here is the description of the five-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| You can see the red line is 59% of LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| The green line is 63.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| And the short-term tax-exempt rates, that's SIFMUK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| which is the index I explained earlier of variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| which is probably what you're paying on your bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| You can see it's been lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| But at the height of the crisis, you can see it spiked horrendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| But then it's come back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| And since then, it's outperforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| The last thing I want to explain is the mark-to-markets before I get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| GASB had good intentions, and I think they made sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| because they're trying to have issuers match swaps and bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| A lot of times, the mark-to-markets, people just look at the mark-to-market alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| But forgetting it's always paired with a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| There's always a bond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| So for example, if you had issued fixed-rate debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| you'd be carrying your bonds at historical cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| The economics would be the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| So a lot of folks go to the news and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| ooh, my swap, look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| Forgetting there's always a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| However, if there were no bonds, then it's a real risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| when you just have the swap alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Or sometimes folks will do a swap in anticipation of doing a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| And then they didn't do the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| And you're still stuck with that contract in low rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| So those are the real risks that swaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| that our clients face, which you don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| But still, it gets asked time and time again of boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| And so these are the things that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Your swaps have bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| The risk that people face is when they're not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| or you thought you were going to have your bonds and they're not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| and then you're faced with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Or you have your liquidity and you're trying to manage it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| and, boy, I got to issue fixed-rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| You issue fixed, you still have your swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| If you issue fixed, then really you should not have that swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| So those are the general risks that folks face on swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| And in your case, I would say even though it's a mark-to-market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| that's significant, you still have your bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| And I'll hand over to Lauren. Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| I've got just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| A general question on swaps there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| About $200 million in swaps of our underlying debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| A little over $300 million in variable, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| which as long as interest rates are low, I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| The swaps, and Chris and I talk about this all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| we've got them for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| It looks like, what, 16 years or two, and then the last one, 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| And we were always comparing ourselves to our peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| other cities, city of Knoxville, other cities, other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| And, of course, the poster child four hours down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Miami, Alabama, you know, not that much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| I guess 300,000 more, 200,000 more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| But the swaps there, and it may be what you were referencing a minute ago about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4151)|
| 1:09:18| maybe the swap, that was just the game there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| I don't know. I know there was a sewer issue that tanked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| and corruption charges, and indictments, and people in prison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| and all those other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| But nevertheless, it's bankrupted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| And weren't swaps at the core of that, or maybe not the core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| but swaps were part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Part of it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| They were part of the whole disaster there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| They were part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| And what we found is, like in that particular swaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| especially before the crisis, and before Dodd-Frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| which does provide protections and representations and warranties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| that banks are supposed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Before that, it was so tempting for banks to just come along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| get a good credit, and just sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| There's no up-front money paid up front, and just do the swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| In their case, you'll probably find more than one swap with a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| Like layering on swap upon swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| And essentially, you become over-levered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| You become over-leveraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| Because when the mark-to-market...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| So right now, it's like you issued debt, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| You issued synthetic fixed on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| But if you put another swap on top, it's like you borrowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| You're going to have the exposure of another borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| That's what happened there, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| It's just layering, layering on top of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Yes, it's just layering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Just essentially layering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| I'm not sure they had the knowledge they were doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| And when you're layering it on when the expectation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| hey, maybe rates will go up anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| then really it's a speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| So, yes, it's been painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| My last comment, and I want to make sure I'm reading this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| We had this DEPFA, D-E-P-F-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| Isn't that a Norwegian or a Belgian bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| that sort of had too much Greek debt or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| And had been replaced by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| I think it's German.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| German? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| But been replaced by PNC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| As the letter of credit backer for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| A lot of folks, I think you can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Yeah, you actually refinanced out of that debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| and you entered into a variable rate bank loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| to make it very simple with PNC Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| The PNC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Yes, and that was, in fact, when we spoke to you in March of 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| we spoke to you about the DEPFA exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| And they were exiting the business, weren't they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| of the LLCs for swaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| And so PNC picked up the whole 71 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| And so you refinanced the underlying variable rate bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| and entered into a variable rate loan with PNC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| How did U.S. Bank come into the picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| They're in for 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| They did another piece of the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Same mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Refinanced it out of the variable rate bond market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| and into a variable rate bank loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| So the attractive feature of those is that you don't have investors, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| You have one bank to keep happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| You understand the terms of the contract on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| And banks have really started pursuing these options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| because the letter of credit market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| doesn't make as much sense for them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| They had to commit the capital anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| And the returns, meaning the premiums they were getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| for committing their capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| were significantly below what they could actually put that money to work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| So they would rather invest the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| meaning that they actually become the investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| and loan you the money outright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| than go through the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| and there's a lot of credit issues associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| if you're going to commit the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| but the return is significantly below market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| it's hard to get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| I can see it's so much easier for us to have one bondholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| instead of 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Correct. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Oh, before I forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| I want to refer you also to the appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We put quite a bit of material in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| PFM, our company, we offer training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| And I put some material in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| from a recent training that we had for client training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| So there's some good material in there on swamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| And I'll close and then we'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| You can move on to your other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Just in closing remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| the county's credit has continued to be very, very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| In fact, I would say that it actually has improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| since I was here in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| There's a lot of attractive components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| of being a Knox County resident in regards to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| and the portion of the tax rate that's attributed to debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| The county's credit rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| the strong AA1, AA+,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| should be considered as very valuable in this market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| even more so than five or six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| There are very few recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| that I would speak to you on as well as administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| Most of them relate to considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| with synthetic fixed rate debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| or variable rate debt in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| that you continue to monitor the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| of the considerations associated with outstanding debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| and any future debt that the county may consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| Obviously, we will continue to monitor sequestration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| and as that 8.7% changes in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| or is increased or decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| we will certainly work with administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| to make sure that they're on the forefront of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| and understanding what the county's exposure is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| to that additional interest cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| And lastly, the three BB&T letter of credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| because that market has improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| I think that as you get closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| to the expiration date in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| that the county look to other providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| or at least evaluate in the cost of those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| in hopes of reducing the overall cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| associated with the variable rate debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| and the letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| The current facilities all expire on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| I also think that there should be a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| to diversifying the expiration date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| having all of them come due on one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| from the rating agency's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| will be considered almost having all of your eggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| in one basket type of approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| But all in all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| the county's credit has actually, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| improved and continued to prevail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| given the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| And I'm here for any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| We're in debt $667 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| To get the better rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| what do you see our indebtedness need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| to get the very top rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| If we're trying to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| knock down about $20 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| I think that some of it may be economic driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| that the economy's going to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| and however it's going to move in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| It hasn't worsened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| I don't think it's significantly improved either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| It's not, there's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Volkswagen down the street in Knox County, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| However, and it's specifically related to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| who are in debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| it's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| it's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| it's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| however, and it's specifically related to the debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| I think if the county continues to pay down their debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| as rapidly as you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| I think if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| if there's any way to reduce the exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| on these variable rate pieces of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I think from the debt perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| you're singing a song| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| that is very much in line with the AAA community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| and that you should continue to push the rating agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| to recognize how strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| the county's debt portfolio is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| and the management of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| Do we need to get below $500 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| or give me a ballpark figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Well, I would, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| I don't think you actually can give a ballpark figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| I don't think it's a specific dollar amount at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| because it speaks to the tax base that can repay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| I think paying the debt off faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| which is a little bit of a situation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| is that you have debt schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| that you pay your bondholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| a principal and interest schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| The rating agencies speak that it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| you don't pay it off as quick as some of your comparables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| That's a little bit challenging to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| when the debt's already out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| meaning it's not like your mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| that you can just prepay it at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| They don't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| I think that the way you offset that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| or mitigate that perception of the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| doesn't get paid off as fast as some of the comparables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| is in new debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| The way you hit it is that you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| paying the debt off before 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| maybe doing a 15-year structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| or level principal is the other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| to pay off debt faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| Certain places within Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| do 15-year and level principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Some do 20-year level principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| There's a couple of ways of structuring that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| but I think that speaks to the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| of wanting to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Kind of speaking directly to the rating agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| and saying, we understand you don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| we pay it off fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| This is how we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| I mean, to me it sounds like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| and I tend to agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| there's no magic number that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| if we get to $300,000 or $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| magic's going to happen in the bonding agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| I mean, you know, by that same token,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| looking at the property tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| please, no one says Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| is endorsing a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| But, you know, if we went up to Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| we could probably get some of those pay down numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| and we could make our debt service percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| could improve drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| So is that kind of a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| and I think it actually speaks to the comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| that I just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| is that that's actually the rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| that I think an analyst goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| is they say, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| when we lie up the property tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| in comparison to other communities in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| knowing that if it was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| that you wanted to do, you could do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| but maybe that's not the best use of your funds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Maybe you actually use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| in form of a pay go for capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| or whatever expenditures you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| But actually having that flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| speaks volumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| as opposed to being in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| where you're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| almost living fiscal year to fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| And, you know, I guess I'll make my two-minute soapbox speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| And that's kind of where I come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| I think we're in great shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| in terms of where we stand today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| I don't think we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| probably in this environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| with the way we're operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| we're probably not going to get to AAA rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| which isn't a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| It's not a bad thing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| I don't think it's going to benefit us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| having a few basis points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| is always going to benefit us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| in terms of a favorable interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| I would agree that we often say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| there is a cost associated with being a AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| I mean, there is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| there's some considerations of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| that you give up to be that AAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| and maybe you make a conscious decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| not to give those opportunities up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| just for the sake of being a AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| Okay, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Thank you, Ms. Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Thank you, Mr. Micuña.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Excellent presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Even excited a couple of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| And those of us that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| a little more financially challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| we hung in there tough as long as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| We've got several people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| who want to speak on the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| of backcountry fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| and a proposal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| to increase fees or levy fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| on backcountry permits for camping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| So, we'll go ahead with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| The first one that I have on my list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| is Myers Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| I'm Myers Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| I appreciate you all considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I think it's sort of appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| to follow the budget that you're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| and how well you all handled it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| to keep the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| as high as we can get practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| And on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| we've got a federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| that's not doing anywhere close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| And we want to point out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| that they're out of control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| they're spending money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| and they're trying to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| And on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| we have a national park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| a treasure, a creature of statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| an entity that the law says exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| and has existed for 70-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| For free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| have been able to go walk through the mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| set a tent up on a relatively flat spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| filter water out of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| and use the restroom out in the woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| dig a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| And there's nothing provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| And it's for 70 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| it's been free and unimpaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| And then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| it's one thing on front country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| like Elmont, Cataloochee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| and places where they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| tent spots, they have trash removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| they have water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| they have flat tent spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| they have restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| You expect to pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Those are services that the National Park Service provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| and you expect to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| But in the back country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| all there are are bear cables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| that are in the tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| where you hang your packs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| to keep the bears from getting your packs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| But the citizens of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| through purchasing license plates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| through the Friends of the Great Smokies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| don't have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| So, what the out-of-control federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| is trying to figure out a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| And on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| we've got backpackers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| who are not using anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| but what God gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| and they're wanting to charge us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| to do what's been free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| for 70 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| And we just request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| that Knox County make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| that we don't think that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| And Knox County is a very important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Colonel Chapman is named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| and it's the road from Knoxville to the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| He's the one that led the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| He was the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| or the chairman of the Tennessee Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| who, for a dozen years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| did this and got it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| And it's just wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| to charge backpackers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| when we don't use anything but the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| And we appreciate you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| considering this very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Mr. Morton, would you give your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| I'm sorry I didn't ask you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| 847 Knight Road at 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Thank you, Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| Next, Wendy Lesmaresis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| I'm sorry I butchered that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| You can correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| and give your name also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Wendy, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Wendy Lesmaresis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| 1332 Woodridge Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Dear Knox County Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| I'm a Knox County resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| and educator who was born| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| and raised in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| I've grown up hiking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| camping, and backpacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| in the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| I took time off from college in 1995| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| to spend six and a half months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| hiking the Appalachian Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| And I'm grateful that I was able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| to take the time to walk from Georgia to Maine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| to figure out what I wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| with the rest of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| And I'm so grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| I'm married with a child now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| and I've waxed poetic so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| to my family about how hiking the trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| was such a life-changing experience for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| that my husband, son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| father-in-law, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| plan to hike the AT in sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| And I hope that I can share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| this experience with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| The first section of the AT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| that I would like to introduce to my son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| would be the Smokies, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| where we would be hiking on trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| that are largely maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| by volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| And yes, sometimes we'll be sleeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| in tents, sometimes we'll be sleeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| in shelters that are also built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| by volunteers with money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| raised by donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| During this information age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| where life is moving so fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| where we are constantly stressed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| trying so hard to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| with the demands of each day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| I'm so glad that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| such a beautiful place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| to which we can escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I'm not paying a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| when I go camping with my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| and use the bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| and other amenities at a campground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| But the backcountry should be a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| for anyone to be able to escape to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| for a night, a weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| or a long-distance hike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| across the country for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| whether you are a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| a college student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| or a troop of Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| This was the original vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| of the National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| This was what was promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| to our ancestors by President Roosevelt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| when the park was dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Please support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| backcountry fee resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| and make sure that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| gets to experience the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| backcountry that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| one that has always been free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| from distraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| free from technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| free from stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| and most importantly, free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Next, Eric Gearhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Again, Mr. Gearhart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| just your name and address to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Eric Gearhart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| 319 Chowning Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| First off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| I want to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| for the opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Again, I'm Eric Gearhart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Knox County resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| as well as a backcountry volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| in Great Smoky Mountains National Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| participating in both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| the Adopt-A-Trail and Adopt-A-Campsite programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| I'm approaching 2,500 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| of volunteer service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| again, all in the backcountry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Some 20-odd years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| when I was a UT student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| I became hopelessly obsessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| with the landscapes of southern Appalachia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| Had such a fee been in place back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| even though gas was only a buck a gallon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| I would have had difficulty paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| for one quarter of the days and nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| I spent becoming intimately familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| with the forests, ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| and drainages within the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| It was a challenging period for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| And as the years have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| I feel like it's been a win-win situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| both for myself and the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| that I was never discouraged by fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| from experiencing in depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| the freedom of making do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| of doing without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| of emulating in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| our forebearers and nature itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Even if at times such insights were gained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| as Knoxvillian Harvey Broome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| once stated so perfectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| by being freed from the possibility of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| That is often the essence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| of my volunteer work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| been the product of wanting to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| and give back to this place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| which has so inspired me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| but also wanting to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| the perfectly democratic access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| No entrance fees, no parking fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| no backcountry camping fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| all of which I have so appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I've spoken with many other volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| especially backcountry volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| who like myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| cite the no-fee system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| as one of the foremost reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| why we, which until February 13th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| had remained faithful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| to the original National Park concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| as well as the Smokies' own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| understood agreement of forever free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| a promise widely offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| during the difficult park creation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| The administrators in our federal agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| seem to often think of the lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| they oversee not as ours, but as theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| which they then sell to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| The following sums up the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| we've been heading for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| They are the words of the U.S. Forest Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| first ever Chief Operating Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| Francis Pandolfi, in 1999, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| Have we fully explored our goldmine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| of recreational opportunities in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| and managed it as if it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| consumer product brands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| How could it be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| As federal agencies and others transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| from providing outdoor recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| at no cost to the consumer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| to charging for access and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| we can expect to see many changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| in the way we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| Selling a product, even to an eager customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| doesn't stop them from giving it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Such is frequently the mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| when it comes to our public lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| In Great Smoky Mountains National Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Superintendent Dale Dittmanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| when discussing his initial desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| to outsource his new, overwhelmingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| unpopular backcountry reservation system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| to a Canadian company, recreation.gov,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| espoused the one-stop shopping benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| And throughout his sales pitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| over the last 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| those who live around the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| where families were forced to surrender their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| have been repeatedly referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| not as descendants, not as taxpaying owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| not even as visitors, but as customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Of course, he lumped all other Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| in that category as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| and continues to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| At the recent Blount County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| the superintendent made no mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| of the fee's cure-all capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| as in previous interviews and press releases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| but instead merely suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| that his new system improved customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| More accurately, it expanded customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| If you wish to improve the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| of the so-called customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| you minimize, simplify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| or eliminate the need for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| That was the case previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| for 80% of the backcountry campsites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| were once simply self-registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| It couldn't have been more simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| It couldn't have been more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| This is nothing but government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| becoming more expansive, more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| In addition, when a government agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| proceeds full steam ahead, undeterred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| after 95% of public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| come down in opposition to the plan put forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| such an agency has conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| over a three-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| a far cry from any sort of civic engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| or public comment inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| And it should be noted that those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| were buried and completely misrepresented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| by Park Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| until a Freedom of Information Act request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| revealed the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Another Freedom of Information Act request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| revealed that the Park Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| could only produce seven comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| over a three-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| that addressed a problem getting through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| on the backcountry reservation phone line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| one of the primary justifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| for the lack of public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| In addition, there are more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| 130,000 annual backpackers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| That's one documented complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| about the phone center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| for every 12,857 backcountry users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| who secured a permit without comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| The deceit and disregard is unfortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| to say the least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| when one considers the unique assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| available to this particular park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| I can find no publishing partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| which donated more in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| to support its park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| than Great Smoky Mountains Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| donating more than $2 million annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| Mr. Gerhart, we have put a five-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Could you wrap up your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| Just to reiterate what others have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| in that the volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| and the support groups oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| have been the ones who have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| the majority of the work in the backcountry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| and that volunteers themselves last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| donated 161,913 hours of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| and that with a $64 million federal stimulus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| there was never a mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| of this so-called backcountry crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| Instead, only after $64 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| had been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| did this issue arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| So I appreciate very much your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| I hope that you'll follow suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| with Blount County, Bradley County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| Monroe County in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| as well as Swain County in North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| to condemn the fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and demand their immediate repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| And we thank you so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Thank you, Mr. Gerhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| David Skidmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5579)|
| 1:33:14| Hello, my name is David Skidmore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| and I live at 1944 Emmerlin Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| I moved to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| to go to law school in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| And I got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| I think it was a Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| and I had some nice guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| invite me to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| a University of Tennessee football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| And I had a really good time that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| And the next weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| I had some nice guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| invite me to go on a hike in the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| And I had a wonderful time that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| And after those two weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| I decided Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| was a pretty good place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| And since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| I've gone to a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| University of Tennessee football games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| And I've developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| an almost sacred attachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| to the backcountry and the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| I have been hiking in the Smokies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| And about 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| I met some like-minded people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| and we started backpacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| And I've been out there many weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| and when I first heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| that they were instituting a fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| I wanted to hear the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Now, I know the national parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| have been underfunded for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| and that's been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| But I wanted to hear about the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| And what I heard was two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Number one, that the backcountry was overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| And since I'm out there quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| I know that if you get about a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| from the trailhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| you'll very seldom see a soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| So I had a hard time believing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| And I haven't gone through the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| like a lot of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| but I had a hard time believing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| I also heard that the backcountry was trashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| I have been out to almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| every backcountry site in the Smokies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| and I have never seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| a backcountry spot trashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| Backpackers are the most conscientious users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| of the backcountry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| And I think it's terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| that they are being discriminated against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| for the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| the purpose of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| is to set up the reservation system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| for the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| As other people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| this is public land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| and it should be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| to use by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| These backcountry sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| are unimproved sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| I walk a trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| to a spot in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| I put up a tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| I make my own food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| I find out much more trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| than I've ever carried into those woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| And over the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| since the beginning of this controversy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| over this fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| a lot of people have said to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| well, this is your fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| This is you and your friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| the backcountry campers' fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| But I think it's everybody's fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| If you believe the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| should be responsive to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| this is your fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| If you believe public land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| should be open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| this is your fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| And I would urge you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| to pass this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| condemning the backcountry fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| and the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Thank you, Mr. Skidmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Gordon Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| Some of you may have met Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| He was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| He's also a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| in Flint County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| So welcome, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| My name is Gordon Wright Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| and I live at 6268 East Lamar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| Alexander Parkway in Wallen, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| And I also serve as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| which encompasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| the Great Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| I have been reared my entire life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| on the hills of the Smoky Mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| of which my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| and home place now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| at Backwoods Campsite No. 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| The thing I wish today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| is to go back in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| and just bear with me a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| We're going to talk about a young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| that fought in a revolutionary war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| He was 15 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| He was left for dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| on the battlefield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| He fought for mining your freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| That young man at that particular time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| was no more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Colonel Fightin' Billy Tipton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| I am his grandson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| about four or five generations back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| That's my grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| He was one of the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| well actually he was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| one of the first settlers in Cades Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| Now, Colonel Billy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| acquired this land by land grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| And it's very well documented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| documented in anywhere you want to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| Now, his relatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| including mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| were promised several things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| when the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| took over the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| They promised they wouldn't be evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| They were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| They were kicked off their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| They spent a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| because that was not only their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| but their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| They were promised things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| to some of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| who opted to stay there under lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| They were promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| that there would be no restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| The federal government went back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| And some of the other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| like eviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| promised they wouldn't be evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Well, they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| And they were also promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| there would not be any fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| for use of that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| And commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| this is nothing more than taxation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| without representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Normally I wouldn't become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| this emotionally involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| but this is hitting close to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| And I'm sick and tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| of the arrogance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| of the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| of the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| I'll just be right up front with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| I would appreciate your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| to pass this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| One other point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| Not only is it a Mr. Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| thank you for being here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| He also sits in seat 8B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| not just the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| but in the B seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| which is where I was elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| But you're not related, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Do we have any other people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| for public forum who wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6027)|
| 1:40:35| Name and address again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| My name is John Quillen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| in 3701 Lancaster Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| I appreciate the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| taking up this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Some hard acts to follow over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| especially with Mr. Wright and Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| But one thing that Eric and I have in common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| is that we're what the Park Service calls VIPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| That stands for Volunteer in the Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| And Eric does more volunteer work than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| I don't do as much as I would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| but I do what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| And we're pretty important to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| except for when it comes to issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| about park usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| And in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| we couldn't be any less important to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| The public comments about this fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| were 18 to 1 against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| And so we approached the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| and he arrogantly dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| the public comments saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| well, most people didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I took great offense to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| And for the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| our coalition has been fighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| to the nail to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| As a park volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| I think I should be important enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| to have a voice in the whole procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| and I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| You talk about families being displaced from the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| 1,200 families lost their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| as a result of the creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| I've been contacted by a lot of those families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| And like Mr. Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| they're pretty upset about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| Some people have called us freeloaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| I want to characterize something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| This fee goes to fund a reservation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| No real good things that you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| would be used for a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| are ever going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| There's no campsite maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| There's no trail maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| There's no leveling of tent spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| It goes to fund a reservation system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| and a reservation system only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| a reservation system that we voted against 18 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Again, the superintendent didn't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| about our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| He marched blindly on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| We even tried to have a meeting with him at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| And Adam and I, a guy over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| were in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| And our stipulation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| we're not going to talk about the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| Well, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| I thought that's why we were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| He wanted us to talk about the implementation of the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Well, we didn't necessarily follow his rules on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| And the meeting didn't end as he wanted it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| or as we wanted it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| because we were asking to make some concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| For instance, what about Boy Scout groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| Are you going to make a concession for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| I was a Boy Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| What about senior citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Do national parks do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| He said, nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| What about veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| We had a veteran in our group there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| And he looked at them and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| we're not making any deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Well, if other national parks did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| I don't see why the Great Smoky Mountains National Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| But I think it has to do with the arrogance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| of the administration over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| He said the Smoky Mountains wasn't special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| It was just another unit in the national park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| If that gives you a little indication of the drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| that all of us bring to this fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| I know the Smokies is special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| It's not another unit in the national park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| It's the people's park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Franklin Delano Roosevelt stood at Newfound Gap in 1940| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| but there is another danger from without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| that I hope the Smokies will not face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| that 100 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| it will belong to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| not in theory but in practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| of free people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| that they will not be told to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| on government-specified days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| on government-specified tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Well, 100 years hasn't passed since that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Within weeks of them approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| the backcountry camping fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| they were charging people to see fireflies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| FDR knew what he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| The Tennessee State Legislature knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| what they were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| when they put a deed restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| on Newfound Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| They said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| we'll give you the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| but what you can't do is charge our citizens to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| That's why there is no entrance fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| The foresight of the Tennessee State Legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| It's our elected officials that will represent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| and I'm beseeching this elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| to represent us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| in the face of the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Stand up to them and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| you didn't give them a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| but we're going to vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| And we don't stand for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| We're protecting our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| We're protecting the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| And that's what I'm asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| I appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| I think you're going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| And I appreciate your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| in taking on this very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| Thank you, Mr. Quon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| I'm sorry I skipped over you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| I had you down in print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| and I overlooked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| There was also another name, Adam Beal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| Is Adam here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Adam, would you like to please come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| My name is Adam Beal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| I live at 2941 Country Meadows Lane in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| I appreciate you letting me speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| even though I'm a resident of Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I do have a lot of ties to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| and I'm a scout leader for the PAC-19 in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| And I wanted to speak on behalf of my scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| and all the family members I have that live in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| And my wife, Amanda, and my son, Jack, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| backpack and go into the backcountry a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| do a lot of volunteer work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| and we're in the Smoky Mountain Hiking Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| which is also another institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| that came out of the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| And we all think it's very appropriate for the commission here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| to be considering this resolution since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| if it wasn't for the likes of people like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| Willis and Ann Davis and Colonel David Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| and Mayor Ben Morton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| if it wasn't for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| there probably wouldn't be a great Smoky Mountain National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| So we owe you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| We owe you a great deal of thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| And we feel our freedom is being taken away right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| and we're being penalized for being locals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| and living in this area near the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| If you live up in Ohio and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| maybe come to the Smokies once or twice a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| then the $4 doesn't really seem like a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| $4 a night per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| But when you're local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| and you have the opportunity and blessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| to be able to go frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| it's a much larger hindrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| If I take eight of my scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| for two nights into the backcountry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| that's going to cost $65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Now, with this new fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| previously, it would have been nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| And I could keep them in a front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| We could go to a front country campground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| for $40 a night for two nights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| $20 a night, so it would just cost $40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| It's actually cheaper to go in the front country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| than in the backcountry with this new fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| which is really ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| Resolutions like this help provide accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| that we didn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| With all the public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| and the input that we were given on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| with the Park Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| And for 78 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| the Smokies backcountry has been totally free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| for citizens to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| And I think we should strive to keep that legacy intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| for the park that was given to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| by the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| by the citizens to the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| with the dimes and pennies of schoolchildren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| from all over East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Thank you, Mr. Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| And thanks to all of those who came for public forum today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| We'll address this issue by resolution here in just a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| Do we have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6480)|
| 1:48:09| Do these two guys go with you on the camping trips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| My name is James Locke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| These are my sons, Sam and Thomas Locke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| We actually went on our first backcountry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| We live at 420 Ferret Road in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| We actually went on our first backcountry overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| or in January before the fees were enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| And we were very happy to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| And I was looking forward to spending much more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| And as far as the cost of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| it's not just the Boy Scout groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| that are going to have to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Some of the frontcountry sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| if I just go with my wife and children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| it's $16 a night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Some of the frontcountry sites are actually cheaper than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| So the typical family of four is now going to be affected more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| There aren't any facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| We volunteer in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| It's not really about the $4 per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| as it is the ideas of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| and the ideas of charging everybody for things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| that we've never had to charge before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| And it's just kind of disgraceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| You talked about previous generations of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| talking about how the park is such a big part of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| and fosters such great feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| And everybody wants to spend a lot of time there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| But will the next generations of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| get to really have this experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| I mean, today's culture is enough to kind of get kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| to be stuck in front of their video games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| And if we do things as a government to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| discourage these kind of behaviors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| I don't think that's what we want to do as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| And I'd like to thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Do we have anyone else that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6584)|
| 1:49:53| My name's Rob Cameron, 8931 Colchester Ridge Road, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| I'm not going to go over all the freedom we're losing like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| These guys have done a great job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| But one thing I would like to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| is another of the promises that the park made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| to people that lived there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| was that they would enjoy free access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| to the cemeteries and resting places of their ancestors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| Under the current administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| that has kind of gotten a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| it's not happening as it used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| And the reason I bring this up is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| in the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| I've put the ashes of my parents and my grandmother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| on top of Mount LeConte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| I'm still able at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| to make it up and down LeConte in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| But ten years from now, I'm not sure I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| And I'll have to pay, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| more than $4 in ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| to visit my parents and my grandmother's final resting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| I just feel that's totally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| And I appreciate you guys giving us a chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| Thank you, Mr. Cameron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| And I'll ask the commission permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| to move this item up in our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| for you all to hear that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| for those of you that want to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| I think it would be, Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| would it be okay if we take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| I think Mr. Brown's in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Was there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Let's take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| And be back at 335.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| Commissioners, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6702)|

| 1:53:00| If you would join me in prayer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6780)|

| 1:53:03| We thank you for the opportunity we have to live in a free country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| the opportunity we have to be an elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| to be here to discuss and to debate issues of concern to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6788)|

| 1:53:33| I pray for our legislature, our mayors here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6813)|

| 1:53:48| If you would stand, give proper salute to the nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6841)|
| 1:54:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Could I hear a motion to approve minutes of previous meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6852)|

| 1:54:19| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| I would like to move that item that all our folks from the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| without objection, could we move it up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Hearing no objection, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| I'd also like to we need to add item 902 back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6873)|
| 1:54:40| That's the judicial magistrates just for procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| So we'll add 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| And then we'd like to, given the discussion we had at the luncheon today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6887)|
| 1:54:54| let's discuss a date just as a discussion item, a date for our budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| So we'll do that at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| Yes, I'd like to take 904 off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| Okay, 904 is off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| Yes, I'd like just to add as a discussion item where we stand on the three ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| that deal with banning conventional billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| banning EMCs and Dr. Anders' ordinance because right now none of these companies can do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6926)|
| 1:55:33| because these are still outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| And just so we know where they are and then either we can start issuing permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| or find out where we are with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| That is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| Is that okay with you, Dr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| This past Saturday several commissioners attended an all-day Saturday small committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6953)|
| 1:56:01| or communities forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| Neighborhood conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| And if we have time before zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| I'd like for each commissioner that was in attendance maybe to think of a point that occurred during that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6969)|
| 1:56:17| to sort of pass on to the other commissioners that were unable to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| I'm offering this as if we have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| We'll put that in there as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| And also wanted to say thank you to Mr. Anders for covering for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| and chairing that meeting there on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Yes, Mr. Chairman, just as a personal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| I'm going to need to leave in about an hour or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| and it's not because I'm mad or upset at anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7001)|

| 1:58:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Let's go ahead and move 905 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| And we'll do that before we do the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| It's on page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| expressing support of resolution number 13-02-1008 of the Blount County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7118)|
| 1:58:47| to oppose the backcountry camping fee for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| to oppose the imposition of any fee to be for the use of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7131)|
| 1:58:58| that is not directly associated with the use of amenities or commercial purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| and to demand immediate repeal of the backcountry camping fee resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| Mr. Chairman, as former Eagle Scout, I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| You know, I discussed my concern with this resolution last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| And while I heard definitely compelling arguments from the folks that take advantage of that feature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7166)|
| 1:59:38| my view hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| And I guess it centers around the fact that, you know, since the inception of this country, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7181)|
| 1:59:49| I heard a lot of statements today about freedom, taking away our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| Freedom has never been free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| I mean, freedom comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I mean, we're paying billions of dollars for our freedom in this tumultuous world which we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| And I guess I also heard comments about, you know, it's a zero-sum game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7205)|
| 2:00:12| and that nothing is provided for the people that take advantage of this backcountry camping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7212)|
| 2:00:21| And I guess I disagree in that, you know, being ready to respond costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7221)|
| 2:00:30| We haven't had, thank goodness, at our airport in Blount County, we haven't had a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| serious event really since its, you know, founding and inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| But we're paying money to be prepared for an event, you know, crash landing or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| We're prepared for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| And similar with the, you know, the National Park folks that work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7251)|
| 2:01:01| Well, they say, well, it's just for reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Yes, but they're spending money out of this present budget for reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| And if there's a shortage, we're going to have to do something to deal with the shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7269)|
| 2:01:16| I dare say most national parks are compared to the Great Smoky Mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| which is the absolute best national park in the system, are charged per use, either by vehicle or by person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7282)|
| 2:01:32| So, you know, we're complying with the laws that the park was set up upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7292)|
| 2:01:40| But it can't be if it's free to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| It can't be it's free to visit for a 90-year-old and a 12-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| There has to be limitations, I guess is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| So, you know, as I look and dig into this, I just say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| what is the government's basic function in running the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| You know, I work at the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| I work for a contractor to the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| And I always tell folks, you know, it's a great national lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| We're doing great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| But it's not essential to the operation of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| Similar with the national parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| It's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| I mean, it's been my livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| And I've been a frequent user of our national park in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| But it's pork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| I mean, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| You know, I always say, I think Congressman Duncan said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| the War Memorial there at the World's Fair Park, you know, it's kind of pork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| Some pork's good and some pork's bad for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| So, you know, but this is a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| It's an extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| And it's a great extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| But when it comes down to its operation as these budgets tighten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| as you prepare for things that are evolving, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| communication has evolved over the last 30, 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| and it takes money to keep up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| And they still have to communicate, maybe not in the backcountry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| but they have to be prepared to make these rescues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| or just general maintenance and general operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| And there are some operations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| They might not be as great as the Sugarlands Visitor Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| but there are a great good amount of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| and maintenance that the park people have to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7401)|
| 2:03:25| So I guess I just look at it and I say, well, what's the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| There has to be a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| There's a cost to doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| And as we continue to evolve, things are tightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| Things are tightening up here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| When I came on the commission in 2008, we funded a good amount of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| I mean, there's probably 50 entities that we just don't fund anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| I mean, we've cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| We've cut and we've cut and we've cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| And we've heard some of the benefits of that cutting at our public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| And the same thing is going on at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| and the same thing is going on at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| So I guess with that, and lastly, I think we've done a good job of getting one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7442)|
| 2:04:10| But I think it would be fair for us to hear, because I've not heard personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| I've not heard that other than what I've read, the other side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| I would like to enter a substitute motion that we defer this to next month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| and give the folks from the National Park Service a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| and an opportunity to come in and present their side of why they've instituted these fees prior to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7471)|
| 2:04:39| you know, passing this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| So I'd like to enter that as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Now discussion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| For those individuals that spoke today, would you all please stand that spoke on this bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7495)|
| 2:05:01| this resolution here and the two young boys there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| As a Tennessee citizen and as a Boy Scout leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| I thank you for what you're doing to keeping our parks free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| and keeping our maintenance costs low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| Especially this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| You had some 2,500 hours, I think, that you said that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| That's how we get this park for free, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| is because these people like these go in, find a place, leave it better than what they found it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| and plus the man hours that they put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| So I just wanted to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| That's why we're called the Volunteer State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Anybody else on the substitute motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| It looks like we have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| Two yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| The remaining nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| So the substitution motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Any more discussion on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| This is a difficult resolution to speak for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7576)|
| 2:06:23| Last week, the work session, I thought, well, it's the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7583)|
| 2:06:31| But since then, and not including today, but since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| I've come to look at it in a little bit different light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| in that I'll use today's talks, though, to sort of illustrate where I've come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7598)|
| 2:06:46| This is not a for-free state park, excuse me, federal park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7606)|
| 2:06:55| It's not a for-free deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| As I've commented to Commissioner Andrews here just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| whenever the word free was entered, I said, well, I paid my income tax not too many days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7622)|
| 2:07:10| and I didn't relate this to Brad, but I had to pay money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| And I would say the same thing about Commissioner McKenzie's work at Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| I paid some money to fund Oak Ridge because that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7640)|
| 2:07:28| These are things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| You might say we do not need a Great Smoky Mountains National Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| but we've had people walk through and stand at the podium and say, it's property that was my family's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7656)|
| 2:07:46| Or I'm there and I think have given thousands of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7666)|
| 2:07:53| Or the lawyer that said he came to Knoxville and I stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| My cousin, Mr. Wright, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| We have to be cousins because we do share the last name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| and the same seat number from the original election for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7688)|
| 2:08:15| Or the very important people, that's the volunteers in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| It goes on for a couple of more, but then it was noted of people that get to have life experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7701)|
| 2:08:31| And the ones that were named were Boy Scouts or senior citizens or veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| Well, heck, I hit in all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| But the one that I thought of most, though, was Len Hill, principal at Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7722)|
| 2:08:49| He needs to get away from Gibbs High School at least a week or so in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| And that's the place that you can go and get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| I've heard him talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| I'm not a back country camper or packer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| But I think this is a thing that is being, I don't want to use the word attacked, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7745)|
| 2:09:14| We're asking to pay a fee now for something that I think we're already paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| So it's only taken a week for this kind of get off the fence and be for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| So if I'm going to be for something, I had to say something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| So I'll be in support of the resolution to support the rescinding of the $4 a night fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7770)|
| 2:09:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| Ms. Broils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Jamie and I are back country campers, and I've spent a lot of volunteer hours working on the Appalachian Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7785)|
| 2:09:54| And I personally, and also I've spent a lot of time sleeping and hiking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7794)|
| 2:10:04| and camping in state and national parks all across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| And most of them do have some kind of access fee or use fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| I'm happy to pay a fee to use any part of the national park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7814)|
| 2:10:24| I can afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| Not everybody can, but I'm happy to do it because I like to do what I can to support their maintenance and upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7826)|
| 2:10:39| But what has concerned me about this is I have concerns about the discrepancy between the regular campsite fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7839)|
| 2:10:52| and the back country fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| There are some questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| That's why I supported the substitute resolution is that I like to hear both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| and have all my questions answered before I'm asked to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| And normally, as I said, I wouldn't mind a back country fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| I'm happy to pay it for the privilege of using that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| But I have some real heartburn about some of the things I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| So I'm going to support this, but I'm going to be asking some more questions after this is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7880)|
| 2:11:28| There are some things that I've heard that just make me very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| Just to clear up one thing that Amy brought up a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| why there is a difference between the normal campsites and the back countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| That was pointed out by a couple of people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| It's the amenities you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| You get at least a porta potty to sit on rather than have to dig a hole out in the woods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| and wait for a bear to sniff you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| But they were pointing out that the way the fee structure is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| actually doing back country where there are no amenities ends up costing more than the front country where there are amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7925)|
| 2:12:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| Under this it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| But it's just like any place else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| You can go to Holiday Inn or the Ritz-Carlton or you can go to Motel 6 and you get what you pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7937)|
| 2:12:25| The folks that have worked on these trails and also the folks that have lived in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| I've spent a lot of time up in the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| At my age right now I don't do back country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| but I've got a card in my pocket that I paid five bucks for that says I can go anywhere I want to in any national park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7957)|
| 2:12:44| But you've got to be old enough and have lived long enough to get that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| So I'll be supporting this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| Didn't want to remind you all to direct your comments through the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| I can take these rather than the back and forth there, straight at each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7980)|
| 2:13:07| That was not directed to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| Oh, I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| I did want to speak also in favor of opposition to this fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| I put my name on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| I had heard I greatly appreciate all you folks that have come today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| And I'm an infrequent back country camper, but it is an amazing experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| And to have a fee put on it, it does strike me as something that's unnecessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8012)|
| 2:13:40| especially given your all's descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| I mean, it's not for operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| This is for another reservation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Basically an admin cost that should be avoided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| And I think that also the National Park Service is aware of efforts to oppose the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8032)|
| 2:14:01| And they have opportunity to come and come to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| And, evidently, they haven't listened very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| certainly to at least in terms of the folks who have attended our meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| So, anyway, just wanted to say thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| And I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| So we have a motion to approve before us the opposition of this back country fee imposed on the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8066)|
| 2:14:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| We have one nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8081)|

| 2:21:57| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| Hey, Doc, before you sit down, I just wanted to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| I think all three candidates are great candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| and I think I'd like for all three of them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| I wish we had room for all three of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| and I don't know if there's another appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| mayor's appointment or the board have appointments, all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| Is anybody on there now or is this a new committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| They're actually all currently serving and all will continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| You'll be just appointing one of the people who's already serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| So these people are already serving, willing to serve, and will continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Because there are six appointments, one from each legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8551)|
| 2:22:37| and take that back, yeah, six appointments, one from each legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| one from each executive office, Farragut, Knoxville, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| And so there's a total of 21 people on the community health council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| So others are elected from within the body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| Who's our current appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| You don't have one because this is a new committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| The community health council is a new body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| It has been previously functioning as the Together Healthy Knox leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8585)|

| 2:23:14| I'd just like to enter Mark Field in, I guess, as a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| Mark Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| Or do you want to place all three of them and vote until somebody gets six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8600)|
| 2:23:29| I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| It doesn't sound like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| They're all serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| So any other discussion of nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| Could we appoint Mr. Field just by acclamation if no one objects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8619)|
| 2:23:46| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| So it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8628)|

| 2:27:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| On page 10, a resolution providing proceeds of sale of the county's surplus properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8835)|
| 2:27:24| to be applied as provided under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| This is Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| So we've got this item on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| Ms. Broyles wished to take it off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| So go ahead, Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| Yeah, and the reason why, and if this was all it was, I'd be fine with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8860)|
| 2:27:45| but reading through the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| it actually repeals three earlier resolutions that have to do with the workings of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8867)|
| 2:27:54| And so I think that it would be very appropriate to let the Education Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8874)|
| 2:28:01| while we're working out these issues, to let them tackle this one as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8881)|
| 2:28:09| and then bring it back with the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| Yes, I'm making a substitute motion that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| You're making a substitute motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| Or we can just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| Send it to the Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| On the previous ones that we're sending to the Education Committee, we just deferred those, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| So we can just defer this one and send it to the Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8913)|
| 2:28:34| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| So on the floor right now is the discussion of that deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| I just want to ask the law director to clarify again when we say that it will be applied as provided under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8925)|
| 2:28:52| What exactly does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| What is the change from what we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| Currently, we have the resolutions that Commissioner Broyles has brought up to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8937)|
| 2:29:05| if the property is some of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| We have a hodgepodge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| If properties used and are titled by Knox County are used by school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8951)|
| 2:29:17| then if sold, the proceeds can go to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| This would make all properties titled to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8962)|
| 2:29:28| And if so, go to the general fund and be disposed of at the discretion of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8968)|
| 2:29:36| Those are the two distinct differences between the prior resolution that's in play and currently on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8976)|
| 2:29:44| and the reason it and this particular resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| That's kind of the bottom line effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| And it would change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| So basically just going to the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| it would be up to us to determine where it would be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| It could be spent wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| You know, I'm hearing that, you know, I think last week we ended up amending this in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9008)|
| 2:30:16| The finance director came and gave additional language that at the time, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9016)|
| 2:30:22| I wasn't aware that that would, for all practical purposes, take that out of the school board's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9022)|
| 2:30:29| So I'm in agreement with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| Let's make haste a little slower this time and take it to the school board, to the joint committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9031)|
| 2:30:38| have them hash it out and, you know, give us a recommendation or just their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9038)|
| 2:30:45| Whatever comes back comes back from that joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| I do tend to agree that this would be putting things, putting the cart before the horse at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9049)|
| 2:30:59| I'm just really interested to see what that committee comes back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| And I think this would tie our hands again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| You know, we may end up being right back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| but I'd rather not take action until this joint committee has had an opportunity to hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9069)|
