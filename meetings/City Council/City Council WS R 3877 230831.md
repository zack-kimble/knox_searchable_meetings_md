|     105 |   111 | We'll go ahead and get started with some introductory remarks by Deputy Mayor Gill.                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=105.0)  |

|     115 |   117 | You'll excuse that David is having to do the slides,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=115.0)  |
|     117 |   122 | so bear with us through a little extra technical fun this afternoon.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=117.0)  |
|     122 |   125 | But, Council, as you know, the city is committed to being a model employer,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=122.0)  |
|     125 |   131 | and that means ensuring that all of our employees have a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination.  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=125.0)  |
|     131 |   134 | We also, as you know, believe in civil service,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=131.0)  |
|     134 |   139 | and we take seriously our commitment to uphold the city charter's civil service protections                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=134.0)  |
|     139 |   143 | of equitable treatment and merit-based hiring, transfer, and promotions.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=139.0)  |
|     143 |   148 | And, of course, we also must comply with equal employment laws.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=143.0)  |
|     148 |   151 | Compliance, however, is just the first step,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=148.0)  |
|     151 |   155 | and we strive to create a workplace that celebrates diversity                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=151.0)  |
|     155 |   159 | and provides a great career experience for all of our employees.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=155.0)  |
|     159 |   164 | And we have staff across city government who work to make that happen at all levels.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=159.0)  |
|     164 |   169 | I want to acknowledge that through both civil service and human resources,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=164.0)  |
|     169 |   173 | we're making constant improvements that advance a more equitable workplace.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=169.0)  |
|     173 |   178 | Just a few examples over the last few years with leadership from both of those departments,                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=173.0)  |
|     178 |   183 | we've updated and increased supervisor and manager training on how to prevent and respond                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=178.0)  |
|     183 |   189 | to both real as well as perceived cases of discrimination and harassment in the workplace.                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=183.0)  |
|     189 |   195 | We revised the KPD supervisor promotional test to remove barriers for qualified applicants,                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=189.0)  |
|     195 |   202 | and we've streamlined KPD and KFD hiring processes to help keep more qualified applicants in the pipeline.         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=195.0)  |
|     202 |   206 | So I want to appreciate that that staff has been working together to make those changes                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=202.0)  |
|     206 |   210 | in the improvement of our career pathways.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=206.0)  |
|     210 |   214 | So we're pleased tonight to have some time to discuss the next phase of analysis                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=210.0)  |
|     214 |   218 | to help us better prevent and respond to discrimination and harassment.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=214.0)  |
|     218 |   224 | That is a conversation that began in July of 2021 with city council,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=218.0)  |
|     224 |   228 | as you discussed a resolution regarding those policies.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=224.0)  |
|     228 |   233 | That resolution, R263202, for anyone keeping score at home,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=228.0)  |
|     233 |   238 | requested that the mayor study and make a report regarding the city's existing policies                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=233.0)  |
|     238 |   241 | for racist and sexist practices within city government,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=238.0)  |
|     241 |   246 | and also outline any recommendations to strengthen those policies as permitted                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=241.0)  |
|     246 |   251 | under the city's civil service rules and other applicable laws.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=246.0)  |
|     251 |   256 | So if you recall, our initial analysis, which was shared with you back in November of 2021,                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=251.0)  |
|     256 |   259 | recommended several areas for further study and review.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=256.0)  |
|     259 |   265 | And tonight's presentation really focuses on that, in particular several topics                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=259.0)  |
|     266 |   271 | where that initial report identified that a third-party review with independent experts                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=266.0)  |
|     271 |   275 | could help inform additional improvement of our rules.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=271.0)  |
|     275 |   281 | So what you'll hear about tonight is where we've engaged those consultants,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=275.0)  |
|     281 |   287 | MTAS, as well as outside council, to review peer cities' policies and procedures,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=281.0)  |
|     287 |   291 | identify appropriate organizational placement of equal employment officer                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=287.0)  |
|     291 |   294 | and related responsibilities, and reviewing and making recommendations                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=291.0)  |
|     294 |   299 | for strengthening Chapter 15, Article 2, Division 2 of the city code,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=294.0)  |
|     299 |   302 | which is what deals with employment discrimination.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=299.0)  |
|     302 |   309 | So that review of our laws, the rules that are on the books, so to speak, is complete,                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=302.0)  |
|     309 |   314 | and Mr. Devin Lyon, a partner with Arnett, Baker, Draper, and Haygood,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=309.0)  |
|     314 |   316 | will review that analysis with you.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=314.0)  |
|     316 |   320 | And as you'll see in your slide printout, this review is quite thorough,                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=316.0)  |
|     320 |   325 | so as Mr. Lyon goes through his presentation, after he's complete,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=320.0)  |
|     325 |   330 | we'd like to offer council the opportunity to ask Mr. Lyon any questions                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=325.0)  |
|     330 |   332 | that you might have about that review.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=330.0)  |
|     332 |   336 | Following that, then, I'll turn the microphone over to Dr. Kelly Drummond,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=332.0)  |
|     336 |   340 | our director of the city's HR department, to provide a quick overview                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=336.0)  |
|     340 |   344 | of how we plan to take action and follow through on those recommendations                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=340.0)  |
|     344 |   347 | to strengthen our policies and processes.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=344.0)  |
|     347 |   351 | So I want to reiterate, as we get started again, that these actions,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=347.0)  |
|     351 |   354 | that both the review and the actions that are recommended,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=351.0)  |
|     354 |   357 | are designed to remain consistent with the very important                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=354.0)  |
|     357 |   360 | civil service charter protections that we hold for all city employees.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=357.0)  |
|     360 |   362 | That was an important starting point.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=360.0)  |
|     362 |   366 | The charter is our constitution here locally, and so it was an important lens                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=362.0)  |
|     366 |   370 | that we took into account and that our outside council reviewed in some detail                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=366.0)  |
|     370 |   374 | to make sure that we would remain in step with those important rules.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=370.0)  |
|     374 |   378 | So without much further ado, we appreciate your request for a workshop on this topic,                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=374.0)  |
|     378 |   381 | and we'll look forward to discussing the report, recommendations,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=378.0)  |
|     381 |   383 | and our next steps on this important work.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=381.0)  |
|     383 |   384 | Thank you.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=383.0)  |
|     384 |   385 | Thank you very much.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=384.0)  |
|     385 |   388 | Mr. Lyon, we'll let you go through the presentation.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=385.0)  |
|     388 |   389 | Welcome.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=388.0)  |
|     389 |   391 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=389.0)  |
|     391 |   393 | Good evening, city council members.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=391.0)  |
|     393 |   396 | It is great to be in front of and to speak with each of you again.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=393.0)  |
|     396 |   400 | To piggyback on what you just heard from Deputy Mayor Gill,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=396.0)  |
|     400 |   406 | this is the second of two parts of a report that was prompted from city council's passage                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=400.0)  |
|     406 |   411 | of resolution number R263-2021.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=406.0)  |
|     411 |   416 | As part of the mayor's report that was submitted to city council,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=411.0)  |
|     416 |   420 | you heard that there were going to be consultants that would be retained,                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=416.0)  |
|     420 |   425 | MTAS being one and outside council, or me being the other,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=420.0)  |
|     425 |   429 | to do three specific things that you're going to hear about tonight,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=425.0)  |
|     429 |   432 | and that's what's in bold at the bottom of this slide here.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=429.0)  |
|     432 |   441 | My examination of the city's EEO program was to identify the appropriate organizational placement                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=432.0)  |
|     441 |   445 | of EEO functions, to review Code Chapter 15,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=441.0)  |
|     445 |   451 | and to review the city administrative rules relative to said EEO functions.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=445.0)  |
|     451 |   455 | And for clarity, when I speak about EEO and EEO functions tonight,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=451.0)  |
|     455 |   459 | I'm referring to Equal Employment Opportunity Protections.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=455.0)  |
|     459 |   463 | Those are protections that are established by federal and state law,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=459.0)  |

|     481 |   485 | And David, again, apologies for having to make you run the slideshow here,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=481.0)  |
|     485 |   487 | but yeah, this is great, the executive summary.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=485.0)  |
|     487 |   492 | The report itself is organized into four parts,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=487.0)  |
|     492 |   496 | and I will do my best to keep it organized in those four parts tonight.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=492.0)  |
|     496 |   505 | The first is a brief analysis of what the city currently does regarding EEO functions and EEO enforcement.         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=496.0)  |
|     505 |   510 | The second is to take a historical perspective and do a little bit of legal archaeology                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=505.0)  |
|     510 |   515 | to determine why the city does what the city does.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=510.0)  |
|     515 |   523 | The third section is where MTAS played a key role to look at benchmark peer cities                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=515.0)  |
|     523 |   527 | and determine exactly what those cities do or those counties do                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=523.0)  |
|     527 |   532 | to comply with the federal and state requirements of EEO.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=527.0)  |
|     532 |   536 | This was a difficult task for MTAS, as we'll hear more about later,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=532.0)  |
|     536 |   540 | just because there are so few local governmental entities                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=536.0)  |
|     540 |   545 | that have dual HR and expansive civil service systems.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=540.0)  |
|     545 |   548 | So it was very difficult to even identify peer cities                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=545.0)  |
|     548 |   552 | who did things the way that the city of Knoxville does them.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=548.0)  |
|     552 |   558 | But nevertheless, we were able to identify multiple governmental entities in that regard.                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=552.0)  |
|     558 |   561 | And from looking at those benchmark survey results                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=558.0)  |
|     561 |   564 | and from looking at the city's history                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=561.0)  |
|     564 |   569 | and what the governing documents for the city of Knoxville actually requires in the way of EEO,                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=564.0)  |
|     569 |   575 | I was able to put together some recommendations that I will close the presentation with this afternoon.            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=569.0)  |
|     575 |   579 | So if you think of it, we're going to go through what does the city currently do,                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=575.0)  |
|     579 |   583 | why does it do it that way, what do other governments do,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=579.0)  |
|     583 |   586 | and then what's the path forward?                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=583.0)  |
|     586 |   590 | Is there a best practice we can identify and try to move toward that?                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=586.0)  |
|     590 |   593 | So what does the city currently do?                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=590.0)  |
|     593 |   601 | The city's commitment to EEO protections actually exceeds its legal obligations.                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=593.0)  |
|     601 |   605 | The legal obligations are set forth in federal and state law.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=601.0)  |
|     605 |   612 | They are also set forth through judicial opinions that have interpreted federal and state law.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=605.0)  |
|     612 |   615 | And the city actually does one better.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=612.0)  |
|     615 |   617 | I say one, actually four.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=615.0)  |
|     617 |   624 | The city has a charter that imposes additional EEO requirements for city governance.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=617.0)  |
|     624 |   628 | The same is true of the city code, the city administrative rules,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=624.0)  |
|     628 |   630 | and then even in the civil service merit board rules,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=628.0)  |
|     630 |   633 | there are additional protections afforded to employees to effectuate                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=630.0)  |
|     633 |   641 | and discharge the duties that are required by state and federal EEO law.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=633.0)  |
|     641 |   644 | Going through a few of those in the charter,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=641.0)  |
|     644 |   649 | the mayor is required to submit an annual report to city council on Title VI compliance.                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=644.0)  |
|     649 |   655 | Each agency and board of the city is also required to submit an annual report of nondiscrimination.                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=649.0)  |
|     655 |   659 | That goes to the mayor and then in turn is incorporated into the report                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=655.0)  |
|     659 |   662 | that is given to city council on an annual basis.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=659.0)  |
|     662 |   669 | We also have a charter provision that requires that all personnel actions must be nondiscriminatory in nature.     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=662.0)  |
|     669 |   673 | And then specific to the civil service merit board in Article X of the charter,                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=669.0)  |
|     673 |   675 | which we'll talk about more in depth later,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=673.0)  |
|     675 |   682 | there are two key powers of the merit board that invoke EEO functionality.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=675.0)  |
|     682 |   685 | The first is in 1003F8,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=682.0)  |
|     685 |   692 | which is the board is entitled to hear allegations of discrimination in hiring, transfer, or promotion.            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=685.0)  |
|     692 |   698 | They can also hear allegations of neglect of duty or other violations of merit system principles.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=692.0)  |
|     698 |   701 | And then in Charter Section 1003F11,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=698.0)  |
|     701 |   708 | the board is entitled to develop a program to provide for EEO.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=701.0)  |
|     708 |   710 | Moving on to city code,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=708.0)  |
|     710 |   718 | one of the key code chapters that you will hear me discuss again more in depth later is this Code Chapter 15.      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=710.0)  |
|     718 |   725 | This is the city's nondiscrimination chapter for all city employment as expressed in code.                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=718.0)  |
|     725 |   731 | It requires a nondiscrimination clause that is incorporated in all city contracts by the law department.           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=725.0)  |
|     731 |   738 | And it also sets forth a blanket provision in Code Section 15-57                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=731.0)  |
|     738 |   745 | that prohibits discrimination in employment on all of the protected classes that you see in front of you.          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=738.0)  |
|     745 |   751 | And all of those protected classes are all additionally protected by state and federal law.                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=745.0)  |
|     751 |   756 | So those are incorporated into the city code as well.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=751.0)  |
|     756 |   765 | There are two key provisions of Chapter 15 relative to the enforcement of the city's nondiscrimination provisions. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=756.0)  |
|     765 |   769 | The first is Code Section 15-53.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=765.0)  |
|     769 |   776 | This provision vests responsibility for carrying out and enforcing the provisions of Chapter 15                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=769.0)  |
|     776 |   781 | or the nondiscrimination provisions with a person designated by the mayor                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=776.0)  |
|     781 |   784 | to carry out the functions and purposes of this division.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=781.0)  |
|     784 |   790 | But that person must be an appointed member of the Civil Service Board staff.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=784.0)  |
|     790 |   794 | Currently, the only appointed member of the Civil Service Board staff                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=790.0)  |
|     794 |   797 | is the Executive Secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=794.0)  |
|     797 |   803 | So while Code Section 15-53 suggests that the mayor may designate an individual                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=797.0)  |
|     803 |   807 | as the enforcing officer to carry out these nondiscrimination provisions,                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=803.0)  |
|     807 |   811 | in practice, there is only one position that can do that by code,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=807.0)  |
|     811 |   814 | and that is the Executive Secretary of the board.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=811.0)  |
|     814 |   821 | Section 15-54 then sets forth the powers and duties of that enforcing officer.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=814.0)  |
|     821 |   825 | And these are only a few, but they are very broad, very broad powers.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=821.0)  |

|     836 |   840 | and will protect persons from discrimination in employment                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=836.0)  |
|     840 |   843 | on all grounds covered by this division.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=840.0)  |
|     843 |   847 | And there is no further clarification provided in that particular section of code,                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=843.0)  |
|     847 |   851 | which emphasizes the broad nature of those powers.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=847.0)  |

|     853 |   858 | Once again, we have another blanket nondiscrimination prohibition                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=853.0)  |

|     862 |   867 | We also have a harassment policy that the city has promulgated                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=862.0)  |
|     867 |   871 | in Section 1.06 of the Administrative Rules.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=867.0)  |

|     883 |   887 | at which point the Civil Service Director can make a determination                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=883.0)  |

|     890 |   894 | can perform that investigation if the Civil Service Director so chooses.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=890.0)  |

|     900 |   904 | And then a report will be issued of the findings of said investigation                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=900.0)  |
|     904 |   909 | to the mayor and the department head of the affected individual or individuals.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=904.0)  |
|     909 |   914 | The harassment policy also prohibits retaliation                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=909.0)  |

|     917 |   921 | or against anyone who participates in a harassment investigation.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=917.0)  |
|     921 |   924 | There are similar protections afforded to individuals                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=921.0)  |
|     924 |   927 | who have complaints of workplace violence.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=924.0)  |
|     927 |   930 | That is in Administrative Rule 1.07.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=927.0)  |
|     930 |   934 | The reason that is included in this report is that the workplace violence policy                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=930.0)  |
|     934 |   939 | that the city has promulgated cites intimidation and harassment                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=934.0)  |
|     939 |   943 | as bases for workplace violence to have occurred.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=939.0)  |
|     943 |   945 | So they're really one and the same.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=943.0)  |
|     945 |   949 | If there is a finding of harassment, that could also invoke                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=945.0)  |
|     949 |   951 | the workplace violence policy.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=949.0)  |
|     951 |   953 | And again, the procedure for reporting those complaints                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=951.0)  |
|     953 |   959 | is very similar to what I just described in Administrative Rule 1.06 with harassment.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=953.0)  |
|     959 |   964 | And finally, the Administrative Rules have in Rule 15 an ADA,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=959.0)  |

|     967 |   971 | This sets forth the city's reasonable accommodation process                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=967.0)  |
|     971 |   974 | for qualified individuals with a disability                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=971.0)  |

|     977 |   980 | There is a grievance procedure under the ADA                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=977.0)  |
|     980 |   983 | that is addressed in the ADA compliance manual.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=980.0)  |
|     983 |   989 | And the ADA compliance manual also sets forth a reasonable accommodation committee                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=983.0)  |
|     989 |   996 | to hear appeals of reasonable accommodation requests that may have been denied.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=989.0)  |
|     997 |  1001 | The organizational structure of the city also provides additional protections                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=997.0)  |
|    1001 |  1004 | for EEO functions.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1001.0) |
|    1004 |  1006 | One of these that I know you all are familiar with                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1004.0) |

|    1011 |  1015 | I've given a pretty complicated series of names for this                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1011.0) |
|    1015 |  1020 | quote-unquote department here because it's very confusingly organized.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1015.0) |
|    1020 |  1025 | This is actually an office of the mayor that by code                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1020.0) |

|    1085 |  1088 | And that's what the city has done in Code Chapter 15                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1085.0) |

|    1147 |  1151 | So that's a lot, admittedly, to take in.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1147.0) |

|    1155 |  1157 | that sounds great, that's a whole lot.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1155.0) |

|    1161 |  1166 | I will say that the city has done an excellent job, in my opinion,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1161.0) |
|    1166 |  1171 | of focusing on compliance with EEO requirements.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1166.0) |

|    1176 |  1181 | and how all of these different EEO protections and myriad policies                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1176.0) |

|    1185 |  1190 | The result is that you have EEO requirements, as you've just seen,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1185.0) |

|    1276 |  1280 | You would need to then contact, as it's stated in code,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1276.0) |

|    1288 |  1292 | So it's a tangled web of policies                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1288.0) |

|    1317 |  1321 | again, without looking at the big picture.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1317.0) |
|    1321 |  1324 | And as best I can determine from looking back through                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1321.0) |

|    1349 |  1352 | take a look at Code Section 1553.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1349.0) |
|    1352 |  1353 | I referenced it earlier.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1352.0) |
|    1353 |  1355 | This is the one that states that                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1353.0) |

|    1358 |  1360 | is the EEO enforcing officer.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1358.0) |
|    1360 |  1362 | Well, that's what the code says,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1360.0) |
|    1362 |  1366 | but that actually conflicts with Charter Section 1003                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1362.0) |
|    1366 |  1371 | that does not give the Executive Secretary any authority in that regard,                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1366.0) |
|    1371 |  1373 | but doesn't even give the Civil Service Merit Board                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1371.0) |

|    1380 |  1385 | As I mentioned earlier, Charter Section 1003, F8,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1380.0) |

|    1390 |  1394 | not the broad authority that is set forth in Code Section 1553.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1390.0) |
|    1394 |  1397 | This also conflicts internally with the code                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1394.0) |
|    1397 |  1403 | in that Code Section 2-3 vests equal employment authority with the mayor,                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1397.0) |

|    1409 |  1413 | So, again, we have internal conflicts within the code                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1409.0) |
|    1413 |  1416 | and conflicts that go all the way back to the Charter.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1413.0) |
|    1416 |  1420 | The same is true for Section 2-111, as I just mentioned.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1416.0) |

|    1430 |  1434 | And, again, that's in direct contravention of Code Section 15-53                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1430.0) |
|    1435 |  1439 | that puts those same authorities within, practically,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1435.0) |

|    1443 |  1448 | Yet another conflict is in Administrative Rule 1.06.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1443.0) |
|    1448 |  1451 | So, David, if you could go to the next slide, please. Thank you.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1448.0) |

|    1464 |  1469 | Again, that conflicts with Charter Article 10 in Section 1003                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1464.0) |
|    1469 |  1474 | that limits the Merit Board's authority to only harass employees                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1469.0) |
|    1474 |  1477 | for hiring, transfer, and promotion.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1474.0) |
|    1477 |  1480 | And, again, there's no authority for the Executive Secretary                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1477.0) |
|    1480 |  1483 | individually to be performing any of these tasks.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1480.0) |
|    1483 |  1486 | Those powers are only vested in the Board itself.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1483.0) |
|    1486 |  1492 | The same criticism can be made toward Administrative Rule 1.07,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1486.0) |

|    1494 |  1496 | So I won't belabor that point.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1494.0) |
|    1496 |  1499 | And then, finally, one final conflict of many,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1496.0) |
|    1499 |  1501 | the fifth one that I provided for you,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1499.0) |
|    1501 |  1505 | is Civil Service Merit Board Rule Article 3.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1501.0) |
|    1505 |  1508 | So, David, that's also on the next slide. Thank you.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1505.0) |
|    1508 |  1514 | Article 3 states that the city shall establish and, importantly,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1508.0) |

|    1518 |  1522 | And the Merit Board's own Article 3 states that the Board has the power                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1518.0) |
|    1522 |  1529 | only to develop a program to provide for EEO, not to enforce said program.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1522.0) |
|    1529 |  1533 | And that language was specifically chosen because it is a direct quote                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1529.0) |
|    1533 |  1535 | from Article 10 of the Charter.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1533.0) |
|    1535 |  1541 | Those are, that that is, Provision 1003F11 of the Board's power                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1535.0) |
|    1541 |  1545 | to develop a program, not to enforce.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1541.0) |
|    1545 |  1549 | Yet, in the Merit Board rules, Article 17, again,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1545.0) |
|    1549 |  1552 | gives the Executive Secretary broad authority to investigate                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1549.0) |
|    1552 |  1556 | any discrimination complaint that may be made to Civil Service.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1552.0) |
|    1556 |  1563 | So, again, we have conflicts built in at almost every layer of city authority.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1556.0) |
|    1563 |  1567 | So why do we have these?                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1563.0) |
|    1567 |  1572 | Why does the City Code organize EEO functions the way it currently does?                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1567.0) |
|    1572 |  1576 | And what does the Charter actually require regarding EEO enforcement,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1572.0) |
|    1576 |  1579 | which is perhaps the million-dollar question here?                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1576.0) |
|    1579 |  1586 | And this took me down the path of trying to trace our historical steps.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1579.0) |
|    1586 |  1588 | And I'll be frank with you.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1586.0) |
|    1588 |  1591 | This was a large undertaking, as you may have seen                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1588.0) |
|    1591 |  1595 | if you've had an opportunity to flip through this report.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1591.0) |
|    1595 |  1599 | I did not realize exactly what I was setting into                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1595.0) |
|    1599 |  1601 | when I started going down this path.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1599.0) |
|    1601 |  1608 | But it took me through analyses of the Charter all the way back to 1945,                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1601.0) |
|    1608 |  1612 | City Code all the way back to 1962, law director opinions,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1608.0) |

|    1621 |  1624 | And going through all those documents,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1621.0) |
|    1624 |  1628 | I think there is an answer for why the city has established                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1624.0) |
|    1628 |  1630 | its EEO functions in this way,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1628.0) |
|    1630 |  1634 | and there is an answer for what the Charter actually requires.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1630.0) |
|    1634 |  1638 | And that answer, as it became apparent from reviewing these documents,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1634.0) |
|    1638 |  1642 | is that EEO enforcement must be, pursuant to Charter,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1638.0) |
|    1642 |  1645 | must be performed by the city administration                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1642.0) |

|    1648 |  1651 | rather than how it is currently organized.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1648.0) |
|    1651 |  1657 | And to clarify, this historical analysis is in no way intended                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1651.0) |
|    1657 |  1661 | to bolster any division of the city over another.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1657.0) |
|    1661 |  1666 | It is simply an assessment of what the Charter and the Code require                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1661.0) |
|    1666 |  1670 | and what they were designed to accomplish when they were drafted.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1666.0) |
|    1670 |  1672 | And this is a question of critical importance                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1670.0) |
|    1672 |  1676 | because even if we can identify what other governments may do                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1672.0) |
|    1676 |  1680 | in Section 3 of this report with our benchmark survey from MTAS,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1676.0) |
|    1680 |  1683 | that is irrelevant if our Charter requires us                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1680.0) |
|    1683 |  1686 | to perform certain duties in a certain way.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1683.0) |
|    1686 |  1689 | So the question of what does the Charter require                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1686.0) |
|    1689 |  1692 | must be answered first before moving on to                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1689.0) |
|    1692 |  1694 | can we improve what we're currently doing                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1692.0) |
|    1694 |  1697 | based on what other local governments do.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1694.0) |
|    1697 |  1698 | So bear with me.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1697.0) |
|    1698 |  1702 | I'm going to, as quickly as I can, hit the highlights                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1698.0) |
|    1702 |  1707 | of what this historical analysis made apparent to me                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1702.0) |
|    1707 |  1710 | and to demonstrate, I hope, how I've concluded                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1707.0) |
|    1710 |  1712 | that the executive branch and the mayor                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1710.0) |
|    1712 |  1718 | must be the division of the city that is tasked with EEO enforcement.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1712.0) |
|    1718 |  1725 | In 1945, the Charter actually set forth a civil service board.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1718.0) |
|    1725 |  1730 | The board only handled examinations and certifications of city employment.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1725.0) |
|    1730 |  1733 | Any prejudicial acts, as they were termed at the time,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1730.0) |
|    1733 |  1738 | were only resolved by the department head of the individual and the mayor.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1733.0) |
|    1738 |  1741 | And while there was a separate board of civil service appeals                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1738.0) |
|    1741 |  1745 | that heard major penalties or significant disciplinary actions,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1741.0) |
|    1745 |  1747 | those were only disciplinary actions                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1745.0) |
|    1747 |  1750 | that had nothing to do with discrimination.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1747.0) |
|    1750 |  1754 | Again, this is 1945 prior to federal protections relating to EEO,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1750.0) |
|    1754 |  1757 | so there was no involvement by the civil service board                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1754.0) |
|    1757 |  1760 | in EEO matters at that time.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1757.0) |
|    1760 |  1763 | The same is true in 1962.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1760.0) |
|    1763 |  1767 | The board held the same powers and duties.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1763.0) |
|    1767 |  1770 | All that had changed at this point was that a secretary,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1767.0) |
|    1770 |  1772 | or executive secretary as it's now termed,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1770.0) |
|    1772 |  1775 | was created to keep a minute book of meetings.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1772.0) |
|    1775 |  1780 | And this continued for 36 years where the mayor and administration alone                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1775.0) |
|    1780 |  1785 | resolved and fielded any what would be termed today EEO complaints,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1780.0) |
|    1785 |  1788 | and that's despite the existence of the civil service board                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1785.0) |
|    1788 |  1790 | for the duration of that period.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1788.0) |
|    1790 |  1793 | Now, in 1968, we see the first ordinance                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1790.0) |
|    1793 |  1797 | that the city through city council enacted                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1793.0) |
|    1797 |  1799 | that related to non-discrimination.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1797.0) |
|    1799 |  1803 | This was a non-discrimination clause for all city contracts,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1799.0) |
|    1803 |  1807 | and again, it provided very little guidance in the way of                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1803.0) |
|    1807 |  1811 | what area of the city was to enforce this non-discrimination clause.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1807.0) |
|    1811 |  1816 | I gather that because a violation of this clause was deemed a misdemeanor,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1811.0) |
|    1816 |  1819 | it could only be enforced by KPD and the law department,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1816.0) |
|    1819 |  1822 | but the code was silent relative to that.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1819.0) |
|    1822 |  1828 | In 1973, city council passed ordinance number 5559,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1822.0) |
|    1828 |  1832 | and this was in response to the Civil Rights Act of 1964                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1828.0) |
|    1832 |  1835 | and the EEO Act of 1972.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1832.0) |
|    1835 |  1839 | City council passed this ordinance expressly                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1835.0) |
|    1839 |  1842 | to implement an affirmative action program                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1839.0) |
|    1842 |  1847 | to sort out how complaints alleging discrimination would be processed,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1842.0) |
|    1847 |  1850 | and this was actually the very first iteration                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1847.0) |
|    1850 |  1853 | of what today you see in code chapter 15.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1850.0) |
|    1853 |  1856 | It's actually very similar to what we have,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1853.0) |

|    1860 |  1864 | section 10 of this ordinance stated that                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1860.0) |

|    1868 |  1870 | with the equal employment opportunity officer                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1868.0) |
|    1870 |  1873 | who shall be an appointed member of the mayor's staff.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1870.0) |

|    1877 |  1880 | That is roughly the same language we have                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1877.0) |

|    1894 |  1897 | So the titles have changed, but the language have not,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1894.0) |
|    1898 |  1902 | and this demonstrates that chapter 15 was originally intended                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1898.0) |
|    1902 |  1905 | for mayoral or administration enforcement,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1902.0) |
|    1905 |  1908 | and second, it bolsters the point that I made earlier                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1905.0) |
|    1908 |  1911 | about the lack of a cohesive policy for EEO.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1908.0) |
|    1911 |  1915 | By simply changing the name of the individuals                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1911.0) |
|    1915 |  1919 | who were appointed members of a particular body                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1915.0) |
|    1919 |  1923 | or who maintain close and direct liaison with the merit board,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1919.0) |
|    1923 |  1926 | that demonstrates the lack of cohesiveness                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1923.0) |
|    1926 |  1928 | and actually builds in some ambiguity                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1926.0) |
|    1928 |  1931 | when you have currently the only appointed member                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1928.0) |
|    1931 |  1934 | of the civil service board who is by code required                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1931.0) |
|    1934 |  1938 | to maintain direct and close liaison with the merit board.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1934.0) |
|    1938 |  1941 | Obviously, that's the case.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1938.0) |
|    1941 |  1947 | In 1973, the same ordinance, actually,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1941.0) |
|    1947 |  1952 | it also clarified the powers of the EEO officer,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1947.0) |
|    1952 |  1955 | and the important takeaway here is that these provisions                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1952.0) |
|    1955 |  1960 | are nearly verbatim to what we see in code section 15-54.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1955.0) |
|    1960 |  1963 | So the powers and duties of the individual                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1960.0) |
|    1963 |  1967 | has not changed over this period of time, in 50 years.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1963.0) |
|    1967 |  1971 | And then to emphasize the organizational nature                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1967.0) |
|    1971 |  1973 | of this position at that time, as you can see I've highlighted,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1971.0) |
|    1973 |  1978 | the EEO officer operated independent from civil service,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1973.0) |
|    1978 |  1983 | which fell under the personnel office as of 1976.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1978.0) |
|    1984 |  1989 | The next matter of significance, also in 1976,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1984.0) |
|    1989 |  1992 | was an ordinance that approved recommendations                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1989.0) |
|    1992 |  1994 | from a charter revision commission.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1992.0) |
|    1994 |  1998 | This revision commission proposed, among other matters,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=1994.0) |

|    2002 |  2005 | and this was the, just as we saw the first iteration                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2002.0) |
|    2005 |  2008 | of code chapter 15 previously,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2005.0) |
|    2008 |  2011 | this review commission recommendation                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2008.0) |
|    2011 |  2015 | was actually the first iteration of what is now charter article 10.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2011.0) |
|    2015 |  2018 | It proposed the powers and duties of the merit board,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2015.0) |
|    2018 |  2021 | but with one key difference,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2018.0) |
|    2021 |  2024 | and that is that there was no mention of EEO                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2021.0) |
|    2024 |  2026 | or any development of an EEO program                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2024.0) |
|    2026 |  2030 | in the original draft of what would ultimately become                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2026.0) |

|    2032 |  2036 | And the charter revision commission even clarified itself                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2032.0) |

|    2055 |  2059 | And then secondly, as the charter review commission noted,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2055.0) |

|    2074 |  2077 | So by the charter revision commission's own admission                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2074.0) |

|    2154 |  2159 | And then in 1980, the city is undergoing some significant changes.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2154.0) |

|    2170 |  2172 | that were unpopular.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2170.0) |

|    2177 |  2182 | and the City Employees League, predominantly, was quite unhappy.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2177.0) |
|    2182 |  2187 | They perceived the mayor to be proposing parking expenses,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2182.0) |

|    2190 |  2193 | They believed they were underpaid generally.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2190.0) |
|    2193 |  2198 | So a whole list of grievances that a subset of city employees had,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2193.0) |
|    2198 |  2202 | and this came to a head in 1980.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2198.0) |

|    2215 |  2217 | So if this is difficult to read,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2215.0) |

|    2225 |  2228 | This will not be tolerated.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2225.0) |
|    2228 |  2233 | So again, the CEL is trying to organize against the initiatives                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2228.0) |

|    2244 |  2248 | to reorganize and clarify the departmental structure                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2244.0) |

|    2250 |  2253 | This was viewed by the City Employees League with suspicion,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2250.0) |
|    2253 |  2258 | and they actively discussed even lawyering up to sue the city.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2253.0) |
|    2258 |  2260 | This dispute continued,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2258.0) |
|    2260 |  2263 | and ultimately the CEL began lobbying                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2260.0) |

|    2266 |  2271 | and the CEL ended up recycling that 1976 ordinance                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2266.0) |

|    2276 |  2279 | and they began pushing for that language                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2276.0) |

|    2285 |  2288 | the CEL has been discussing in their minutes,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2285.0) |

|    2291 |  2293 | Everyone said they thought we should support                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2291.0) |

|    2295 |  2298 | It should be separate, not under the mayor and Ricker.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2295.0) |
|    2298 |  2300 | Those positions refer to Colonel Phelps,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2298.0) |

|    2303 |  2307 | the mayor, and then William Ricker, who was the COO of the city.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2303.0) |
|    2307 |  2312 | As I mentioned, they're building on the original language                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2307.0) |
|    2312 |  2315 | proposed in 1976 for a charter revision,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2312.0) |
|    2315 |  2320 | but there were two additions that they really pushed for at this time,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2315.0) |
|    2320 |  2325 | and these were the EEO provisions that we now see in 1003 F8 and F11,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2320.0) |
|    2325 |  2327 | as you can see that I've highlighted here below.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2325.0) |
|    2327 |  2329 | As they had phrased them at the time,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2327.0) |
|    2329 |  2333 | they requested that the Merit Board be given additional powers and duties                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2329.0) |
|    2333 |  2336 | to hear actions regarding discrimination broadly                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2333.0) |
|    2336 |  2339 | and to provide for, not develop a plan,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2336.0) |
|    2339 |  2344 | but provide for equal employment opportunity of all applicants and employees.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2339.0) |
|    2344 |  2347 | Nevertheless, city council did not go along.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2344.0) |
|    2347 |  2351 | They approved Mayor Tyree's administrative code,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2347.0) |
|    2351 |  2355 | and part of that created an EEO division                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2351.0) |
|    2355 |  2358 | that reported directly to the director of personnel.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2355.0) |
|    2358 |  2362 | At that time, the personnel department in today's parlance                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2358.0) |
|    2362 |  2364 | would have been the HR department.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2362.0) |
|    2364 |  2366 | This was the original iteration of that.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2364.0) |
|    2366 |  2371 | So, again, via city council action and ordinance 08580,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2366.0) |
|    2371 |  2374 | equal employment opportunity was enforced through an EEO officer                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2371.0) |
|    2374 |  2378 | that was in the equivalent of HR.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2374.0) |
|    2378 |  2384 | This, the next ordinance that city council passed that related to this                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2378.0) |
|    2384 |  2388 | was, again, just to restructure the EEO officer position                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2384.0) |
|    2388 |  2390 | to be the head of a division of personnel,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2388.0) |
|    2390 |  2393 | and as you can see, as I've highlighted in this org chart from 1980,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2390.0) |
|    2393 |  2397 | you have civil service office on one side with the civil service board                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2393.0) |
|    2397 |  2399 | and then personnel and EEO                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2397.0) |
|    2399 |  2402 | in a completely separate section of the organizational chart.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2399.0) |
|    2402 |  2406 | So here's the point of this getting up to 1980.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2402.0) |
|    2406 |  2411 | Until this time, the mayor, the EEO officer,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2406.0) |
|    2411 |  2413 | and the personnel department, or HR,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2411.0) |
|    2413 |  2416 | solely enforced EEO protections                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2413.0) |
|    2416 |  2419 | and resolved complaints of discrimination.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2416.0) |
|    2419 |  2423 | But there was a push from this segment of employees in the CEL                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2419.0) |
|    2423 |  2425 | to expand and strengthen the merit board,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2423.0) |
|    2425 |  2429 | and although that proposal included additional powers                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2425.0) |
|    2429 |  2432 | relating to EEO functions,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2429.0) |
|    2432 |  2436 | that was not the basis for their grievance at that time.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2432.0) |
|    2436 |  2440 | Their grievances were related to wages, benefits, and feared layoffs,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2436.0) |
|    2440 |  2444 | not any argument that there were problems                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2440.0) |
|    2444 |  2448 | with the EEO enforcement system as of 1980.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2444.0) |
|    2449 |  2452 | From 1980,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2449.0) |
|    2452 |  2458 | council approved a new Charter Revision Commission ordinance.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2452.0) |
|    2458 |  2465 | This is what we currently have as Article 10 of the charter.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2458.0) |
|    2465 |  2468 | It was largely what was proposed in 1976,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2465.0) |
|    2468 |  2472 | but that language I just cited that the CEL had been proposing                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2468.0) |
|    2472 |  2474 | was softened a bit.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2472.0) |
|    2474 |  2477 | As I said earlier this evening,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2474.0) |

|    2625 |  2629 | that language is now changed in Ordinance 01281                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2625.0) |

|    2690 |  2692 | surprisingly the Merit Board punted altogether                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2690.0) |

|    2717 |  2721 | and the board began disputing with the mayor                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2717.0) |

|    2724 |  2726 | and ultimately Law Director Roach                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2724.0) |
|    2726 |  2729 | agreed that he fell under the mayor's control.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2726.0) |

|    2982 |  2984 | that the Merit Board had hired,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2982.0) |
|    2984 |  2986 | and then Mayor Testerman proposed                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2984.0) |
|    2986 |  2988 | and actually ended up putting Bob Booker,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2986.0) |
|    2988 |  2990 | who was an administrative assistant                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2988.0) |
|    2990 |  2993 | in the personnel department, or again, HR,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2990.0) |
|    2993 |  2996 | as the new EEO officer for the city of Knoxville.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2993.0) |
|    2996 |  3000 | The Merit Board initially cooperated with this proposal                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=2996.0) |
|    3000 |  3003 | but then did an about-face in June of 1984,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3000.0) |
|    3003 |  3005 | called a special called meeting,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3003.0) |
|    3005 |  3009 | and then considered taking legal action against the city                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3005.0) |
|    3009 |  3011 | but ultimately relented                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3009.0) |
|    3011 |  3017 | and agreed to the abolishment of the EEO administrator position.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3011.0) |
|    3017 |  3020 | And the last step in the saga here                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3017.0) |
|    3020 |  3024 | is really Ordinance No. 15084                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3020.0) |
|    3024 |  3029 | that, again, clarified that as a duty of the mayor,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3024.0) |
|    3029 |  3032 | as an employee of the mayor,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3029.0) |
|    3032 |  3037 | the EEO officer will end up enforcing EEO functions                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3032.0) |
|    3037 |  3040 | but will do so in conjunction with the board                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3037.0) |
|    3040 |  3043 | relative to issuing a policy.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3040.0) |
|    3043 |  3046 | So this emphasizes the developmental nature                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3043.0) |
|    3046 |  3049 | of the board's role when it comes to EEO                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3046.0) |
|    3049 |  3051 | but the enforcement nature                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3049.0) |
|    3051 |  3054 | of the mayor and the administration's role relative to EEO.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3051.0) |
|    3054 |  3058 | And at that point, the trail grows cold.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3054.0) |
|    3058 |  3061 | The Civil Service Merit Board ended up moving on                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3058.0) |
|    3061 |  3064 | and there were not any further disputes of the magnitude                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3061.0) |
|    3064 |  3067 | at least as seen here in the early 80s                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3064.0) |
|    3067 |  3070 | as the charter was revised.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3067.0) |
|    3070 |  3073 | So again, that's a lot.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3070.0) |
|    3073 |  3075 | To summarize the key observations                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3073.0) |
|    3075 |  3078 | from all of that historical saga,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3075.0) |
|    3078 |  3083 | before 81, EEO functions were uniformly performed                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3078.0) |
|    3083 |  3086 | by the city administration without any Merit Board involvement.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3083.0) |
|    3086 |  3090 | In 81, with the addition of Charter Article 10,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3086.0) |
|    3090 |  3094 | that came about due to disgruntled employees                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3090.0) |
|    3094 |  3096 | but without any clear reference                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3094.0) |
|    3096 |  3101 | to any problem or concern with EEO enforcement at the time.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3096.0) |
|    3101 |  3104 | That immediately prompted confusion                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3101.0) |
|    3104 |  3107 | and there were repeated disputes                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3104.0) |
|    3107 |  3109 | between the Merit Board and the city administration                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3107.0) |
|    3109 |  3112 | about who would enforce EEO functions.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3109.0) |
|    3112 |  3114 | But when those disputes arose,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3112.0) |
|    3114 |  3117 | the legal opinions that were uniformly provided,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3114.0) |
|    3117 |  3119 | including from the drafters of Article 10,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3117.0) |
|    3119 |  3121 | consistently advised that the Merit Board                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3119.0) |
|    3121 |  3124 | could not enforce EEO protections.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3121.0) |
|    3124 |  3128 | And unfortunately, these opinions were not often understood                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3124.0) |
|    3128 |  3130 | or were sometimes disregarded.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3128.0) |
|    3130 |  3132 | And again, this is not a criticism                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3130.0) |

|    3135 |  3138 | This is, I think, to the extent it is a criticism,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3135.0) |

|    3146 |  3150 | to clarify exactly who or what subset of the city                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3146.0) |
|    3150 |  3152 | was responsible for EEO enforcement,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3150.0) |
|    3152 |  3157 | and for probably myriad reasons, never did so.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3152.0) |
|    3157 |  3161 | And so this dispute was able to linger for multiple years.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3157.0) |
|    3161 |  3163 | So what that tells us,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3161.0) |
|    3163 |  3166 | in moving on to this third section of the report,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3163.0) |
|    3166 |  3170 | is that there is an answer from the Charter,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3166.0) |
|    3170 |  3174 | by the drafters of the Charter, of who is to enforce EEO.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3170.0) |
|    3174 |  3176 | And pursuant to our Charter,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3174.0) |
|    3176 |  3180 | that is the city administration and the mayor.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3176.0) |
|    3180 |  3182 | Despite current code provisions                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3180.0) |
|    3182 |  3183 | referencing the Merit Board                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3182.0) |
|    3183 |  3185 | or an executive secretary of the Merit Board,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3183.0) |
|    3185 |  3187 | that is not what the Charter intended                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3185.0) |
|    3187 |  3189 | and that is not what the Charter says.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3187.0) |
|    3189 |  3193 | So with the answer to that question now determined,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3189.0) |
|    3193 |  3197 | we can move on to what do other local governments do                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3193.0) |
|    3197 |  3200 | and is there anything that we can glean from those practices                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3197.0) |
|    3200 |  3203 | that may be beneficial to the city of Knoxville.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3200.0) |
|    3203 |  3205 | So I worked with NTAS                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3203.0) |

|    3217 |  3220 | And by similarly situated, I mean governments                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3217.0) |
|    3220 |  3223 | that have dual HR departments and civil service systems,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3220.0) |
|    3223 |  3225 | particularly broad civil service systems                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3223.0) |

|    3230 |  3232 | And as I mentioned to kick us off this afternoon,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3230.0) |
|    3232 |  3234 | there were actually so few governments                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3232.0) |
|    3234 |  3237 | that employed a system similar to what the city does                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3234.0) |
|    3237 |  3241 | that NTAS really struggled to complete the survey.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3237.0) |
|    3241 |  3243 | But they did and they did an admiral job.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3241.0) |
|    3243 |  3248 | And there were actually even fewer governmental entities                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3243.0) |

|    3298 |  3300 | You'll be happy to hear I will not thoroughly discuss                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3298.0) |
|    3300 |  3303 | every one of these governmental entities tonight.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3300.0) |
|    3303 |  3306 | But they are summarized in section three                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3303.0) |
|    3306 |  3308 | of the body of the written report.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3306.0) |
|    3308 |  3311 | And the takeaways here are that EEO functions                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3308.0) |
|    3311 |  3314 | are almost uniformly performed and enforced                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3311.0) |
|    3314 |  3318 | by HR departments within these governmental entities                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3314.0) |
|    3318 |  3321 | with the advice of legal counsel.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3318.0) |
|    3321 |  3325 | These HR departments typically have individual staff members                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3321.0) |
|    3325 |  3329 | who are designated to review specific types of complaints,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3325.0) |
|    3329 |  3331 | depending on whether those are discrimination complaints,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3329.0) |
|    3331 |  3333 | harassment complaints, reasonable accommodation requests,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3331.0) |
|    3333 |  3335 | what have you.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3333.0) |
|    3335 |  3337 | And some HR departments,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3335.0) |
|    3337 |  3339 | particularly of larger governmental entities,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3337.0) |
|    3339 |  3341 | even have specific positions                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3339.0) |
|    3341 |  3346 | that are designated to oversee all EEO compliance                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3341.0) |
|    3346 |  3350 | from a big-picture standpoint within that governmental entity.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3346.0) |
|    3350 |  3352 | Importantly, of the governments surveyed,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3350.0) |
|    3352 |  3355 | none of them utilized a zero-tolerance policy                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3352.0) |
|    3355 |  3358 | for discrimination or harassment.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3355.0) |
|    3358 |  3361 | My speculation is, as I've included in this report,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3358.0) |
|    3361 |  3363 | based on EEOC guidance,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3361.0) |
|    3363 |  3366 | zero-tolerance policies are ill-advised                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3363.0) |
|    3366 |  3368 | pursuant to the federal EEOC.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3366.0) |
|    3368 |  3370 | So my suspicion is that's why these governments                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3368.0) |
|    3370 |  3373 | do not utilize zero-tolerance policies.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3370.0) |
|    3373 |  3377 | But this is a term that I used in this last point here,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3373.0) |
|    3377 |  3378 | in point number five.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3377.0) |
|    3378 |  3382 | Some HR departments operate as what I call clearinghouses,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3378.0) |
|    3382 |  3386 | where every complaint, every allegation of any sort                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3382.0) |
|    3386 |  3391 | that falls under a category of EEO protection                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3386.0) |
|    3391 |  3393 | goes to the HR department,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3391.0) |
|    3393 |  3396 | and the HR department serves as a clearinghouse                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3393.0) |
|    3396 |  3400 | of those complaints to handle and resolve them,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3396.0) |
|    3400 |  3403 | if that's what the HR department has the authority to do,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3400.0) |
|    3403 |  3407 | or to kick that to a different area of the city or the county                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3403.0) |
|    3407 |  3411 | if the HR department does not have the authority to do that.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3407.0) |
|    3411 |  3414 | So, again, I term that a clearinghouse.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3411.0) |
|    3414 |  3418 | And based on all of this data,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3414.0) |

|    3421 |  3424 | and historically what the city is authorized to do                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3421.0) |
|    3424 |  3426 | by its governing documents,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3424.0) |
|    3426 |  3428 | I have a few recommendations.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3426.0) |
|    3428 |  3431 | And, again, I will go through these quickly,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3428.0) |
|    3431 |  3434 | but they are set forth in considerably more detail                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3431.0) |

|    3436 |  3439 | The concerns that the city currently has                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3436.0) |
|    3439 |  3442 | is that the EEO program is scattered and self-contradictory,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3439.0) |
|    3442 |  3444 | as we've discussed.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3442.0) |

|    3463 |  3465 | that is...                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3463.0) |
|    3467 |  3468 | What happens in practice is,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3467.0) |
|    3468 |  3471 | depending on the nature of the complaint or allegation,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3468.0) |
|    3471 |  3475 | it goes to potentially a very different area of the city.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3471.0) |
|    3477 |  3479 | And we've already talked about the scattered nature                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3477.0) |
|    3479 |  3482 | of where these various positions are located,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3479.0) |
|    3482 |  3485 | so I think we can move on to the next slide.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3482.0) |
|    3487 |  3490 | To ease the burden on employees                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3487.0) |
|    3490 |  3495 | and to ensure that we are maximizing our efficiency                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3490.0) |
|    3495 |  3499 | in human resources, as is required by charter,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3495.0) |
|    3499 |  3503 | I recommend that we consolidate, the city consolidate,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3499.0) |

|    3507 |  3510 | This scattered nature of responsibility, I think,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3507.0) |
|    3510 |  3515 | likely arose because of the historical lack of an HR department                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3510.0) |
|    3515 |  3518 | after the personnel department was abolished.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3515.0) |
|    3518 |  3521 | Because of that, there was no better place,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3518.0) |
|    3521 |  3523 | from a pragmatic standpoint,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3521.0) |
|    3523 |  3528 | for city administrations to put EEO compliance and enforcement                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3523.0) |
|    3528 |  3530 | than the civil service department.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3528.0) |
|    3530 |  3535 | So while there was not a charter authority for those functions,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3530.0) |
|    3535 |  3539 | it was a convenient fit for the civil service department                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3535.0) |
|    3539 |  3542 | to perform those functions at that time.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3539.0) |

|    3547 |  3552 | as is demonstrated and corroborated by the benchmark survey results.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3547.0) |

|    3557 |  3561 | produces numerous benefits for the city.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3557.0) |
|    3561 |  3563 | The first is organizational efficiency.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3561.0) |

|    3565 |  3571 | HR can, as I discussed, can examine any complaint that comes in,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3565.0) |

|    3589 |  3592 | in that every department of the city would know where to go                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3589.0) |

|    3659 |  3662 | the accuracy of those investigations,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3659.0) |
|    3662 |  3666 | and it would foster accountability in that instead of, again,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3662.0) |

|    3669 |  3673 | with certain duties to protect EEO functions, it's in one place.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3669.0) |
|    3673 |  3677 | So if someone drops the ball, we know where it occurred.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3673.0) |
|    3677 |  3680 | It would be the HR department if there's ever a problem.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3677.0) |
|    3681 |  3683 | So how do we get there?                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3681.0) |
|    3683 |  3688 | What can the city do to actually effectuate this consolidated EEO approach?                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3683.0) |
|    3688 |  3693 | The first step is to revise the code.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3688.0) |
|    3693 |  3696 | With the reestablishment of the HR department,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3693.0) |
|    3696 |  3702 | the need for Section 1553's placement of the enforcing officer position                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3696.0) |
|    3702 |  3706 | with the executive secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board is moot.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3702.0) |
|    3706 |  3709 | That is an inoperative provision anyway,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3706.0) |
|    3709 |  3713 | but it is now completely moot from a legal standpoint.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3709.0) |
|    3713 |  3719 | Because of the additional functions that will be required by the HR department                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3713.0) |
|    3719 |  3721 | to meet all of these EEO needs,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3719.0) |
|    3721 |  3725 | it would be advisable in my estimation to consider allocating additional resources                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3721.0) |
|    3725 |  3728 | to the HR department to ensure that they have the resources they need                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3725.0) |
|    3728 |  3732 | to be able to perform all of these different functions.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3728.0) |
|    3732 |  3736 | Ideally, that could be in a deputy director position                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3732.0) |

|    3746 |  3748 | for the city of Knoxville.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3746.0) |
|    3748 |  3752 | This would then meet the extensive enforcement requirements                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3748.0) |
|    3752 |  3755 | that could remain in Code Section 15-54.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3752.0) |
|    3755 |  3760 | And this position would then supervise all EEO-focused positions                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3755.0) |

|    3770 |  3775 | Code Section 15-56 we have not talked a whole lot about tonight,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3770.0) |
|    3775 |  3780 | but that is a duplicative investigatory section of city code.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3775.0) |
|    3780 |  3784 | It's outdated, and it's actually legally unenforceable                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3780.0) |
|    3784 |  3786 | in my estimation as it currently reads.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3784.0) |

|    3804 |  3809 | to be immediately dismissed, which raises concerns about due process                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3804.0) |

|    3813 |  3820 | So because we have similar and more detailed investigatory procedures                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3813.0) |

|    3976 |  3980 | and also ultimately included with city administrative rules                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3976.0) |

|    3999 |  4003 | are that the ADA coordinator and any ADA coordinator staff                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=3999.0) |
|    4003 |  4007 | should gradually be reorganized within the Department of HR.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4003.0) |
|    4007 |  4010 | This one would require a little more effort,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4007.0) |
|    4010 |  4013 | and for that reason I've stated that it should be a gradual move                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4010.0) |
|    4013 |  4016 | because the ADA is such an expansive law.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4013.0) |
|    4016 |  4020 | The ADA has categorical functions that extend                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4016.0) |
|    4020 |  4023 | into many different departments throughout the city,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4020.0) |
|    4023 |  4026 | so that would take a little more time to ensure that the HR Department,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4023.0) |
|    4026 |  4029 | with everything else that would be moving its direction,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4026.0) |

|    4032 |  4034 | that move.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4032.0) |
|    4034 |  4038 | But fortunately, my recommendation is that the ADA coordinator                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4034.0) |
|    4038 |  4042 | ultimately become an actual coordinator position                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4038.0) |
|    4042 |  4046 | instead of what it currently is, which is the first line of defense                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4042.0) |
|    4046 |  4051 | for any complaint that comes in from the city workforce.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4046.0) |

|    4064 |  4066 | from an ADA standpoint,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4064.0) |
|    4066 |  4069 | the ADA coordinator could serve in a coordinator capacity                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4066.0) |

|    4135 |  4137 | because some policies, like, for example,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4135.0) |

|    4146 |  4150 | utilizing Code Section 15-57 as the one place                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4146.0) |

|    4152 |  4156 | would solve that problem.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4152.0) |

|    4159 |  4161 | in light of these code changes,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4159.0) |

|    4195 |  4198 | again, for the benefit of employees                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4195.0) |

|    4217 |  4219 | and quickly resolved.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4217.0) |

|    4252 |  4255 | and my recommendation is to alter the constitution                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4252.0) |

|    4261 |  4264 | where, ostensibly, an employee could file an accommodation request                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4261.0) |
|    4264 |  4268 | and then have two different bodies serve as judge and juror                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4264.0) |

|    4637 |  4641 | This is an issue that I'm extremely committed to                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4637.0) |

|    4662 |  4665 | So I wanted to start off with just saying I'm disappointed                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4662.0) |

|    4673 |  4675 | it seems like more of the same,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4673.0) |

|    4694 |  4696 | I'm disappointed in the recommendations                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4694.0) |

|    4721 |  4724 | and one question that I have, I have lots of questions,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4721.0) |
|    4724 |  4730 | but there was no discussion of what investigations have taken place                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4724.0) |

|    4845 |  4848 | Because I feel like when we're talking about ADA responsibilities,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4845.0) |
|    4848 |  4850 | when we're talking about Title VI responsibilities,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4848.0) |
|    4850 |  4852 | you are absolutely correct                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4850.0) |
|    4852 |  4861 | that that is a broad array of responsibilities,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4852.0) |
|    4861 |  4864 | that that has to encompass.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4861.0) |
|    4864 |  4868 | And I want to see us expand what we do                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4864.0) |
|    4868 |  4870 | in terms of ADA compliance                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4868.0) |
|    4870 |  4873 | so that we do actually have a real ADA coordinator,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4870.0) |
|    4873 |  4875 | not someone who's actually implementing the program,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4873.0) |
|    4875 |  4877 | but who is the coordinator.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4875.0) |
|    4877 |  4880 | And we need the same for Title VI.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4877.0) |
|    4880 |  4884 | But I don't see that in the recommendations clearly stated.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4880.0) |
|    4884 |  4890 | Also, you talked about codifying into the administrative rules.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4884.0) |
|    4890 |  4894 | I would say we would need to codify it into an ordinance                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4890.0) |
|    4894 |  4897 | so that we don't continue to have confusion                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4894.0) |
|    4897 |  4900 | as new mayors come in and decide                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4897.0) |
|    4900 |  4902 | administrative rules need to be changed.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4900.0) |
|    4902 |  4905 | So if we're going to codify it, it should be in an ordinance                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4902.0) |
|    4905 |  4910 | so we have some clarity as a city.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4905.0) |
|    4910 |  4912 | I'm not sure what else to share tonight                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4910.0) |
|    4912 |  4914 | because I have a lot of reading still to do,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4912.0) |
|    4915 |  4921 | but these are important responsibilities of a city.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4915.0) |
|    4921 |  4926 | And I don't have any evidence that over the last 50 years                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4921.0) |

|    4933 |  4936 | I've seen a lot of discussion, a lot of debate,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4933.0) |
|    4936 |  4940 | but I'm not seeing a program that's been carried out.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4936.0) |
|    4940 |  4946 | Have you seen any evidence of a program that's been carried out?                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4940.0) |
|    4946 |  4948 | Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4946.0) |
|    4948 |  4952 | To respond to your last issue first, absolutely.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4948.0) |
|    4952 |  4956 | I think that's the entirety of Section 2 of this report                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=4952.0) |

|    5043 |  5047 | I do think there is a clear delineation of function                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5043.0) |

|    5079 |  5082 | would be the individuals, as you mentioned,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5079.0) |

|    5094 |  5096 | and I think that's why you see                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5094.0) |

|    5104 |  5106 | Well, and the last thing I'll say is,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5104.0) |
|    5106 |  5108 | because that point bothered me as well,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5106.0) |

|    5112 |  5117 | and then when they expand the protections to their employees,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5112.0) |

|    5119 |  5122 | What I'm seeing is continued reduction.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5119.0) |

|    5130 |  5132 | We're wanting to move all these responsibilities                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5130.0) |

|    5137 |  5140 | It sounds like the same history that was presented to us                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5137.0) |

|    5142 |  5145 | well, do we have to have this type of program?                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5142.0) |

|    5147 |  5149 | let's just make one of the board members do it.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5147.0) |
|    5149 |  5151 | That's the same conversation that we're having.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5149.0) |
|    5151 |  5153 | Who can we dump this onto                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5151.0) |
|    5153 |  5156 | rather than who are we going to put into this position                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5153.0) |

|    5174 |  5178 | Yeah, I'll only say we do still have one presenter                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5174.0) |

|    5179 |  5181 | and that's Dr. Drummond in the HR department,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5179.0) |
|    5181 |  5183 | so I would like to make sure                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5181.0) |

|    5321 |  5322 | As we look at this,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5321.0) |
|    5322 |  5324 | I want to make sure that you understand the goals,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5322.0) |
|    5324 |  5328 | and I want to specifically address at one point                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5324.0) |
|    5328 |  5331 | the time frame in looking at this.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5328.0) |
|    5331 |  5334 | We believe that this is a pathway                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5331.0) |
|    5334 |  5341 | that will allow for everyone to have consistent information.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5334.0) |
|    5341 |  5343 | With the process that's going right now,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5341.0) |
|    5343 |  5346 | it is something that we need to look at.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5343.0) |
|    5346 |  5350 | As Devin talked about and Mr. Lyon talked about,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5346.0) |
|    5350 |  5353 | some of this legacy language, who's in charge?                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5350.0) |
|    5353 |  5357 | I agree with what Councilwoman Parker said.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5353.0) |
|    5357 |  5360 | Understanding these languages and how do we strengthen the rules,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5357.0) |
|    5360 |  5363 | and I believe that having not only ordinance                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5360.0) |
|    5363 |  5366 | but also having administrative rules,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5363.0) |
|    5366 |  5368 | also working through Civil Service                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5366.0) |
|    5368 |  5370 | to have those Civil Service administrative,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5368.0) |
|    5370 |  5373 | their Civil Service Merit Board rules done as well                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5370.0) |
|    5373 |  5374 | will help with that.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5373.0) |
|    5374 |  5380 | I think as we establish a clear line and lane of responsibility,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5374.0) |
|    5380 |  5382 | I think you'll find it very important.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5380.0) |
|    5382 |  5384 | So as we look at the next steps,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5382.0) |
|    5384 |  5387 | I believe that City Council does need time to look at this.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5384.0) |
|    5387 |  5392 | This information was brought to you all today as part of a workshop.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5387.0) |
|    5392 |  5395 | I got this information the same time that you all did.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5392.0) |
|    5395 |  5398 | So I'm looking at this and I'm saying,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5395.0) |
|    5398 |  5400 | Whoa, wow, we can do this.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5398.0) |
|    5400 |  5401 | How do we do it?                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5400.0) |
|    5401 |  5402 | But I agree.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5401.0) |
|    5402 |  5405 | I believe that we need to take time.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5402.0) |
|    5405 |  5408 | That's why as we look at this, how do we do this?                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5405.0) |
|    5408 |  5410 | How do we upstate our administrative rules?                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5408.0) |
|    5410 |  5413 | How do we work with Civil Service Merit Board                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5410.0) |
|    5413 |  5415 | to ensure that we're getting all of those things                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5413.0) |
|    5415 |  5417 | and that we're all working together?                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5415.0) |

|    5420 |  5424 | our HR staff, and all of the city employees?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5420.0) |
|    5424 |  5427 | Here's the timeline that I would like to bring forth.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5424.0) |
|    5427 |  5432 | On September 13th is the next Civil Service Merit Board meeting.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5427.0) |
|    5432 |  5437 | I have a standing time at the Civil Service Merit Board meeting,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5432.0) |
|    5437 |  5441 | and we will use that time to ensure that we communicate                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5437.0) |
|    5441 |  5444 | and educate all of the Civil Service Merit Board.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5441.0) |
|    5444 |  5446 | They have access to this information now,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5444.0) |
|    5446 |  5450 | so they have about 13 days to look at this as well.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5446.0) |

|    5455 |  5458 | So as we look at this, it is not something that you had to do                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5455.0) |

|    5546 |  5549 | lots of training that's just been set up for ADA.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5546.0) |
|    5549 |  5552 | But under HR, we have been able to do that.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5549.0) |

|    5564 |  5568 | and as we go into November, we will continue to work with the ADA coordinator                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5564.0) |
|    5568 |  5571 | and staff on all of these things.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5568.0) |

|    5580 |  5585 | to understand what is being done, and how do we work together.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5580.0) |
|    5585 |  5590 | I agree this has been a process since 1945.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5585.0) |

|    5592 |  5598 | And I started looking at this, and I want to assure you as we look at this,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5592.0) |
|    5598 |  5601 | HR has the capacity with the staffing.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5598.0) |
|    5601 |  5605 | It may mean some additional resources that was indicated here,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5601.0) |
|    5605 |  5610 | but we currently have the staffing to ensure that this is a place                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5605.0) |

|    5613 |  5616 | we can make it uniformed and we can have a place.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5613.0) |

|    5636 |  5641 | I've got a mint, and I get to ask a question.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5636.0) |
|    5641 |  5648 | So there was a question that I think is a concerning thing                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5641.0) |

|    5663 |  5664 | Let's make it about that.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5663.0) |
|    5664 |  5665 | I'm just kidding.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5664.0) |
|    5665 |  5670 | Second, I can't say that this was not within the scope of this report,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5665.0) |
|    5670 |  5674 | but I can tell you that to my knowledge, no.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5670.0) |

|    5677 |  5679 | and what investigations there are.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5677.0) |

|    5687 |  5691 | I mean, the comment was made, and I'd love for someone to answer.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5687.0) |
|    5691 |  5694 | Just to clarify, the resolution was brought forward because of the                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5691.0) |
|    5694 |  5699 | complaints from KPD officers, KPD officers who brought complaints                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5694.0) |
|    5699 |  5704 | directly to me because their complaints were not being heard.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5699.0) |
|    5704 |  5709 | The purpose of the resolution was to investigate what is going on that                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5704.0) |
|    5709 |  5714 | their complaints from what they were telling me were going up the chain                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5709.0) |
|    5714 |  5720 | of command and stopping at the law department and not being heard,                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5714.0) |
|    5720 |  5722 | not being dealt with.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5720.0) |
|    5722 |  5727 | Once I brought that to the HR director, she investigated it.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5722.0) |
|    5727 |  5734 | We had an officer who had complaints against him from the late 90s                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5727.0) |
|    5734 |  5739 | who decided to step down rather than to go through the investigations.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5734.0) |
|    5739 |  5744 | So those were the 30 years of complaints that nobody dealt with until I                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5739.0) |
|    5744 |  5748 | started screaming my head off and brought a resolution forward.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5744.0) |
|    5748 |  5753 | So it's really unconcerning to hear we've been doing things great.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5748.0) |
|    5753 |  5755 | There haven't been bad intentions.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5753.0) |
|    5755 |  5757 | We just have a lot of confusion.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5755.0) |
|    5757 |  5761 | That's not been what the experience has been over the last four years.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5757.0) |
|    5761 |  5763 | That's not what I'm hearing from city employees.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5761.0) |
|    5763 |  5768 | And that's not resulting when we have officers,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5763.0) |
|    5768 |  5770 | I don't know if there have been other staff members,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5768.0) |
|    5770 |  5775 | but officers who've left their position during an investigation of their                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5770.0) |

|    5779 |  5784 | Thanks.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5779.0) |
|    5784 |  5789 | I'll leave it at that and I'll defer to Councilwoman McKenzie now.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5784.0) |
|    5789 |  5791 | Councilwoman McKenzie.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5789.0) |
|    5791 |  5793 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5791.0) |
|    5793 |  5798 | So thank you for the extensive work.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5793.0) |
|    5798 |  5804 | The history was very informative and very concerning.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5798.0) |
|    5804 |  5810 | Just hearing over the years the steps that have been taken                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5804.0) |
|    5810 |  5815 | and the steps that have been undone by different administrations,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5810.0) |
|    5815 |  5820 | and I think it's just a sign of the times that we were living in back then.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5815.0) |
|    5820 |  5824 | But I also say that what we want to be very cautious of                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5820.0) |
|    5824 |  5826 | is making any hasty decisions.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5824.0) |
|    5826 |  5830 | And so, Director Drummond, I appreciate your timeline as far as                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5826.0) |
|    5830 |  5833 | training is concerned for your staff,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5830.0) |
|    5833 |  5837 | regardless of what decisions are made by Council.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5833.0) |
|    5837 |  5840 | I absolutely think that that should move forward and continue.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5837.0) |
|    5840 |  5846 | I do think that the timeline that was presented feels a little bit aggressive.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5840.0) |
|    5846 |  5848 | This is very important,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5846.0) |
|    5848 |  5852 | and to see that not only myself wasn't able to be here for the entire workshop,                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5848.0) |
|    5852 |  5856 | although I snuck and watched and listened to it,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5852.0) |
|    5856 |  5860 | I think it would be worth having for our colleagues that were not able to be here                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5856.0) |
|    5860 |  5864 | another opportunity to hear this information.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5860.0) |
|    5864 |  5868 | I have not had an opportunity to go through this report at all.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5864.0) |
|    5868 |  5870 | I doubt that by the 19th.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5868.0) |
|    5870 |  5871 | Maybe I will, maybe I won't.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5870.0) |
|    5871 |  5873 | I'm not sure.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5871.0) |
|    5873 |  5876 | As it relates to complaints,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5873.0) |
|    5876 |  5881 | I don't know if there is information that's available to Council                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5876.0) |
|    5881 |  5886 | that could just categorize complaints, what they were,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5881.0) |
|    5886 |  5889 | what they were related to, and outcome.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5886.0) |
|    5889 |  5891 | Even if that does not have names attached to it,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5889.0) |
|    5891 |  5894 | I think that that would be helpful for us as well.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5891.0) |
|    5894 |  5901 | And then my other concern is what happens when the complaint is on HR,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5894.0) |
|    5901 |  5904 | when it's related to an HR employee.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5901.0) |
|    5904 |  5909 | I know that we're talking about an EEO Deputy Director,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5904.0) |
|    5909 |  5914 | but again, that person is working very closely with HR, working in tandem.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5909.0) |
|    5914 |  5917 | And so I have concerns about that.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5914.0) |
|    5917 |  5922 | So I would like some additional information                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5917.0) |
|    5922 |  5928 | and an opportunity to do some reading this packet and some other things                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5922.0) |
|    5928 |  5930 | before speaking any further.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5928.0) |
|    5930 |  5932 | But as of right now, I'm not comfortable.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5930.0) |
|    5932 |  5938 | I think it's very aggressive based on the fact that we're just getting this workshop today                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5932.0) |
|    5938 |  5943 | and this information today.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5938.0) |
|    5943 |  5945 | And I'm just going to leave it at that for right now.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5943.0) |
|    5945 |  5949 | Councilwoman McKenzie, I'll jump in only briefly to say that we also recognize                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5945.0) |
|    5949 |  5954 | that the lack of a cohesive index of complaints and resolutions                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5949.0) |
|    5954 |  5958 | is one of the early gaps that was identified from the initial report                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5954.0) |
|    5958 |  5961 | that was prepared back in November of 2021,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5958.0) |
|    5961 |  5963 | and that led us to this deeper analysis.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5961.0) |
|    5963 |  5966 | Because, again, what we saw from that initial scan was that                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5963.0) |
|    5966 |  5971 | because there was confusion in our code and inalignment of responsibility,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5966.0) |
|    5971 |  5975 | those expectations for that type of reporting were not necessarily clear                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5971.0) |
|    5975 |  5979 | and that there was not a clear, again, chain of command,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5975.0) |
|    5979 |  5983 | as previous speakers have mentioned, to say who does what                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5979.0) |
|    5983 |  5986 | and what is the expectation, who is tracking,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5983.0) |
|    5986 |  5989 | and are they only tracking concerns that entered their door,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5986.0) |
|    5989 |  5992 | or are they also who is responsible for tracking concerns                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5989.0) |
|    5992 |  5994 | that may have entered through other doors?                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5992.0) |
|    5994 |  5998 | So, again, this analysis has helped us identify a path to consolidate                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5994.0) |
|    5998 |  6001 | and ensure that there's clear expectations                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=5998.0) |
|    6001 |  6004 | and therefore a clear point to track and measure                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6001.0) |
|    6004 |  6006 | and inform for that type of index.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6004.0) |
|    6006 |  6009 | So I appreciate your perspective because it is an important thing                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6006.0) |
|    6009 |  6013 | that we would argue, and I think outlined in November,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6009.0) |
|    6013 |  6017 | it didn't necessarily exist in the same cohesive citywide perspective                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6013.0) |
|    6017 |  6019 | that perhaps it ought to.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6017.0) |
|    6019 |  6021 | So thank you for that point.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6019.0) |
|    6021 |  6023 | And I appreciate your comments as well.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6021.0) |
|    6023 |  6026 | And what I will say is, for a point of clarity,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6023.0) |
|    6026 |  6030 | just as HR could be the appointed department,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6026.0) |
|    6030 |  6034 | there could also be an additional department that could be created                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6030.0) |
|    6034 |  6037 | that could be the stand-alone where everyone knows that that's where it goes.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6034.0) |
|    6037 |  6040 | And so, again, we're just getting this information,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6037.0) |
|    6040 |  6045 | so I'm going to reserve a lot more further comments.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6040.0) |
|    6045 |  6048 | But, again, I do have some concerns,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6045.0) |
|    6049 |  6051 | and hopefully looking through this information                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6049.0) |
|    6051 |  6054 | and some additional research may change that.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6051.0) |
|    6054 |  6058 | But as of right now, I do think that we're being very hasty                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6054.0) |
|    6058 |  6061 | and the timeline feels that it's rushed right now.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6058.0) |
|    6061 |  6063 | Thank you.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6061.0) |
|    6063 |  6066 | And if I may briefly, Councilman McKenzie,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6063.0) |
|    6066 |  6071 | just to your last point about what if there is a complaint against someone in HR.                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6066.0) |
|    6071 |  6074 | Policies that have been identified by other local governments                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6071.0) |
|    6074 |  6076 | and that we currently have in the city                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6074.0) |
|    6076 |  6081 | would allow a filing of a complaint with, as it currently reads here,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6076.0) |
|    6081 |  6084 | the civil service director or the law director.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6081.0) |
|    6084 |  6087 | Going forward, adopting these recommendations                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6084.0) |
|    6087 |  6090 | would mean that if in the limited circumstance                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6087.0) |
|    6090 |  6093 | there would be a complaint against an HR member,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6090.0) |
|    6093 |  6097 | the law department is always an option to fill those complaints, number one.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6093.0) |
|    6097 |  6102 | And number two, these city policies do not operate in a vacuum.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6097.0) |
|    6102 |  6105 | The city is still under the obligation to comply with state and federal law,                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6102.0) |
|    6105 |  6108 | which provides many other outlets for employees                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6105.0) |
|    6108 |  6111 | to pursue any allegations or complaints that they may have,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6108.0) |
|    6111 |  6115 | irrespective of city policy.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6111.0) |
|    6115 |  6117 | Thank you for that.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6115.0) |
|    6117 |  6124 | But I also know that there's also fear of retaliation and intimidation,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6117.0) |
|    6124 |  6127 | and not necessarily outward, but subtly.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6124.0) |
|    6127 |  6130 | And so I do know that there, over the years,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6127.0) |
|    6130 |  6132 | that there are people who have worked for the city                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6130.0) |
|    6133 |  6135 | and who now don't work for the city anymore,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6133.0) |
|    6135 |  6138 | either because they've retired or other reasons,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6135.0) |
|    6138 |  6141 | that have left the city and not felt that they were comfortable,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6138.0) |
|    6141 |  6146 | that they could trust that if they went to file a formal complaint                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6141.0) |
|    6146 |  6150 | that it would be addressed and they would be treated fairly and equitably.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6146.0) |
|    6150 |  6153 | And so let's not dismiss that that's not out there,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6150.0) |
|    6153 |  6156 | you know, to some degree with some employees.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6153.0) |
|    6156 |  6158 | And when we talked about the history, and I know my time is up,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6156.0) |
|    6158 |  6160 | but when we talked about the history,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6158.0) |
|    6160 |  6162 | I heard nothing mentioned about racial discrimination,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6160.0) |
|    6162 |  6165 | and those were during some very turbulent times,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6162.0) |
|    6165 |  6169 | when that was very prevalent and that was never mentioned.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6165.0) |
|    6169 |  6171 | And I don't know if that was, you know,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6169.0) |
|    6171 |  6173 | and people probably were afraid back then.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6171.0) |
|    6173 |  6176 | You know, when I hear that, yes, there was a person that was appointed                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6173.0) |
|    6176 |  6179 | by a mayor to sit as a clerk for that,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6176.0) |
|    6179 |  6182 | and then it gets voted, that person, that department,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6179.0) |
|    6182 |  6184 | that position gets voted out.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6182.0) |
|    6184 |  6187 | And so I just don't want us to be remiss to think that, you know,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6184.0) |
|    6187 |  6190 | everything is fine just because we're doing this                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6187.0) |
|    6190 |  6192 | and because we're talking about it now.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6190.0) |
|    6192 |  6198 | Those feelings still persist with some people within our, you know,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6192.0) |
|    6198 |  6201 | the city government who work for the city.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6198.0) |
|    6201 |  6205 | And so, again, this is why I think that I don't want us to be hasty                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6201.0) |
|    6205 |  6209 | in anything that we do, but, again, I'm one voice, one opinion.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6205.0) |
|    6209 |  6212 | But I do think it's imperative and important that our colleagues                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6209.0) |
|    6212 |  6215 | who have not had the opportunity to hear this presentation,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6212.0) |
|    6215 |  6218 | get this information, even those of us that are, you know,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6215.0) |
|    6218 |  6221 | haven't had an opportunity to read through it,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6218.0) |
|    6221 |  6224 | get another opportunity to sit before you guys                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6221.0) |
|    6224 |  6227 | and ask additional questions                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6224.0) |
|    6227 |  6230 | and maybe may have some additional recommendations                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6227.0) |
|    6230 |  6234 | or some things that could be modified as we move forward in this process                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6230.0) |
|    6234 |  6237 | because, again, we have to get this right.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6234.0) |
|    6237 |  6240 | I mean, this has been going on back and forth for many, many years,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6237.0) |
|    6240 |  6244 | and so I do applaud the fact that now it's being addressed                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6240.0) |
|    6244 |  6248 | because it's been, I mean, Mr. Zimbabwe has stood before councils                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6244.0) |
|    6248 |  6250 | probably for the last 50 years,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6248.0) |
|    6250 |  6253 | and this is what he's talked about and he's asked for.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6250.0) |
|    6253 |  6255 | And so now it's being done,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6253.0) |
|    6255 |  6260 | and I know that it's primarily prompted by Councilmember Parker's resolution,                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6255.0) |
|    6260 |  6262 | but it's always been there.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6260.0) |
|    6262 |  6264 | It's always been there.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6262.0) |
|    6264 |  6267 | So I'm grateful that it's being addressed now.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6264.0) |
|    6267 |  6269 | Thank you.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6267.0) |
|    6269 |  6272 | And I share the concerns that my colleagues have expressed                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6269.0) |
|    6272 |  6276 | about the aggressive timeline.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6272.0) |
|    6276 |  6281 | I do think this was an important first step for us today                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6276.0) |
|    6281 |  6286 | in looking at this report and getting this, like I said, very thorough report.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6281.0) |
|    6286 |  6291 | I'm glad that ultimately we had about seven of our nine members                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6286.0) |
|    6291 |  6293 | who were able to attend,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6291.0) |
|    6293 |  6296 | but people's schedules change and that happens.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6293.0) |
|    6296 |  6298 | So I understand that.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6296.0) |
|    6298 |  6303 | I think this is a very critical and important decision to be made                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6298.0) |
|    6303 |  6305 | about how we move forward,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6303.0) |
|    6305 |  6310 | so I do think we should return to this subject after some time to think.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6305.0) |
|    6310 |  6312 | So I agree with my colleagues.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6310.0) |
|    6312 |  6319 | I think what I was hearing a lot shared is what we want to make sure we end up with                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6312.0) |
|    6319 |  6326 | is a place where all employees know where they can go and it's not confusing                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6319.0) |
|    6326 |  6328 | and a transparent process.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6326.0) |
|    6328 |  6334 | And what I was hearing from Dr. Drummond and through the report,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6328.0) |
|    6334 |  6338 | I think the ultimate plan you're going to bring us will be doing that,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6334.0) |
|    6338 |  6341 | but I think we need to look into that further.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6338.0) |
|    6341 |  6345 | I think council needs some time to digest this and then look at that further,                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6341.0) |
|    6345 |  6350 | because I think we all have the same goal of what we're looking for here.                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6345.0) |
|    6351 |  6358 | The only other concern that I wanted to bring up was just from the review,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6351.0) |
|    6358 |  6364 | it sounded to me like the charter really reserves a lot of this EEO function                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6358.0) |
|    6364 |  6366 | in the executive branch.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6364.0) |
|    6366 |  6367 | Is that true?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6366.0) |
|    6367 |  6368 | Yes, that's correct.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6367.0) |
|    6368 |  6369 | Okay.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6368.0) |
|    6369 |  6371 | So in the charter itself,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6369.0) |
|    6371 |  6379 | are there any checks that exist on that authority that are mentioned in the charter                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6371.0) |
|    6379 |  6384 | or is that something that has to come in through administrative rules                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6379.0) |
|    6384 |  6386 | or some other ordinances?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6384.0) |
|    6386 |  6391 | There are limited checks through annual reports that I mentioned to kick us off                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6386.0) |
|    6391 |  6394 | to city council, for example, from a Title VI standpoint.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6391.0) |
|    6394 |  6396 | That's one key check.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6394.0) |
|    6396 |  6401 | There are checks on certain facets of discrimination complaints                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6396.0) |
|    6401 |  6404 | that you see through the merit board through allegations of discrimination                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6401.0) |
|    6404 |  6406 | in hiring, transfer, or promotion.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6404.0) |
|    6406 |  6411 | There is a check in that the merit board can assist with the development                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6406.0) |
|    6411 |  6413 | of an EEO plan.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6411.0) |
|    6413 |  6418 | So the merit board will have a say in the overall plan and how it's developed.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6413.0) |
|    6418 |  6421 | But in terms of the actual enforcement of the plan,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6418.0) |
|    6421 |  6425 | there are very few checks that are provided by charter.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6421.0) |
|    6425 |  6429 | And for that reason, as you'll see in reading the report,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6425.0) |
|    6429 |  6434 | they're within the legal opinions that have been promulgated for decades.                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6429.0) |
|    6434 |  6436 | While the charter may be silent,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6434.0) |
|    6436 |  6440 | attorneys will typically point to city council and seek guidance from city council,                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6436.0) |
|    6440 |  6443 | which is why it's important that we get this ordinance right                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6440.0) |
|    6443 |  6448 | and actually provide some guidance and enforcement authority in the code                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6443.0) |
|    6448 |  6451 | from city council that is charter compliant.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6448.0) |
|    6451 |  6452 | Okay.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6451.0) |
|    6452 |  6459 | And during your report, I think I heard you say that maybe some                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6452.0) |
|    6459 |  6462 | but not all protected classes were mentioned.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6459.0) |
|    6462 |  6464 | Was that part of what you had said?                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6462.0) |
|    6464 |  6467 | And so maybe one of these changes was to make sure that's updated                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6464.0) |
|    6467 |  6470 | so that all protected classes are discussed?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6467.0) |
|    6470 |  6471 | That's correct.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6470.0) |
|    6471 |  6477 | All protected classes are discussed and codified in Section 15-57 of the code currently.                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6471.0) |
|    6477 |  6482 | But whenever protected classes are cited in other city policy                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6477.0) |
|    6482 |  6485 | or in civil service merit board rules, not all of them are listed.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6482.0) |
|    6485 |  6489 | And that's just a product of time where certain policies have been revised                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6485.0) |
|    6489 |  6492 | more frequently than others, and the ones that have not been revised                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6489.0) |
|    6492 |  6494 | have not been updated to include every protected class.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6492.0) |
|    6494 |  6499 | So I would suggest that the easiest way to solve that problem                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6494.0) |
|    6499 |  6504 | is to keep Section 15-57 the way it is with all current protected classes                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6499.0) |
|    6504 |  6509 | and then every other policy of the city cite to that code provision.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6504.0) |
|    6509 |  6510 | Okay.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6509.0) |
|    6510 |  6513 | Well, I mean, obviously we want to make sure that update occurs                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6510.0) |
|    6513 |  6516 | because that's also very important.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230831?start=6513.0) |
