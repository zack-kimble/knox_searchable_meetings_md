| 0:09:05| to do I think a couple more times, maybe just even one more time, but as allowed by Governor Lee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| executive orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless I hear objection, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=550)|

| 0:09:25| So speaking of COVID, I have some good news to share. As most of you probably already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| everyone in the state of Tennessee who is 16 and up is now eligible to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| I think that's really good news. The other good news is that the vaccine is safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| it's effective, it's even effective against the new variants, and more and most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| it's now more widely available than ever, and you can sign up at vaccinefinder.org. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=587)|
| 0:09:57| I just want to say that a lot of different people and entities are providing vaccines. I got mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| through the health department, my husband got his through a local pharmacy, and my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| got hers at a hospital. There's a lot of different organizations providing it, and that's good news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| because the more people who provide it, the more accessible it is. And I also want to thank all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| community groups who are offering it. I know Vice Mayor McKenzie's been very involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| African American faith initiative to get and had a very successful vaccine event last weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=622)|
| 0:10:31| so thank you for that. One issue I wanted to mention is that a lot of people have told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| when I've been out in the community said, I'm going to get vaccinated, but I'm just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| wait till the other people get their vaccine and see what happens. I don't want to be a guinea pig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| So to that concern, I just want to let people know that as of yesterday, more than 670 million people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=647)|
| 0:10:56| around the world, and in the U.S. alone, 166 million people have gotten vaccines. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=656)|

| 0:11:22| one dose. So I'm really hoping that by May 1st, we can get up to 50% or more. So vaccinefinder.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=682)|

| 0:11:40| our Parks and Rec Department for helping me kick off a new program called CORE with Mayor Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| Our first event was just last night at Harry Tubman Park. Vice Mayor McKenzie joined us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| along with many other people from the community. We played tennis. We played a game that was new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| to me called Nine Square in the Air. We played a little basketball. There's art activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| and it was a beautiful day and a lot of fun. So CORE stands for Knoxville Outdoor Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=722)|

| 0:12:15| and what better place to do it than in our beautiful parks? We're hosting events throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| the city to encourage residents to spend 50 to 100 hours outside before May 24th. So by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=740)|

| 0:12:56| Another thing that's special about this month is we kicked off the Poetry in Motion. This is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| celebration of National Poetry Month. It's a collaboration with CAT, our poet laureate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=782)|

| 0:13:50| on her Instagram and on by riding our buses. Another thing that's happening next week is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| National Youth Violence Prevention Week, a reminder of the important work that is being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| and that is still that still must be done to support our young people. Our Community Empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=842)|

| 0:14:17| Harry Tubman Park, 3 to 5 p.m. This event involves several partners, including the Change Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| and will feature food, music by Sterl the Pearl, and information about area programs for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| The next day, kids are invited to the Phyllis Wheatley Center to make their own shirts promoting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| awareness for National Youth Violence Prevention Week. They're also a day set aside for writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| poetry and making videos and so much more. So check out the events calendar at KnoxvilleTN.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| slash Empower Knox. This will be updated as new events are added. Also look for special stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| throughout the week that will be posted on Empower Knox and City of Knoxville social media accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| Victims, friends, and families are speaking out in hopes of bringing an end to violence in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Thank you to all the organizations that are observing Youth Violence Prevention Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| And now, as you all know, housing supply and affordability are major challenges that we face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| as a community, and each one of you as a member of City Council play a key role in making policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| and land use decisions that impact how we tackle housing needs. The pandemic has only exacerbated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| the need for more affordable housing, and that is one of my top priorities as your mayor. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| something the city has invested significantly to address and one that we will continue to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| in next year's budget. The Knoxville Area Association of Realtors has recently completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| a local housing market report and is sharing those results with Knoxville area leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| So I invited Hanson Sale from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors to give us a very brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| presentation of these findings. I'm going to give a few minutes of my time today to Hanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| to share that report. Hanson? Awesome. Thank you for having me. And while we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| I'll go ahead and share my screen. And while we are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| months, April is also National Fair Housing Month. So I want to celebrate that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| But thanks for having me. And this report is really just intended to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| council members a broad overview of the housing market in 2020. And I want to preface that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| quite long, so I will skip over some slides, but I'm happy to make this available to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| after. So a high-level summary of 2020, we Knoxville saw record high home sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| which also resulted in record low inventory. We have seen that there's been a substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| supply-demand imbalance for years now, but that was exacerbated by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| We saw incredibly high demand, in part due to low mortgage rates, but also some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| pandemic disparities. So most of the economic impact of the pandemic was really concentrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| in the bottom quarter of the income distribution. And so lots of people who were potential homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| or already homeowners were deferring vacations, not eating out. So there was some sort of pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| savings there that is likely to have driven some of the demand this year. And likewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| we started the year with low housing supply, and that was unfortunately exacerbated. But overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| it's a very strong market, but a supply shortage and affordability is certainly a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| This is just a breakdown in the housing market this year. So we saw our inventory drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| by almost half, so almost 50% in 2020 alone. Home sales were up. We saw double-digit increases in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| the median sale price. And Knoxville even made Realtors.com's list of top housing markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| So that's of all U.S. metros. So Knoxville is performing quite well, but as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| inventory really is a concern. And this is a long-term trend. So this is not something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| happened this year. It really dates back to the financial crisis. We've seen a decade-long trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| of declining housing supply. But you can see in the last two years, and particularly in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| we've seen that trend sharpen downward. And just to put this into context as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| I wanted to index these just to show you that most of the trends in the Knoxville area are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| relatively similar in the city. So it's reasonable to suggest that most of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| trends would apply to the city that aren't just specifically city data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| This shows you home sales despite the low inventory. As of today, there was about 1,300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| active listings in the MLS in the Knoxville area, so that's 12 counties. But interestingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1146)|
| 0:19:15| housing sales in volume are actually up in 2021. That is likely not going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| throughout the year. Just at some point, this inventory, it's not sustainable to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| sell the volume of homes that we've seen sold in the last few years. But we are selling a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| portion of our inventory. So it is a strong market, but supply could very well wipe out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| some of the benefit that we'll see. And this is some interesting data from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| We've seen pretty, the median sales price, and this is partly a result of the supply issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1193)|
| 0:20:02| but we've seen a really strong price growth in Knoxville, particularly in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| that has sharpened in the last five years. So as you can see here, the median sold price in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| the city of Knoxville rose 45% just in the last five years. That was exacerbated in 2020, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1217)|
| 0:20:27| you know, it was a trend that was existing previously. So prices are rising very rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1227)|
| 0:20:36| CAR actually recently fielded a survey that sort of gave us some real-time data into exactly how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1236)|
| 0:20:45| voters are responding to these supply and demand issues. And this data is real-time from March 21st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1245)|
| 0:20:54| to the 23rd. And we found that one in three registered voters said that housing affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| in Knoxville was a fairly, a very, a fairly big problem. So voters are responding to this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| feeling it quite acutely. And about one in four said the same about the availability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| So obviously those are pretty interconnected, but a big issue here. This just shows you that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1274)|
| 0:21:23| employment growth in the city of Knoxville is growing much faster than housing units in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| population. Employment growth is also outpacing new construction. And this is a trend that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| seen for quite a while now. But I also want to note that this does not reflect some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| employment growth in surrounding counties. So for example, Morristown was recently named by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| the National Association of Realtors as one of the most underbuilt housing markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| in the United States. And so lots of the job growth in some of these surrounding areas are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| flowing in to the housing demand in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| Construction trends. We are seeing an increase in new residential building permits, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| There's been a large increase in multifamily housing. But the issue here is, yes, we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| increase, but we're making up for a decade of lagging behind in where we need to be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| amount of production that we need to house our workforce. Some demographic trends. The total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| population in Knoxville is projected to grow about 6% by 2025. And during the pandemic, lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| private data has actually borne out that Knoxville in particular saw a huge influx in new residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| And a unique part of this is that GDP was actually down in 2020, but personal income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| was higher on average, partly due to relief measures. And housing demand because of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| is going to rise accordingly, especially for the lower part of the housing price distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| And that's currently where there's the least amount of inventory. And so you can see there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| a rising share of homebuyers that are coming from out of state. Homeownership. We've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| homeowners have seen huge equity gains in Knoxville, which is a good thing. Some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| homeownership trends. The black homeownership rate in Knoxville is actually lower than the state and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| national average. And the white black homeownership gap specifically in the city of Knoxville is 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| points. So that's not something that you like to see. But one positive note is that we have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| some gains in the share of black homebuyers is growing in recent years. And also, we will expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| to see more households opting to rent just with prices and the sheer availability of home being an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| obstacle. And one thing to underscore here, too, is that really the prices are increasing, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| is not what is driving the affordability crisis. What is driving that is that our inventory is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1458)|
| 0:24:27| mostly at the upper end. So homes priced under 200,000 are virtually non-existent. So even with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1467)|
| 0:24:37| lower mortgage rates where it's, you know, more affordable to purchase a home, there isn't any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| inventory available. And so that is increasingly an issue. And I'll gloss over this. This just shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| some equity gains. This graph also shows the disparities in the homeownership rate by race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1491)|
| 0:25:00| And you can see the homeownership rate in the city of Knoxville is a bit lower, which is to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| expected in a city. But there is still a gap there, and that is low. And the black homeownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| rate in the city of Knoxville is lower than the Knoxville Metro, Tennessee, and United States average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| But like I said, the share of black homebuyers is growing. The rental market, new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1518)|
| 0:25:26| for multifamily homes is at the highest it's been in two decades. The rental vacancy rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| might rise just because of that. But we, from 2014 to 2019, the city did see a reduction in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| cost burden to renters, but the median rent is still rising much faster than the median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| This shows our vacancy rates are still trending downward, which is showing that our housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| production isn't quite reaching what demand is asking for. And this will show you as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| comparing rent to income trends. So median rent is increasing much quicker than the family income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| So challenges moving forward. The challenge ahead is a housing shortage. There is no sign of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| bubble, and there isn't really reason to worry about a bubble at the moment. Demand's likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| to remain high. But like I said previously, there could be a reduction in home sales just due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1580)|
| 0:26:30| supply side. And I just want to underscore that meeting the rising demand for housing really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| critical for Knoxville for us to remain affordable, but also to continue attracting new talent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| investment. And quickly, I'll just go through these policy considerations. Permitting fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| financial literacy and homeowner education, programs aimed at identifying and addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| vacant and abandoned properties, upzoning and rezoning, evaluating commercial zones for use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| as housing development, and expanding regional public transportation accessibility are all ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| that we can work to address some of the supply side issues. So that is what I have for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| and I am happy to answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1634)|

| 0:33:19| John Moore. Mr. Moore, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| I don't see him either. Caller, just raise their hands. I'll enable them to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| Okay. Who's speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Yes, this is Tony D'Amico. Sorry, I mispronounced your name. Mr. D'Amico,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| you're here to speak in favor of the appeal. You'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| Yes, so we're appealing on this sign variance. We're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2025)|
| 0:33:54| we have a 12-unit new development subdivision of residential townhomes off Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| And we basically have been told through the city that we can build the entrance wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| and landscape everything around it, but we can't have the actual letters of a sign on the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| walls. And we had it set to where we were going to do it inside all the sign restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| and, but we can't do it because we have less than 25 units. So we're basically just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| we want to appeal that and just see if we can, if there's any way we can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| you know, get this to where we can have some type of sign that gives us an identification purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2079)|
| 0:34:47| or identification for our new homeowners that are going to be buying these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| and also for emergency vehicles. So we, you know, we think that we should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2092)|
| 0:35:01| or be able to at least have one sign there that shows the name of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| And so what we're being told is that we can't. So the, and also that, I mean, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2106)|
| 0:35:15| we've been told that it has to be at least 25 units, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| not really, nobody's really given us a reason, or if we can have less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| it's just kind of just an arbitrary number. So really just kind of looking at having some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| you know, some options there on what we can do to provide these for our new homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| and the city off Dean Hill Drive. Okay. Thank you. I forgot at the beginning, if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| you have to please provide us with an address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| The address for this subdivision is 504. It's an address where you may be reached either at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2152)|
| 0:36:01| your home or office. Okay. Yeah. It's JT Development Groups, 234 Morel Road, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2161)|

| 0:36:23| Next person who signed up to speak on this is John Moore. Has Mr. Moore joined the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| Yes, I'm Tony's partner. I really don't have anything to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| other than, you know, I'm not sure where we're going to get with this, but I just wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| as developers in the city, I'm just not sure how, you know, the law went into the books for 25 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| like, like, what was the reasoning behind that? I mean, we're building $8 million worth of high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| end condos here. We can build the entrance sign and landscape and everything, but we just can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| put our name on there. It just seems very odd. So just if anything else, bringing it to y'all's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| attention that we know we feel like it should be definitely looked at in the future. We just feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| like we should have a name, you know, that's all. I mean, that's really it. Mr. Moore, just if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| could, are you at the same address as your partner? Yes, John Moore, 234 Morel Road, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2237)|
| 0:37:26| Okay, thank you very much. Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| this. There's no one who signed up to speak against it. Council Member Roberto. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| Mayor. I thought we'd start off by talking to Mr. Frost about the standards for council's review of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2258)|
| 0:37:48| variance. Mr. Frost, could you talk to us a little bit about that? Thank you, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| Roberto. Variances are found at Section 16.3 of our city zoning code. And if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2275)|
| 0:38:10| particularly parts E and F, standards and requirements for granting of a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| that's where you get into the heart of the situation. I'll briefly summarize what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| can find there in the standards. But in order to grant someone a variance, you're saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2306)|
| 0:38:37| strict application of the code would result in some sort of hardship. It says variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2317)|
| 0:38:47| will only be granted where such special circumstances or conditions, such as exceptional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| narrowness, topography, or siding fully described in the findings of the board, being this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| do not apply generally in the district. Variances will not be granted to allow use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| otherwise excluded from the particular district in which requested. And if a variance is given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| it must be for the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of land. You get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| requirements for granting a variance. The granting will not be contrary to the public interest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| the literal enforcement of the ordinance on the books will result in unnecessary hardship. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| the grain of the permit, contrary to the provisions of the ordinance, the spirit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| the ordinance will be observed and substantial justice will be done. But briefly, that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| summarization of 16.3 parts E and F of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2389)|
| 0:39:58| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Frost. Either one of the applicants, I understand what you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2398)|
| 0:40:09| talking to us about with regard to the sign. I think you probably just heard, as we all did as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| well, the requirements for council's decision on a variance here. Are there any special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| or conditions like we just talked about with regard to narrowness or topography or siding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| related to the sign that you're requesting a variance for? No, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Okay. Well, I mean, there's nothing along those lines. But I mean, you know, we already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| we had done a signed variance before and went in front of that board for that. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2443)|
| 0:40:54| they basically understood, said that they understood what we were saying and had questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| about the actual, you know, 25-unit rule, but it wasn't really their, you know, their point or their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2459)|
| 0:41:10| power to be able to approve this. So that's why we had to end up being or appealing to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| council on this. I mean, you know, basically our hardship, you know, and what he was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| our hardship is that, you know, we don't have any hardship based off of the topography or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| anything like that. But, you know, we're going to have 12 new homeowners in this new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| And we think it's a reasonable request to be able to have a subdivision name and identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2497)|
| 0:41:47| purpose on the front of the subdivision. And also for emergency vehicles, too. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| you know, that's kind of where we're at right now with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| Okay. I'll let my colleagues ask some questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Okay. Council Member Ryder and then Testerman and Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| Yeah. So my question is, the approach to the development is from Dean Hill Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| Yes. Okay. And you'll have a street sign there. It looks like it is it going to be Brunello Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| Brunello Way will be, yeah. Okay. So the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| will be addressed and we'll have a street sign there at Dean Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as far as we know, I mean, we think it will be at Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| at the front of Dean Hill Drive, in the intersection of Dean Hill and Brunello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Okay. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| But you'll have, you have a street with a street sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| Yes. But the street sign, the street name is different from the subdivision name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| But if I were to call Emergency 911, I would say I lived at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| whatever address Brunello Way, correct? Well, or they might be saying I live in Luso Villas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2583)|
| 0:43:11| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Can I get some clarification? I'm hearing two things. I'm hearing 25 units and then I'm reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| more than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| Is this the question for the department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| I'm hearing 25 units and then I'm reading more than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2608)|
| 0:43:36| Is this the question for the developers or for Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I mean, this is, um, Mr. Frost or somebody, can somebody clarify? I mean, I'm reading as a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2619)|
| 0:43:47| of this, it reads more than 25. I'm hearing 25. Just, can somebody clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2627)|
| 0:43:58| I'm hearing 25 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Council Member Hall? I was not present at the BZA meeting on this, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2642)|
| 0:44:13| Mr. Ahrens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Hi, there. Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections. I believe, I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| the code in front of me right now. I could look it up, but I believe the code says that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| the BZA, um, we have to have a subdivision under that. Um, those standards were established long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| before my time, and they've been in place for some number of years. The intent behind it is so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| we don't have a subdivision of one lot, of two lots, where we've got monument signs, um, scattered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| throughout for very small developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| You do have a number, if you drive down Dean Hill, you have a number of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| of developments that are very consistent. Um, you do have Glen Ives. You've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| you've got a number of them right there, and the reason I ask is because Glen Ives has 25 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| and they do have a monument sign. So, that's why I'm trying to get some clarification on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| is it more than? Is it, I mean, because, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| I will look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Okay. Um, and, you know, and it also looks from the size of the lot. I mean, unless you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2717)|
| 0:45:27| um, definitely do multi-unit. I mean, I, can that, can that development support more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| 12 units? Obviously, they might be bigger, but it's also substantially smaller than the other ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| um, that are adjacent to it. So, you know, I don't know if that qualifies as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| hardship just based on the size of the development or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| 12 units was the maximum amount we were able to get in there for, for the actual space of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| or the acreage of the, of the lot. I mean, that's what, just looking at it, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| you know, that's what I would gather. Um, again, I mean, I, I struggle with it because I, I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| that number is arbitrary, and we'll find out in a minute if Glen Eyes was consistent with that or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| not. But, um, you know, everyone else down that road does have monument signs. They're all quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2777)|
| 0:46:26| developments. I understand the inconsistency in trying to determine it, but I, I, I struggle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| it. Thank you. Councilwoman Kessler, I found the code section, and it does say for developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| with more than 25. So, that's the official, um, code language, and I can't speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| historic subdivisions that have exactly 25. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| so, again, I mean, I know it's substantially smaller. I think it, you know, the quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| um, you know, of the development is consistent with what's around it, and then if you do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| you know, two lots over, a development with 25 that doesn't meet the wording of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| of the code, I think that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you. Councilmember Testerman, Councilmember Parker, and then Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| I, um, I, I just wanted to state that I, you know, agreed with the, uh, some comments made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| from the board of Zion Fills. Mr. Rosenberg, Councilwoman Testerman just said this does seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| arbitrary. Um, it's unfortunate, you know, you all know I've struggled with this, uh, process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| in the past where we sit in this quasi, uh, judicial role, um, because folks are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| for a remedy, and we're not able to offer them one, even though we're the ones with the power to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| you know, in this situation, it sounds like we need to review that ordinance, um, and question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| why, uh, we've set it above 25, and this development wouldn't fit in. So I'm not able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| you know, support the appeal, um, but I would like for us to take action as a council to review this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| and perhaps this development could move forward, uh, with placing a monument sign, uh, in the near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| future. You know, there was discussion at BZA as who, uh, you know, could one parcel, could it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| just be two parcels that gets a sign, and, uh, if, if we're identifying a community, maybe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| should be open to that. So I think we should engage in more discussion and consider an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| change. Thank you, Councilmember Parker, Councilmember Roberto, and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| Uh, thank you, Mayor. Um, I was just going to make a motion to deny, uh, because I don't find a basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| to grant the requested variance based on our discussion and our review today. So I'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| that motion, and I'll let, uh, my colleagues continue the discussion. Okay, motion made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| deny the appeal. I'll second. Seconded by Council, made by Councilmember Roberto, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| Councilmember Smith. Mr. Smith, you have the floor. Yeah, I did have a question, um, to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| into this a little bit more. Is, uh, Director Brooks on? Um, we do have a signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| um, and I think that there are guidelines associated with this. Uh, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| can you speak to the 25 number as it relates to the history of it and how it compares to other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| um, related signed ordinance limits? Unfortunately, Councilmember Smith, I can't. I'm like Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| um, this was developed. I wasn't working in this part of the agency when, when the code was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| developed. So I'd have to do some research, but I'm happy to do that and can report back at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| later time. Okay. Like Councilmember Parker, I'd like, I'd be interested in understanding a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| bit more so we can help applicants in the future. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Smith. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| further questions or discussion? Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3017)|

| 0:51:44| local coaching and capacity building as we work to collaboratively identify evidence-based and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| community-informed strategies to address violent crime in Knoxville. There is one person signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3109)|

| 0:52:09| 11A. Sure. Hi. Please start by saying your name and address for the record. Sorry. Yes. Hi. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3129)|

| 0:52:22| Uh, thank you for having me. Thank you for your service, uh, to our community and for listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| to my plea. I am relatively new, so please take this with a grain of salt as I do not know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| what is being done in this matter, but I am here as a very concerned citizen about what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| in East Knoxville. I am in favor of 11A preventative measures. You may ask why I care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| Danger bleeds. It's just a matter of time that this will bleed over to other parts of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| if it is not solved. I've witnessed this in San Francisco and Cleveland, where I know individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| who have been shot merely walking down pedestrian streets. Racism or the ignoring of it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| pandemic. I have a niece at Bearden High School, and she has indicated that this is causing racist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| actions towards Black people, and there are growing concerns at her school. Black lives do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| matter, and in a time that made us realize that Black people are up against the odds in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| society, Knoxville has done little to help the weakest links by not acting. There's, and it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| result in more death to come. Bridging the economic divide is an act of God, and after all, thou shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| not kill is a commandment, and helping the poor is an act of Jesus, so let's do our part, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| should be our number one priority. We have to do more, and I have some ideas how to take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| that minimizes risk while maximizing the outcome. The answer I propose is love, education, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| opportunity through existing programs that are established throughout the USA. I have seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| work, and I have been part of it. These are proven programs that have been tried and tested across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| many cities. For example, one program is called yearup.org. I worked with them nearly 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| ago when they opened in San Francisco, helping young African-American kids to get tech skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| where they were then employed by companies. One of them I trained and worked with, got a customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| service job, which there are many of in Tennessee, and has been employed ever since graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| Without this program, this kid would still be in the streets of Hunter's Points around guns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| shootings. This yearup, this non-profit, now graduates nearly 5,000 kids a year with a $150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3254)|
| 0:54:23| million yearly budget over 20 cities across the country. I think we could bring them to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| There is another one called build.org, which teaches kids entrepreneurship skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Most importantly, build students develop a sense of urgency of their educations and careers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| while getting people in the community involved with them, because a big problem is in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| is that others may not get involved with East Knoxville, and these programs are concentrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| in our African-American and Latino communities. There are many more programs. One a friend of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| mine run called Street Soccer USA, which builds soccer programs in inner cities. There's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| one called outdoor wilderness training for inner city kids. They take kids out in the wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| and teach them wilderness skills. Wouldn't that be a great thing for Knoxville with all the outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| people here? More importantly, these programs get people in the community, in places like West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| Knoxville, involved with those who need it. They teach them the skills. If we want our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| prices to rise and more construction to come, let's fix our most vulnerable problem. Others not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| caring is a big problem. We do have to come up with our own solutions. We do have to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| that we are not wasting taxpayer money. We do not have to worry about whether or not these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| will work. They work because they've done it all across for the last two decades. These aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| feel-good programs. They work at a mental, social, and economic level. So we can't just dismiss these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| and say these are programs run by big liberal cities or cities that don't care because they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| worked across all types of apps. You may say we can't give handouts to people, but if people can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| get out of their traumatic living, then teaching them to fish means nothing. We have to give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| polls. Maybe all of them won't succeed, but even if 10 to 20 percent do, it will make their mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| So let's act now and make our mark. Let these preventative measures work. If we don't, we risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| that somewhere down the road kids are bearded or else we'll get shot. Even if it isn't one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| primarily white kids, more or less, more kids will die in East Knoxville, and that is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| responsibility. And if we don't act, what does it tell our kids? That we don't care? That black-colored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| lives don't matter? That other peoples who were given the opportunities we weren't don't matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| Is that what we tell our kids? Mahatma Gandhi said the true measure of any society can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| found in how it treats its most vulnerable members. So Knoxville City Council, how will we measure up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| We have the chance to show Tennessee and America, as a representative of the white majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| what we can do and that we do care. So let's make our mark and do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| Please fund 11A, and I'm here to help if you need any assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you, Mr. Davis. Council members, there's no one else signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| Any questions or discussion from Council? Council Member Singh, and then Fugate, then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you, Mayor. And thank you to the caller for bringing attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| I'm very excited about this contract. This is a great start. But all the programs that he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| talking about, I think all of that is prevention work that is not law enforcement and needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| funded. What I am really excited about is in the new infrastructure bill, there is $5 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3446)|
| 0:57:36| available to do this sort of work. So I'm hoping in Knoxville, we will do that. I think we need an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| organized collaborative strategy so that we're not just throwing money here and there at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| groups and thinking that we're going to solve it. But someplace where all the different stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| can sit down together, look at the data, and see what programs would work best. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| Thank you, Council Member Singh. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you, Mayor. I don't know if it's Deputy Mayor Gill or someone can answer some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3485)|
| 0:58:14| a little bit more about Cities United for the general public. I mean, there are people on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| call that may be very or on this meeting that may be very familiar with them. I went and looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| the website. There wasn't a list of cities that they've worked in in the past. I know that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| are a consortium. I mean, they represent lots of mayors from lots of cities. But if you could give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| us a little bit more background on who we're entering a contract with and exactly the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| I read it, it looks like they're going to be a convener to do some strategic planning to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| with then what we will execute locally. But if you could explain that in a little more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| I think that would be beneficial for the people listening. Sure. Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| Erin Gill, Chief Policy Officer. And I'll make a few comments and then also turn it over. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| have members of the Cities United team here today, including Anthony Smith, who is the Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| Director. So I would love for them to chime in and help provide some of that context. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| Cities United is a organization that works specifically with cities. So it is local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| government focused to address violent crime. And in particular, as they're addressing this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| of violence, thinking around it as, you know, when, and I think the caller articulated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| when boys and young men of color in particular, but youth in general, suffer from gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| their lives can be impacted both directly as well as indirectly. And so Cities United works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| with cities to take a holistic approach. And they have been for many years a partner of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| they know the landscape, they were part of the original conversation that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| I guess, more than five years ago now, related to Save Our Sons. And of course, we recognize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| need to not only think about boys and young men of color, but also young people in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| and in particular, those that have been recently impacted by gun crime and violent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| specifically. So we want to engage them as you articulated as part of a strategic planning step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| helping us convene those stakeholders locally and make sure that what we look to do in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| in collaboration with local partners is reflective of the best practices that they have seen work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| other communities. So without much further ado, I will ask Mr. Smith, if you're available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| provide a little bit of that overview of the organization. And in particular, if you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| provide counsel with a sense of the other cities that you have worked with and worked in, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| success that they have had with some of the strategies that you have helped them develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| Yeah, thank you. And good morning. Good evening, again, folks. Good to see you all again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Mayor and Council Members. I'm really excited that Knoxville is continuing this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| and continuing to move the work. I was also excited to hear, Mayor, you started the conversation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| have the person talking about housing, because that plays a big role when we start talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| what public safety is, and how we keep our kids safe, healthy, and hopeful. So Cities United has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| been around for 10 years. It was started by Mayor Landrieu and Mayor Nutter of New Orleans in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3679)|

| 1:01:31| thinking about a place for mayors and cities to come to build strategies to reduce the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| young people who are dying in our streets. Mayor Nutter and Mayor Landrieu at those times was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3698)|

| 1:01:47| can go to share ideas and best practices with other elected officials, mayors and other local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| elected officials. So Cities United has been on the scene, and we've partnered over the last 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| years with about 130 cities. We are right now partnering with, I believe, about 30 cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| deeply around building out their strategic strategy and their comprehensive public safety plan. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| every city to have a comprehensive public safety strategy that identifies the work, so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| not only know who's responsible, but are we making any progress. So we help cities not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3737)|
| 1:02:26| convene, but also work through the process of designing and implementing their strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| and what does it look like, and how do you do that, and how do you set up a system to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| We've had success in multiple cities, but again, part of the struggle, and you all know this, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| when leadership change, then some of the work goes away. So we're trying to get folks to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| long-term and long-term strategy, and think beyond the election cycle, and think about what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| the community to look like in 10 years, and really put together a strategy and a vision for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| community and our young people to say, we want Knoxville to look like this in the next five to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| 10 years, and this is what we're going to work on together. We really encourage cities and mayors to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| work in partnership with community, make sure community is at the table as they plan and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| design, and not only just community, but also those who are most at risk of being caught up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| the cycle of violence. So we want them at the table, helping not just to guide the solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| but lead the solutions and lead the work. So we spend our time really helping coaching and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| the capacity of the city, its staff, employees, to really be the ones who then lead and guide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| work, but making sure that they do that in partnership with the community and those most at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| risk. Some of the work that we do, we'll come in and do an assessment looking at what's already on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| the ground, what the gaps are, provide a report and some recommendations around that. I spent some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| with Knoxville thinking about which of the models are the best model to think about implementing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| your city, because you know there's multiple. Some cities take on all of them, some cities take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| some, but which one is the right fit at the right time, but also thinking through, you know, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| does it look like to have our SMART goals and our strategies in place, who's responsible for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| and how do we measure and monitor those. So we spend a lot of time there, really making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| that you all have the infrastructure to make sure that this work continues and that this work can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| successful and that everybody has a seat at the table. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Council Member Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3863)|

| 1:06:17| doing as far as like violence prevention. Anthony and I have been sitting on a couple of youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3977)|

| 1:06:29| building for youth entrepreneurship. How that came to pass was that a couple of people from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| of Denver talked to us about what happened in Knoxville with the Change Center. So they took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| inspiration from the Change Center, how it came about, the inspiration being that it came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4002)|

| 1:07:12| between other cities and Knoxville. So Knoxville, in a sense, has helped other cities in so many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| in violence prevention. Thank you. Mayor, if I could just say, I fully intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4038)|
| 1:07:27| Please don't take my questions as though I don't. I'm just trying to get more clarification for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| the larger folks who may not know as much about you, and I fully support the premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4052)|
| 1:07:41| that all good work is done by bringing all the stakeholders together on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| so that everybody moves forward united. So thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Fugate. Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4067)|

| 1:08:02| emphasize a few points. You know, when I was looking at the plan, you know, there's seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| steps. The first step was develop comprehensive public safety plan. I had concerns that I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| see stakeholders mentioned until step five, but I appreciate the description that you shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| Mr. Smith, of that process of developing that public safety plan. It sounds very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| inclusive of all stakeholders, so that is very much appreciated. One thing that just popped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| out to me, and I wanted to clarify, there is a, this funding is for package four, which seems to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4115)|
| 1:08:46| be focused on transition planning, a lot of transition planning. Is the idea behind this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4126)|
| 1:08:55| build infrastructure that then becomes its own standalone program outside of the city? Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4135)|
| 1:09:05| what that transition language is about, or can you help me with that part of the commitment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| Yeah, so right now, it's a both and. We want to make sure that the work is grounded in community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| and in the city, so we will be helping the city. Most cities are getting to a place where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| creating offices, right? So right now, we're a violence prevention that's focused on this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| and they have a team of staff of folks who do the coordination and the grant making for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| but then also making sure that there's a team of folks that the city's working with outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| So you're building an infrastructure where there's this, to your point, the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| are working in partnership around this strategic plan to make sure that it's all been implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| together, right? So everybody's playing their role. We never want to take city out because city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| needs to be at the table. It needs to be their part of the coordinating body, but also there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| a lot that happens in the community, so it'll be a both and council member Parker. And if you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| about the plan, the level four, there's a whole lot in level one, two, and three that goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| that around that assessment piece that we'll do up front, the peer-to-peer site visit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| connections that Andre just talked about, you know, the youth development strategy. So there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| a whole lot that will lead up into building that infrastructure and getting it ready for it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| able to sustain itself. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4224)|

| 1:11:44| community to help with violence prevention. As we all know, that work is so great. The needs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| extremely overwhelming and capacity building is very important in being strategic in how we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| that. So again, I fully support this primarily because we do have someone who is from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| who has actually lived in East Knoxville, who's experienced a lot of the things that some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| these young people are going through now. And his work with so many organizations that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| around for quite some time gives us a very unique advantage as it relates to working with Citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| United and as it relates to strategies. Andres worked with a lot of the organizations that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| been around for quite some time and doing the work. So I'm really looking forward to getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| this off the ground, getting groups of people at the table to look at those strategies and see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| which lanes people fit in. I'm looking forward to getting them some extended training as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| to some of the things that Cities United will be recommending as well. But I do want to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| take a moment to thank these organizations who have done the work and continue to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| while we're in transition with this contracting and taking our strategies collectively to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| level to help have a greater impact in saving our young people and helping families and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| communities. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Thank you, Andres. Thank you, Mr. Smith and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| members of Cities United for being here tonight. Any other further questions or comments before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| vote? Before you vote? Mr. Smith? Yes, Councilman? Just one additional comment. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4403)|
| 1:13:32| also want to express confidence in Mr. Conte as well mostly because the Change Center saw results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| and so that's what we're all after. And it's a good example of what can happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| good fruit that's produced, it's something new. And I think they did a study with the help of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| KPD that showed a year after the Change Center opened that in that zip code for the age of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| that they serve, for the hours that they were open, there was no violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| And I think when we think about these things, results matter and staying in power matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| And so that brings me to my second point that Mr. Conte will be very familiar with, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| some of these issues exist in South Knoxville as well particularly, and there are organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| across the city that are doing good work. And so while we all want something new because we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| to continue to improve, to Vice Mayor McKenzie's point, there's a lot of organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| like SEED, Boys and Girls Club, Big Brothers Big Sisters, some of these folks are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| good work now. And so I know you all bring them to the table, I just kind of want to elevate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| ongoing things. These folks have been doing this for years, they just need some more help and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| strategy. So we all want something new because what we have isn't enough, but we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| sure that we reinforce the existing folks because youth violence is complicated and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4500)|
| 1:15:08| starts with purpose and all kinds of things. So I just want to elevate some of those things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| thank you all for joining the fight. Can I jump in just for a second here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| Thank you, Council Member Smith. Mr. Smith, Anthony Smith, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. I just want to echo that because when we hosted our convening in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| we saw all the amazing organizations and you know, SEED was a site visit for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| still use the YWCA and their Young Men's Program to prevent state imbalance and connect them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| other places across the country. So we know that you all have a nice foundation of work and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| doing good work, you know, and part of that is just an assessment to figure out where the gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| are and how do we do that intervention work to make sure that we have folks who can get to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| young folks who are at risk at that moment and disrupt that and then help them get to a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4561)|

| 1:16:26| Just thinking about what else do we need to put in the mix and what's missing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4586)|

| 1:21:17| Mr. Thorne, can you just, for everyone's information, how many electric buses do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| have in the fleet right now? How many total buses do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| And what's the goal to electrify the fleet, percentage-wise or total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| Good evening, Councilmember Ramirez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| To answer your question, right now we don't have any electric buses in the fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| We're supposed to receive, take delivery of up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| We can't hear you very well, Mr. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| Yeah. Your microphone's a little muffled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| Just better? I'll talk really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| Yell into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| Currently, we do not have any electric buses in the fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| We are supposed to take delivery of up to 12 buses starting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| We have a total of about 72 buses total in our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| This application that we're applying through the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| it's a low or no vehicle program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| We're applying for six buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| These buses will replace diesel buses that are past their useful life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4938)|
| 1:22:26| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4946)|

| 1:22:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Okay. Motion carries nine zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| 11 F is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| necessary to apply for and accept a grant award from the state of Tennessee Highway Safety Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| in the amount of $5,000 with no required local match to provide overtime costs for a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| focused on high visibility enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5002)|
| 1:23:22| Motion to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Councilmember Ryder, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| Council, before you have a little discussion, if you want, I've asked Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| to provide a short overview of the next of eight grants from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| Highway Safety Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Item F through M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| Investing in safety is always important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| And I appreciate KPD for pursuing these grants to help make our city streets safe for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| types of users, including bicyclists and pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| So, Chief Thomas, could you just share a little overview of the next several this and several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| next agenda items, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5041)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this as traffic safety is just tremendously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| important to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| The first three items there, F, G, and H, actually have to do with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| And the next five have to do with community outreach programs that we are looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| funding for through the Tennessee Highway Safety Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| These are all grants that require no match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| The first grant that we had last year involved alcohol and impaired driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| That we did have last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| These run October through October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| And we spent about $24,000 in overtime on DUI safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| That has actually translated overall in traffic safety last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| We had 28 fatalities, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| However, the year before, we had had 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| So we had a 24% reduction in fatalities last year, even during the pandemic and lower traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| But however, if you look across the state and even across the nation, fatalities were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| up many other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| So we did have a bright spot there that we did not have an increase in our fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| So these are all programs that aim to keep those highway fatalities low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| High visibility enforcement has to do with overtime, again, for officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| DUI enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| DUI is something that we need to stop before it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| It can do tremendous damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| I know I've had to make notifications on DUIs that resulted in fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| And it changes lives when you lose a loved one for something that can be stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| Police traffic services, the one that's there for $140,800 is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| that's how we have in the past purchased our LIDARs, which is our radar enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| so that we can equip our officers with that technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| You probably see them out quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| The community outreach functions, these are fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| We have not applied for these before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| One there, you see bicycle and pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| That would actually be used at Safety City, where we teach our second graders regular programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| through the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| And we also open up Safety City during the summer holidays to families to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| and we teach pedestrian and bicycle safety along with traffic safety for the young kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| Travel passenger safety, car seat checkpoints, which we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| We have always just split the bill for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| And so they are offering a grant now that will assist us in paying our folks overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| paying their overtime when they do that as not a part of their normal duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| Again, community safety events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| We'd like to be able to, we're doing those right now over at our Fifth Avenue garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| which we share with the tech school, the tech services unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| And so there is a lot of moving around that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| So some of the equipment we'd like to purchase, easy ups, to be able to do those out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| in cones, traffic cones, to make it a safer event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| As you move on, the team driver safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| We are actually applying for that because we have our own program called TRAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| It was developed in about, we actually developed that when I was in the training or over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| training unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5240)|
| 1:27:20| And it's a teen driving program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| It stands for training, responsibility, awareness, competence, and knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| We noticed that a lot of schools were not teaching drivers training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| And so we decided that we needed to make up the difference in trying to teach our young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| people how to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| And my son has been through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| It actually gave him a lot of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| We teach, one of the things we taught that has been very beneficial is when you go off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| the road, how not to overcorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| We teach children in their own car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| They have to be 16 and have a driver's license, but we teach them in their own vehicle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| our trained driving instructors from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| And we usually pay those driving instructors overtime to do that on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| I know that Judge Irwin sends juveniles who have traffic issues to our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| It's been a great program, but we have flipped the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| So this would give us some additional funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| So the older driver's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| There is something called an elder fit, car fit program where older folks come and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| actually, as they sit in their vehicle, we make sure their mirrors are adjusted right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| We make sure that that car, the seat is adjusted right so they can see the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| I know that as I have aged, my driving has, I have to pay more attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| I can't multitask like I used to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| So we teach older drivers how to drive better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| Drivers that have been on the road for decades, and we teach them some new tricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| And then the safe communities, it just has to do with putting these programs all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| Part of these things, when we look at things that we'd like to buy as far as equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| a cargo trailer so that we can move these programs around and do them in different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| whether it be parks or school parking lots, not always having to do them over at Fifth Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5348)|
| 1:29:15| make them more accessible to the public because they are all great programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| That's a general overview of all eight of those grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| We had to break them down individually for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| So I apologize, you got to read through each of them and vote on each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| But if I can answer any questions, I'd be happy to any questions that you all would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5369)|
| 1:29:38| Council Member Parker, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| And then Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Yeah, one question I had was trying to understand what is a current program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5383)|
| 1:29:51| And what would be a new program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| Okay, so our current programs are the track program, the teen driving that we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| paying for, that this would enhance our ability to bring that to more students and pay for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| so that we could use our, you know, we wouldn't have to use overtime for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| And we would have equipment that we would be able to purchase for that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| cones, things of that nature, and materials, notebooks and things for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5411)|
| 1:30:19| Another program that we have, we have Safety City, this would just enhance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| we provide bicycles at Safety City for the kids to ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| Again, materials, helmets, we've had helmets donated in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| this would allow us to purchase those helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| You know, folding tables, chairs, easy ups to use there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| it gets very hot out there in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| But it's a great place to come and families love to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| The child passenger safety, car seat checkpoints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| child passenger safety, car seat checkpoints, we have been doing for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| We need, we'd like to do more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| This would allow us to train more people, send more people to the state for training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| and do more of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| So we have been doing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| The elder fit, we have not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| We had worked a little bit, I think with state farm insurance, trying to get some funding to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| that and we have never been able to pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| So we're hoping to be able to do that for our older drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| And so the only, and the enforcement issue, one in the past that we have currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| is the high visibility enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| So, or I'm sorry, it's the alcohol and impaired driving that we do have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| So that's the only one we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| We have not, we do not have the high visibility enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| or the traffic services at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Part of the reason I asked the question is, you know, we often talk about how overburdened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5492)|
| 1:31:42| our police department is already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| And so when there are new programs brought forward, my thought is, is there someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| who can do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| You know, can this be a program of public works or engineering or, you know, another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| department to engage in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Because, you know, despite many dollars committed and many efforts, I can't imagine KPD is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5521)|
| 1:32:11| to be up to its authorized force level anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5531)|
| 1:32:21| And so we have a reduced capacity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Would individuals engaged in these, let me not ask this question, but let me just make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5546)|
| 1:32:37| it as a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| It seems like individuals who are engaged in these programs are needed in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5558)|
| 1:32:46| And so that's my concern with expanding these several programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5570)|
| 1:32:50| So let me, if I could just speak to that for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| You know, as far as our authorized strength, we are right now at 377.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| We have 27 in the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| So we're going to run a, we're taking applications right now through the month of April for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| October Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| So we are hoping to get close to that number, hopefully by next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| It does take a year to train a police officer before they're solo on the street, just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| keep that in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| But the other thing I want to bring out, most of these programs now that the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| aids our enforcement, you know, if we get LIDARs, radars, that aids our current traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| services now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| It's equipment that they need to do their job now that we would not have to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| The older driver safety, the child passenger safety seats, we use civilian employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| They like to earn the overtime and gain those experience credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| And they, we actually have them trained to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| So these are offered to police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| The money wouldn't be able to use, be used anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| And we think we use it pretty judiciously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| And we have some pretty good, we're not going to get all these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| We'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| I don't think the state will give us all of this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| But we figure whatever we can get, we will use very efficiently and effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5644)|
| 1:34:04| The LIDARs, does it have license plate reading technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| Does it have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| No, ma'am, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| Thank you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| We'll go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| The information was shared all at once, but we'll have to vote separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Council Member Ryder, did you raise your, were you raising your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Yeah, I just had a quick comment, question for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| The TRAC program, which is the driver training for teens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| I just wanted to comment that I feel that's incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| And I'll have a lot of parents that will comment to me that their kids are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| other programs that might cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| And I know some of the council members that were elected at the same time as us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| we got to go out to the facility on the TRAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| where you're able to kind of simulate some situations like hydroplaning and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| which is why I believe KPD is involved in this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| I just kind of wanted to know, like, what information is out there in terms of marketing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| And can maybe we work with the city to improve getting that information out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| Just because of the number of parents I run into that aren't aware that that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| And kind of how many you run through the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| So we normally do about eight to 10 students one weekend a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| And, you know, right now that's all we can handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| We are losing money on the program, but, you know, we feel it's incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| As I said, my son has been through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| And it was amazing to me his driving skills and how it enhanced his driving skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5737)|
| 1:35:45| State Farm actually offered us a discount because he had been through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| Some insurance companies will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| We were working with State Farm to actually get some funding from them for a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| But they, I think you may remember, we came before council maybe about six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| They actually did not have that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| They chose to go in another direction because of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| So we were not able to obtain that funding from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| So this would help in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| So we would like to offer it, you know, more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| But we just don't have the capacity right now funding wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| I just I think it's really an important program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| And it makes our community safer for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| We all know people that have been in accidents and just making that more accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| It's one of the more affordable training options that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| that kind of offers the training you guys offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| And I will say, I know we all have stories about people we know that have been lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| or disabled due to car accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| You specifically mentioned overcorrecting when you go off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| My grandmother did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| My dad was four years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| And my dad, my uncle was eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| And he lost his arm in that accident as an eight-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| And there's just a certain way that you drive when you go off the road like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=5816)|

| 1:46:10| I just would like to get maybe a little summary of what this might be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| whether this would only be allowed on city property, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| Yeah, I forgot who was going to be answering this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| I can chime in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| And my colleague, Brian Blackman, and Charles may chime in on this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| but Brian Blackman set up the original goat grazing ordinance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| And so I'm going to kick it to Charles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| and then Brian is here to answer any additional questions about the program more broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6403)|
| 1:46:50| Can't really get into detail about the program itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| but this is simply allowing both sheep and goats to engage in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| clearing activities that are currently engaged in by goats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| You can contract, as I recall in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| private property owners can engage in a contractual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| to utilize these goats and utilize these sheep now to clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| sections of property that need to be cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| And it's certainly a more sustainable way of doing it than using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| chemicals and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| But maybe it would be better if I allowed Brian to give more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| about how the program works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| Thank you, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6453)|

| 1:47:47| So Council Member Thomas, to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| this would allow it on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| It's a temporary permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| And this came up from actually a suggestion from me to hear from a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| the community members that were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| So goats are very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| Obviously, in the last two years or so, there's a vendor out of Nashville that uses sheep almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| exclusively for similar application, and they just get out less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| So they kind of prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| So we heard from some residents here that were interested in having sheep instead of goats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| So this would allow both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| They're really just two different tools from the same toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| The goats will browse, so they'll crane up and they'll pull things out of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| and sheep will actually eat it lower to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| So two different approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=6517)|

| 1:57:12| we can perhaps help increase engagement in those processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7032)|

| 1:58:09| District. Eric Garcia Salas, Applicant, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| Mayor, do we have any speakers signed up for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| For J? No. Nobody signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| Yeah, this was a very close vote at the Planning Commission. It was 7-6. I went back and reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| the film. Also, the planning staff recommended to deny. And I would like, my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7111)|
| 1:58:42| they have to meet at least four criteria and meet all of them. So I would like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7122)|
| 1:58:50| Director Brooks about the reasons why the Planning Commission thought that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7130)|
| 1:58:58| appropriate to deny this. Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| Yes, I'm here. Good evening. So for this item, the Planning Commission did recommend approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7142)|
| 1:59:10| of the applicant's request to rezone the property from CG2 to CG1. I think some of them expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7150)|
| 1:59:23| concern, and this is not the only application they've expressed concern over this, was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| the CG2 and CG3 might have been over-applied with the updated zoning map. And that CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7169)|
| 1:59:39| I think you all have talked about this as well, should include design criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| which is not currently in the code. So the Planning Commissioners did vote in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7183)|
| 1:59:51| the applicant's request because they felt like there were conditions that had changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| that would warrant it and that it was compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| But the staff's position was to recommend denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7206)|
| 2:00:13| Councilman Thomas, Mr. Mullins is here representing the applicant, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| Yes, if Mr. Mullins would like to speak or take questions. I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| that the CG2 zones, which is what is currently zoned, has design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7224)|
| 2:00:35| And if I'm not incorrect, Ms. Brooks, CG1 doesn't have any design standards. So we would actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7235)|
| 2:00:45| rezoning from a zoning that had design standards to one that didn't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7245)|
| 2:00:55| And from the packet, it says CG2, which is currently designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| has a built-in zone between zero and 20 feet. CG1 has no front setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| CG2 has a built-in zone between zero and 15 feet. That's a corner side setback. CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7270)|
| 2:01:18| no side setback requirement. CG2 has minimum design standards for facade design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7278)|
| 2:01:28| fenestration design, and commercial cell design. And CG1 has no requirement for design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7288)|
| 2:01:37| Is that correct? Yes, that is correct. So the allowed uses are the same in all the CG zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7297)|
| 2:01:46| The difference is based on the dimensional standards that you just laid out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| Councilmember Thomas. And from the review of the zoning map, everything that I see around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7311)|
| 2:02:03| is CG2. So rezoning to CG1 would be a deviation from the zoning around it. There's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7323)|
| 2:02:17| residential R and 1 about a block away. So that's my concern, is we're rezoning from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7337)|
| 2:02:29| something that has some design standards to something that has none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| which of course would go to succeeding owners. And I'm not convinced that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7353)|
| 2:02:44| criteria for rezoning have been met. I don't really see any changing circumstances. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7364)|
| 2:02:52| it appears to me that it's it may be inconsistent with the the area around. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7372)|
| 2:03:02| I guess that's more of a statement than a question. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| I'll allow Mr. Mullins to speak or the well see Miss Councilwoman Ryder has her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7388)|
| 2:03:15| Councilmember Testament and then Ryder. And then if Mr. If you have a specific question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| Mullins, I think he's on the call as well. Mr. Mullins, did you want to address Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| Thomas's question? Are you on the call? I am Ben Mullins 550 West Main Street. I represent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7408)|
| 2:03:35| Ben Mullins 550 West Main Street. I represent the the applicant on this. If I may, I did send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7415)|
| 2:03:43| a letter to Mr. Johnson outlining our position for distribution on Monday. I do hope everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7423)|
| 2:03:51| has that. I don't know from Mr. Thomas's comments if you if you've had a chance to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| the letter that I sent out. This is something similar to the rezoning application that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7437)|
| 2:04:04| before this body last month for the Kingston Pike property where the applicant is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7444)|
| 2:04:12| seeking to put a very specific use on the property. And there's actually already a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| use exception that has been filed with the planning commission for this property pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| pending this rezoning. The intent is to place a take five service station on there, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7463)|
| 2:04:32| a unique concept in that the driver stays in their vehicle while four core services are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| performed. The conversation that we've had both with this one with planning commission and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7479)|
| 2:04:45| the prior conversation with Kingston Pike is that the uses are the same in all the C.G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7485)|
| 2:04:54| zones, but the application of C.G. two and C.G. three might have been over applied in certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| areas. And the issue with that is it's not really the dimensional the design standards per se for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7500)|
| 2:05:08| this because we do have a special use application that's going forward. And it's more of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7508)|
| 2:05:15| flexibility to do not have to be so close to the road. If we stayed C.G. two, we'd have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7515)|
| 2:05:23| either zero feet off of North Broadway there or 20 feet back, which makes it very difficult for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7523)|
| 2:05:31| automobile oriented businesses such as drive throughs and service stations to to operate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| to access. And if you look at the other uses in the area, I mean, we have all the other buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7538)|
| 2:05:46| there, including the building that's currently there, which is the old penny pond shop on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| location, which I think is now vacant. They're all set back further than than 20 feet. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7550)|
| 2:05:56| really trying to to look at what is there and put a zone there that is consistent with like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7556)|
| 2:06:02| Firestone service station across the street. There's a subway drive through. There's a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| of the pilot and it looks like it may have been a former Exxon. I'm not sure what it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| but those uses are all consistent with what's there. So they would allow us to build further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7574)|
| 2:06:21| back away to allow easier access. This isn't a very pedestrian friendly part of North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| It's right after you get off of the interstate 640 and get on to Broadway. And the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7587)|
| 2:06:33| zone you're talking about, that's on the other side of North Broadway. And there's another layer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| of commercial zoning before you get to that residential area. So I understand the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7598)|
| 2:06:46| about the lack of design standards. That was certainly something that we have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| both with this application and the one before. I do appreciate and I think Councilmember Roberto's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| resolution to go back and explore that, which is, I think, very welcome to make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| you know, we're not, as I think Councilmember Ryder has expressed some concern, building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| blank wall adjacent to the street. But that's not what's occurring here. I mean, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| special use application already in line. And you can see the renderings there that show what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| is going to look like. So it would meet the administration's design standards that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| currently in place with CG2. It just allows us more flexibility to build further back from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| road and make it automobile oriented. And so, you know, this is a new business. The Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| is the first location in Tennessee, I believe, for a Take 5 service station. This would be the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| So we'd like to encourage that, encourage the flexibility to do that. And again, the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| it was a close vote. But the I think the issue is with the new zoning ordinance with recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7668)|
| 2:07:56| you know, how much, you know, thought was placed in placing CG2 versus CG1. I think Mr. Hill and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| some others did think that maybe there was some over application of CG2 and 3 that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| revisited. And, you know, recode's a living document. You know, the change of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7690)|
| 2:08:17| is recode itself and creating a zone that forces construction that's inconsistent with what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7697)|
| 2:08:25| already there. And so I think that's the that speaks to the design the elements on changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| the zoning. So we would ask you follow the recommendation of Planning Commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| approve this rezoning. When we went through Kingston Pike, Planning Commission is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| close vote. It was not in our favor. So I think the more we talk about these issues and the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| the Planning Commission educates themselves on these issues, they're starting to come around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| with maybe revisiting this at least now on a case by case basis until maybe there can be a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7729)|
| 2:08:55| global review on design standards for CG1. So I hope that addressed your request, your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| Council Member Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Mr. Thomas, if it's okay, I'll move on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7742)|
| 2:09:11| next council member. If you have further questions, yeah. Council Member Testerman and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| Yes. And then Parker. I think that was just my point that Mr. Mullins brought up is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| this was in front of us a month or so ago at Winston Road and Kingston Pike after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| discussion and we passed that rezone, I think, 9-0. And I think this is virtually identical to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7766)|
| 2:09:34| that situation and what was before us. So I think I, you know, understand I struggle, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7774)|
| 2:09:44| being inconsistent in this matter when we're dealing with the exact same thing and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| point of CG2 and 3, you know, maybe not being the most judicious with recode, you know, in matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7789)|
| 2:10:00| like this, especially on a heavy corridor like North Broadway and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7800)|
| 2:10:10| Thank you, Council Member Testerman. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| You're muted. You're still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7813)|
| 2:10:24| Did the same thing. Ms. Brooks, could you describe for everyone what CG2 would produce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7824)|
| 2:10:34| Kind of the criteria, what type of building it would produce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| And what type of building it would not produce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7837)|
| 2:10:46| Ms. Brooks, you're also muted. I'm going to take a recess after this. I think we need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7846)|
| 2:10:54| CG2, as Council Member Thomas laid out, there are dimensional requirements as well as design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7854)|
| 2:11:01| requirements. So the building should be within zero to 20 feet of the front building line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7861)|
| 2:11:12| And CG2 also has minimum design standards in regards to facade, fenestration, and then just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7872)|
| 2:11:22| commercial site design in general. I can't speak to specifically what this particular development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7882)|
| 2:11:28| would look like under the CG2. I haven't analyzed it for that. But the intent is, the intent of the CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7888)|
| 2:11:36| district in general is to be more pedestrian oriented, and the CG2 and CG3 are getting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| more of that, creating that environment that is more pedestrian friendly. So parking towards the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| rear, the rear and side of the building, instead of in the front, which you see typically along our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| auto-oriented corridors. Does that answer your question? Yeah, I think, so when we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7913)|
| 2:12:02| free code, you know, the idea was that we would create more walkable communities. But the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7922)|
| 2:12:10| that I have is that it has been applied so broadly that we're now limiting out businesses that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7930)|
| 2:12:17| would want in these areas. For example, I live not far from Central and from Broadway, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7937)|
| 2:12:24| drop my car off and walk home. So there's a benefit to be able to have businesses like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7944)|
| 2:12:33| that are suitable for you to be able to drop off your car and go home, or be able to get to without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| having to drive to someplace like Flint Highway, to be able to get that type of car service. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| when I look at the map for this, that particular side on the opposite side of Broadway, or like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| Hotel Street that's up near Fountain City Park, I know that, you know, we need the standards that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7971)|
| 2:12:59| we have in CG2 and CG3. Those are across Broadway. It's abutting residential areas. But on this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7979)|
| 2:13:09| it's abutting Highway 441, which is five lanes there. And then behind that is an entire shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7989)|
| 2:13:17| center. So there's a great amount of land there that's on CG2. And my understanding is that CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| allows us to go up and create more mixed use. And that seems to be a large, dense swath of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8003)|
| 2:13:34| And then we're limiting out these businesses. But some of them exist right there. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| it's not that the use isn't allowed, it's that the dimensions don't fit. So I see a need to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| little tweaking of the standards. And when we discussed, you know, CG1 and having no standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| I think you can build something with no standards that looks pretty awful on a small lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| but also too on a large lot. So I think when we make this decision, and so we have some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| that are revised, we kind of have to look at what the request is, how big the acreage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| kind of apply it. So I would be in favor of this when I look at the, you know, how far this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8051)|
| 2:14:20| from residential, and how much CG2 there is on that side, how far back it goes from 441.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8060)|
| 2:14:30| So I just see some revisiting to both CG1 and CG2. The other thing I would say about CG2 and CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8070)|
| 2:14:37| is one of the other things is we haven't put a requirement for mixed use in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8077)|
| 2:14:43| which was one of the reasons that we went that direction. For example, the rezoning request on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| Asheville Highway that went CG1, we gave it, it passed with the CG1, which doesn't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8088)|
| 2:14:56| standard. So we've talked about that. But it also has zero requirement for any percentage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| residential. So I'd like when we discuss this in the future to include that as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| conversation. Is that something that would, you know, fit in? I'm not saying that it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8105)|
| 2:15:12| I just, if you're going to ask for that zoning so that you can put residential and mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| then there needs to be some balanced percentage, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder. Councilmember Parker. And then I can go back to Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| Thomas. Did you guys still have a question? Mine was actually already stated that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8129)|
| 2:15:36| similar project has come before us on Kingston Pike. So I think, in all fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8136)|
| 2:15:44| we should be, we should keep that decision in mind. Okay, we'll go to Councilmember Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8144)|
| 2:15:52| since he hasn't had a chance to speak, and then back to Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| You're on mute. I would just echo some of my colleagues that I feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| you know, I voted against the Kingston Pike matter. And I think we've reached a critical mass where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8163)|
| 2:16:09| these types of corridors require a new look by planning. And I'm convinced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8169)|
| 2:16:18| we probably need more flexibility for these types of businesses. And so while I'm not a big fan of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| spot rezoning, I feel like we again have reached a critical mass where we need to provide some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| flexibility. And until then, we should apply our judgment consistently. So I've been convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8189)|
| 2:16:37| that this makes sense, generally speaking. Thank you, Councilmember Smith. Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8197)|
| 2:16:45| Yes, there seems to be an assumption here that this is identical to the last vote that we took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| And that's not right. That's not correct. The last vote we took, there was a much more of a mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| zoning around that area. And here you have consistently CG2. So this would be a deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8218)|
| 2:17:11| to the present zoning in this location, not necessarily on Kingston Pike, but in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8231)|
| 2:17:18| And I voted in favor of the one on Kingston Pike. With this one, you've got an area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8238)|
| 2:17:28| all CG2. There's no CG1 in it. And we're deviating from this particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8248)|
| 2:17:35| what's surrounding it, to go from a zoning that has some standards to a zoning that doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8255)|
| 2:17:44| any. And the purpose of the recode and the zoning was to, as a couple people mentioned, was to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8264)|
| 2:17:55| this more pedestrian friendly. And this may be an incremental step, but it's still a step in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8275)|
| 2:18:02| right direction of making these commercial corridors more pedestrian friendly. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8282)|
| 2:18:12| I don't think that the applicant has met the criteria, the four criteria that all four has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8292)|
| 2:18:22| to be satisfied. And they're using as the criteria for substantial change, a change in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8302)|
| 2:18:32| Now, generally, when we use criteria as a substantial change, it's with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8312)|
| 2:18:40| area or different commercial interests that have come or a growth. But I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8320)|
| 2:18:51| that it's proper to use a change in the law, which, you know, defines the way we should approach this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8331)|
| 2:19:00| as the change in circumstances that meet criteria one. There's no change in circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8340)|
| 2:19:10| other than we've passed some restrictions to make the place a little bit more pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| So I just simply don't believe that they have met the criteria. And it is difficult, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8357)|
| 2:19:24| I think the planning staff got it completely right. And maybe this needs to be addressed by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8364)|
| 2:19:34| you know, looking at design standards in CG1. But the law as it is, and what is before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8374)|
| 2:19:43| on this location, not on Kingston Pike, but on this location, I don't think that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8383)|
| 2:19:50| met the criteria. And, you know, we have to, I think, have a beginning when we make these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8390)|
| 2:20:02| more pedestrian friendly, or if we keep making exceptions and, in my opinion, denying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8402)|
| 2:20:10| the ordinance, then we're never going to make these things any better. And this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| incremental. So I'll allow my colleagues to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8417)|
| 2:20:25| Council Member Roberto and then back to Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| Thank you, Mayor. I certainly sympathize with my colleagues' struggle on this one, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8428)|
| 2:20:38| we've mentioned a lot of times about the Kingston Pike version of this in the Second District. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8438)|
| 2:20:45| so I completely understand the thought process that Council Member Thomas is going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8445)|
| 2:20:53| because I really went through the same thing. And where I ended up seeing this was noticing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8453)|
| 2:21:00| that we really do need design standards in the CG1. And that led very soon after that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8460)|
| 2:21:11| resolution that Council passed. And I think the first step I would look at is with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8471)|
| 2:21:17| maybe with Director Brooks. Council had passed a resolution asking for Planning Commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8477)|
| 2:21:25| consider design standards in CG1. Where are we in that process? I know that was not that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8485)|
| 2:21:35| Director Brooks? You're correct. It wasn't that long ago. We have not begun that process yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| Okay. But that is moving forward. I think the other part that I looked at, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8500)|
| 2:21:48| in thinking about my colleagues' comments, were about walkability. And of course, I support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| too, and would want to see more walkable areas, you know, throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8514)|
| 2:22:02| When I looked at this as well, I went back and looked at some of the most walkable areas in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| second district. And they're actually the same zone. If you go to Bearden, you can see that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| most walkable parts of Bearden would be zoned this way as well. I don't know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| specifically. I'm just letting you know where I was when I was making the decision on the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| project. I think that the and maybe this is a good question for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8547)|
| 2:22:35| When there was a close vote on this with regard to this zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8555)|
| 2:22:42| was the lack of design standards in CG1 one of the issues that came up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8562)|
| 2:22:50| Director Brooks? Yes. I was trying to remember. I don't recall specifically that they spoke in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| great detail about that. Of course, it was mentioned because it's been talked about in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| the past in terms of the dimensional standards and the design criteria. And, you know, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8578)|
| 2:23:05| they talked about what you all have mentioned here this evening, which is taking a closer look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8585)|
| 2:23:12| all the CG2, CG3 zones. But there wasn't a lot of discussion about dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| my recollection. Okay. Well, for consistency, I think I would be supportive of this. Certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8598)|
| 2:23:28| want to, you know, make some comments and walk you through my thought process, Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| when I was dealing with this before. You know, I do think that we need those design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8614)|
| 2:23:42| in CG1. I think those are being worked on. And I'm glad that we took that action when we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8622)|
| 2:23:49| But anyway, I hope that helps as you're making a decision here. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8629)|
| 2:23:57| Thank you, Council Member Roberto. We'll go to Council Member Testerman and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8637)|
| 2:24:03| You're on mute. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely tough. You know, I go back to actually on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8643)|
| 2:24:14| the Kingston Pike, it didn't have CG1 in that block at all. I think I recall that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8654)|
| 2:24:22| But just looking at the type of business, I mean, CG2 doesn't allow for any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| drive-thru. And just for the nature of the business, you know, the rezoning would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| necessary. And I think that, you know, you're on a state highway as well, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8674)|
| 2:24:41| again, like Kingston Pike, you know, it's the traffic count. And just unfortunately, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8681)|
| 2:24:50| the majority of zoning along state highways like that is consistent with what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| in the rezone. So, I mean, again, walkability, I understand, is important as well. But too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8697)|
| 2:25:06| that was a good point of Council Member Roberto. I mean, Bearden is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| and has a great walkable community as well. So, it's just, you know, again, I kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8710)|
| 2:25:20| I go back to the consistency factor. Thank you, Council Member Testerman. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8720)|
| 2:25:28| Is Mr. Ahrens on the call? Peter Ahrens? He was earlier. Mr. Ahrens, are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8728)|
| 2:25:39| He's not present anymore. There might be someone else here who can answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| So, my question is, what does it take or what limits it from the property or the parcel? Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8745)|
| 2:25:55| it the size of the parcel because of the setbacks to be able to have the pull-through concept to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| able to have auto service? I've already been addressed, but if someone would humor me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8762)|
| 2:26:11| like what necessitates Mr. Mullins maybe not to call you? Mr. Mullins, can you speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8771)|
| 2:26:20| please? I can, and again, if you have the letter that I provided to the recorder, we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8780)|
| 2:26:27| concept plan that we filed, and just being able to be that further away just allows there to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8787)|
| 2:26:34| a greater turn radius, especially for a lot this size. It's a smaller lot, and if we have to be 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| feet up to the right of way, then it just really makes it difficult to turn from and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8800)|
| 2:26:49| North Broadway into the lot and into where the car shop is, where if you can set it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8809)|
| 2:26:58| it gives you more flexibility for there to be more of a turn radius. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| the building is closer to North Broadway, and there's less reaction time for a vehicle to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8824)|
| 2:27:12| come into the lot and then come into the car shop. That actually creates a potential conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8832)|
| 2:27:20| with any pedestrians that might be in the area. So, I mean, this is not the type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8840)|
| 2:27:26| use where there's a lot of parking needed. Again, the concept is the individual stays in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| vehicle while they get their oil changed or while they get their wipers changed or some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| filters, and then they're able to then drive back around and out, and the flexibility of being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| to be further back actually makes it a safer way to approach the business on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8862)|
| 2:27:53| So, the issue that I have and that I see with recode, when you look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| and I've pulled up on KGIS Kingston Pike, which was all of the downtown West area all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8879)|
| 2:28:07| West Mall is CG2. And when you look at Broadway, it's all of Fountain City all the way down through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8887)|
| 2:28:15| to basically Fifth Avenue, Central Broadway, Apex is CG2. And we have a lot of businesses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8895)|
| 2:28:24| are car oriented, which we do want more walkable buildings, and we do want to be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8904)|
| 2:28:32| mixed use. CG2 allows 70 feet tall to be able to get those residential units above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8912)|
| 2:28:42| But I have an issue with not allowing the car businesses because my neighbors and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| we drop our cars off and we take our cars to get serviced closer to our homes. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8928)|
| 2:28:54| I don't want to be in a position where we're forced to go further away to have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8934)|
| 2:29:01| service on our cars. And that's where I struggle with saying, this is how this zoning is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8941)|
| 2:29:09| be. And we're only going to have a certain type of building for miles of Broadway. And so, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8949)|
| 2:29:19| makes me hesitant to stick with the rezoning we gave in recode throughout that entire corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8959)|
| 2:29:28| So, that's my comment. Thank you, Councilmember Ryder. Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8968)|
| 2:29:34| Ms. Ryder, I respectfully say that there's many places on Broadway you can get your oil changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| you know, because I do that as well. So, it's not going to be a huge burden to not have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8980)|
| 2:29:48| particular place. The business chose this place and it's like it may be on a smaller lot than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8988)|
| 2:29:55| they would like, but I haven't heard anybody say that it's prohibiting them from putting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=8995)|
| 2:30:01| business there. It may not be as easy, you know, but to rezone this property permanently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9001)|
| 2:30:11| to allow them a 20-foot setback when it's not consistent with the CG2 around. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9011)|
| 2:30:22| want to underline, we keep talking about how like we've already voted the exact same vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| out on Kingston Pike and this is not the same thing. It's a different location and it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9027)|
| 2:30:33| different set of circumstances. So, just because something is similar doesn't mean it. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9033)|
| 2:30:41| supported the one on Kingston Pike, but this one, if we're going to make any kind of progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9041)|
| 2:30:48| in making areas, commercial areas, more pedestrian, we can't ignore the law as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9048)|
| 2:30:59| and vote to rezone something that's a deviation in that particular area. The surrounding area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9059)|
| 2:31:09| not consistent with the surrounding area. The requirement for change circumstances is not met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9069)|
| 2:31:16| here. Just because we've increased a code, you know, or an ordinance doesn't mean change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9076)|
| 2:31:23| circumstances. That almost always means like growth around the area or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9083)|
| 2:31:29| I'm convinced they haven't met the criteria under the ordinance. The planning staff had it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9089)|
| 2:31:36| And, you know, if we're going to start taking, you know, steps to make commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9096)|
| 2:31:46| more aesthetic and more walkable, then we got to start doing it or else they're just going to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9106)|
| 2:31:56| as ugly and congested as they are, although functioning in a certain way. So, I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9116)|
| 2:32:10| feel comfortable rezoning this to a level where there are no design standards and it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9130)|
| 2:32:17| in my view, meet the ordinance's requirements. But I think what we all have are in agreement on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9137)|
| 2:32:26| is we definitely need to revisit this and look at the problem here that's probably going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| to rear its head and look at why in the world CG1 doesn't have any standards. And I'm just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9153)|
| 2:32:45| willing to rezone something from CG2, which is consistent with the surrounding area, to CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9165)|
| 2:32:54| which at this present time has no design standards. So, this is tough, you know, and I understand all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9174)|
| 2:33:04| viewpoints, but I think the planning staff got it right and I'm going to move to deny this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9184)|
| 2:33:10| application. Thank you, Councilmember Thomas. Director Brooks, did you have a comment? Your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9190)|
| 2:33:18| hand is raised. Yeah, thank you, Mayor. And I apologize, I'm stepping back a couple comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| This is to address a question that Councilmember Ryder had raised about the drive-throughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| specifically. And the section in the code that relates to drive-throughs is 9.3.F6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9207)|
| 2:33:35| And so, it's specific to the location of those drive-throughs. So, it's not specific to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| actual district, but it's the requirements for the drive-through where they must be located on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9220)|
| 2:33:46| lot. Thank you, Director Brooks. Councilmember Thomas, I'm sorry, were you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9226)|
| 2:33:53| I don't think we actually have a motion on the floor. I apologize for not. Yes, I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| So, Councilmember Thomas has made a motion to deny the rezoning. Is there a second? Yes, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9238)|
| 2:34:06| Frost. Actually, and Mr. Swanson can correct me if he disagrees. I think Councilmember Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9246)|
| 2:34:16| wants to approve the CG-1, which was considered by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9256)|
| 2:34:27| No, I want to deny. Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. Do you want to approve CG-2? I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9267)|
| 2:34:35| Yes, I want to approve CG-2 per the recommendation of the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9275)|
| 2:34:43| So, the motion on that Mr. Thomas is proposing is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9283)|
| 2:34:52| deny the rezoning. Yes. So, is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9292)|
| 2:35:03| Councilmember Singh, are you indicating that you're seconding that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| Yes, I am. Motion is seconded by Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| Mr. Thomas, just to make sure everybody understands, because I think Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| might have confused me a little bit. So, your motion would be to deny the rezoning. The rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9316)|
| 2:35:24| as written, it's to go from CG-1 to CG-2, and you're saying that would deny this. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| a yes vote on this would be voting to keep it as CG-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| Yes. I misspoke. I misspoke. Okay. All right. Are there any questions or comments on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9334)|
| 2:35:43| Councilmember Ryder, and then Testerman. Am I allowed to ask a question of Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| from the comment that she just had, or am I only allowed to ask a question of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| I think it's... The question hasn't been called. It was just a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9353)|
| 2:36:01| so we're generally discussing it. So, Ms. Brooks, do we have a sense of, when we talk about CG-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| on both sides of the corridor of the full length of Broadway within the majority of the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9368)|
| 2:36:15| do we have a sense of how many of those drive-throughs and pull-throughs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| legal, non-conforming after we've changed the zoning to CG-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9379)|
| 2:36:25| No, I don't... No, we haven't looked into that, Councilmember Ryder, but I'm not sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9385)|
| 2:36:32| the zoning district would make them legal, non-conforming. I have to look into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9392)|
| 2:36:39| but I mean, the section that I referenced is specific to drive-through facilities themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9399)|
| 2:36:44| so it's not specific to the district. That makes sense. No, I understand, but we made the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9404)|
| 2:36:51| No, I understand, but we made the entire corridor CG-2, which is a specific set of standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9411)|
| 2:36:59| that majority of everything built along the corridor doesn't meet the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| So if someone said, I guess this is the part where it would be great if Mr. Ahrens were on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9423)|
| 2:37:10| I want to pull a permit and I want to revitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| this building here, how many of those parcels are going to have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9433)|
| 2:37:18| We're just not going to see those businesses, and as I guess, is that the goal of RECODE is to make...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9438)|
| 2:37:24| I'll just refrain from my comments. I just... Anyway, wide changes, and I'm not sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9444)|
| 2:37:32| meant to get miles and miles of downtown-style buildings, as much as I'd like to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9452)|
| 2:37:38| abutting some of the residential areas. I'm not sure I agree to have that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9458)|
| 2:37:47| Every single parcel, all the way through the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| You're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| Sorry. Two things. I would like to ask Mr. Mullins, going back to, you know, if this doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| move forward, then what are the... What's in store for this business? I mean, is it doable otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9491)|
| 2:38:21| If you could answer that and have another...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| Thank you. Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| I appreciate that question, and my understanding right now, we don't own this property. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| looking at doing a long-term ground lease on this property, and my understanding is that if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9511)|
| 2:38:39| zoning isn't in effect, then we would need to look somewhere else, because in order for our concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| to work with the way the traffic needs to flow through and around our automobile shop, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| are relegated to being 20 feet or closer to North Broadway, it just wouldn't work from an engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9530)|
| 2:38:57| standpoint. Okay, and I guess back to Councilwoman Ryder's point, too. You know, I think just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9537)|
| 2:39:07| sheer fact that CG2 and CG3, if you want to put that in there, from the over-application of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9547)|
| 2:39:15| and, you know, the design standards were clearly omitted in CG1, which we're now in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9555)|
| 2:39:22| of addressing, and recode has always been, I think as Mr. Mullins said earlier and I've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9562)|
| 2:39:29| I mean, it is a living document. We knew when recode happened that we would have to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9569)|
| 2:39:35| there would have to be some modifications, but is it fair in the meantime to penalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| property owners, because there has been an over-application of certain zoning, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9582)|
| 2:39:51| again, I think CG2 is going to make it very difficult, especially along these busy corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9591)|
| 2:39:57| to have, you know, the variety and multi-use of businesses that, you know, a community needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9597)|
| 2:40:07| and should have and be privy to. So, you know, I think, too, that's where I struggle, that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9607)|
| 2:40:16| we've got to be willing to modify, I think, especially when something's been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9616)|
| 2:40:22| you know, over-applied in this case, I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9622)|
| 2:40:29| Thank you, Council Member Testerman. Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9629)|
| 2:40:34| Yes, just a comment. My understanding from the comment of Mr. Mullins is that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9634)|
| 2:40:40| actually doesn't even own the property right now, and it might be better advice for him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9640)|
| 2:40:49| put the business where it fits with the existing zoning instead of going to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9649)|
| 2:40:57| where the lot is very small, and we have to change the zoning to a zoning that has no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9657)|
| 2:41:09| May I comment on that, Mr. Thomas? Yes, of course, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9669)|
| 2:41:12| Thank you. I appreciate that. I know you guys are discussing it, and the issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| we're looking at the market that we're trying to serve, and there's a need for that. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| there are other automobile shops in that area, but nothing with this type of concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| We've invested a lot of time in market research and engineering on this, and there's just not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9687)|
| 2:41:32| lot of EG-1 zoning that would allow this type of concept available, and that's part of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9692)|
| 2:41:39| we're looking at is there's an absence of that, especially in the markets that we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9699)|
| 2:41:44| move into. So, ground lease is investing money in the property just as if you're going to own it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9704)|
| 2:41:52| for a long period of time, but this contract is contingent upon that, so it would really put us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9712)|
| 2:41:59| in a pickle in trying to find something else, especially with, you know, I think most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9719)|
| 2:42:05| businesses there are more than 20 feet back away from the right-of-way, so it's not discordant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9725)|
| 2:42:12| what is already there, and so I understand your point, Council Member Thomas. I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9732)|
| 2:42:19| conversation on this, but, you know, respectfully, I do think that this rezoning is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9739)|
| 2:42:29| at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9749)|
| 2:42:34| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| I'll just say one more thing, I think. Yeah, Mr. Mullins, I understand your situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9756)|
| 2:42:44| and even though a lot of the businesses do have the 20-foot setback, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9764)|
| 2:42:53| intention of RECODE was to start slowly, incrementally correcting that so that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9773)|
| 2:43:01| quarters, business quarters would look better and be more pedestrian-friendly, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9781)|
| 2:43:10| I don't think we can use that as a standard that just because everything there is already in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9790)|

| 2:43:31| it may make it a bit more difficult for you to put a business here, but I haven't heard anyone say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9811)|
| 2:43:39| yet, well, maybe I did, that it would prohibit you from doing it. At least that wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| said at the Commission meeting. Basically, what was said there was it would make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| if they could get the setback, it would make it easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| but no one at the Commission meeting said it would be prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| Thank you. Okay, thank you, Council Member Thomas. The motion on the floor is to deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9836)|
| 2:44:08| rezoning. It's been made and seconded. I don't see any further questions or comments. Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| Vice Mayor McKenzie. One more question, Mayor, if I may. How long has this property been vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9854)|
| 2:44:21| up to this point? Mr. Mullins, can you speak to that? I'd have to go back and look. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9861)|
| 2:44:28| it's been vacant for a while. There were several different businesses that went in there. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9868)|
| 2:44:32| it's an older building. It's a dilapidated building. It used to be a penny pawn shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| Everybody remembers the giant penny sign there on it as you're going down. There was a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9876)|
| 2:44:42| and maybe a small grocery store there, but the business is there. The building is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9882)|
| 2:44:49| it's not usable. There needs to be something else there, and so revitalizing this underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9889)|
| 2:44:57| piece of property through this business. Okay, Vice Mayor McKenzie, did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9897)|
| 2:45:08| I guess, Vice Mayor, I guess she's, any further questions or discussion? Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9908)|
| 2:45:19| Thank you. I just want to ask, how long of a lease are you guys looking at for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9919)|
| 2:45:26| My understanding is it's a 99-year ground lease. That's typical for what you see for a ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| lease. I mean, it's a long-term investment. I'm not involved in the acquisition side of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9931)|
| 2:45:38| on the rezoning, but that's my understanding. We're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9938)|
| 2:45:42| you know, typically, a ground lease is for 99 years, so if it's less than that, I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9942)|
| 2:45:47| surprised. Okay. All right. Vice Mayor told me that she needs the link again, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9947)|
| 2:46:01| Her laptop died, and if you could resend her the link, she'll be able to sign back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9961)|
| 2:46:07| or maybe text it to her. She might have to sign back in using her phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| Mr. Johnson, can you handle that? I'll do my best, Mayor. Okay. Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9971)|
| 2:46:20| Yes, Mayor. I was just going to suggest, since we had a member who isn't connected right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| do you want to go ahead and take that break now? I think that's a great idea. It's 846. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| reconvene in 10 minutes. 856. See you in 10. Okay, Council. It is 856 now, so I'd like to call this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=9991)|
| 2:46:40| meeting back to order. Just as a note, I would normally never call recess while in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| of deliberating an agenda item, but with the Vice Mayor's technical problems, it seemed like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10005)|
| 2:46:52| that was, on balance, the better thing to do, so her internet connection was interrupted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10012)|
| 2:46:58| and while she was in the middle of asking a question to Mr. Mullins, Vice Mayor, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| would restate the question, and if Mr. Mullins is still on, he can attempt to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| All right. Thank you, Mayor, and my apologies, Mayor and Council, for that disruption. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10029)|
| 2:47:15| inquiring Mr. Mullins. I know that you mentioned that the building had been vacant, and it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| been in several uses over the years, but it sounds like it's in a very poor condition to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10040)|
| 2:47:27| What is your estimated investment that you were looking at making into this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10047)|
| 2:47:33| Well, we're looking at doing the, again, I confirmed with my client over the break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10053)|
| 2:47:38| that the ground lease is 15 years right now with renewable options, so I wanted to make sure I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| that clear. I was not prepared for that question, so I apologize. I don't want to tell anybody any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10064)|
| 2:47:50| misinformation, but as far as the overall investment, I mean, the 15-year grant, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10070)|
| 2:47:55| know the exact numbers, but it's going to be substantial, and you're talking about high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| six figures with the development of the property, the site plan. Right now, I mean, we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| had site plan work. We've already filed our application for special use approval, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| shows the layout, the franchise fees, and the demolition, and then building everything back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10091)|
| 2:48:19| in. It's going to be, I don't know if it would be excess of a million dollars, but you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10099)|
| 2:48:25| at something on high six figures at least. Okay, and thank you for that, and so I asked that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10105)|
| 2:48:33| question because, you know, it sounds as if we've got a property that's somewhat blighted to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| point, and what is the probability that we would see someone else coming along anytime soon to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| make such a major investment? I'm also struggling because we see that it was, this was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10126)|
| 2:48:52| approved by the Planning Commission, and I think it may have been either council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10132)|
| 2:48:57| Ryder or Testerman who actually talked about, you know, during the RECO process, we knew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10137)|
| 2:49:03| there were going to be situations that we would encounter that would need to be looked at or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10143)|
| 2:49:10| given some type of grace, if you will, and so with that said, I'm really struggling with this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10150)|
| 2:49:18| especially since it did have the approval with the Planning Commission, and we have a group here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| who's willing to make substantial investment on that property, and so thank you, Mr. Mullings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10163)|
| 2:49:30| That's it for me, Mayor. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10170)|
| 2:49:38| any further questions or discussions before we vote on Mr. Thomas's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10178)|
| 2:49:42| Okay, seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10182)|
| 2:49:50| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| No. This is your motion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10194)|
| 2:49:58| This is your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| Sorry. Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| Wait, yeah, let's, maybe Mr. Johnson, let's clarify, the motion on the floor is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10202)|
| 2:50:08| that Mr. Thomas promoted. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| I'm voting the affirmative is to deny the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10213)|
| 2:50:19| If you vote no, you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10219)|
| 2:50:22| It's a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10222)|
| 2:50:23| Does everyone understand the motion on the floor that you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| Mr. Thomas, do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| So Mr. Thomas is a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| Yeah, yes to deny the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10232)|
| 2:50:37| Yes on your motion. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| So, Mayor, okay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| So an ordinance to rezone property located at 4821 North Broadway from CG2 District to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10243)|
| 2:50:53| The motion is to deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| The motion that Mr. Thomas made is to deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| So a yes vote is denying that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10258)|
| 2:51:02| He made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| Actually, I think there was never an original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| This is the first and only motion that we've been discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| Okay, it's just not what's on the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| It's a denial of what's on the, on the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| So yes vote is to deny the rezoning and no vote is to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10279)|
| 2:51:25| Well, we'll see what the vote is and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210406?start=10288)|
