| 3:04:39| 7-V-17-RZ is also a request of David Hobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| It's for rezoning from A Agricultural to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11083)|
| 3:04:46| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| I recognize the applicant and the property owner is still being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11090)|

| 3:05:23| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11123)|

| 3:05:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| On the 3.1 acres, what are you planning to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| We've got several different people looking to come into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| There's a tire center looking to maybe do a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11144)|
| 3:05:48| It's really not 100% nailed down yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11148)|
| 3:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11152)|
| 3:05:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11153)|
| 3:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| Seeing no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11157)|
| 3:05:58| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11158)|
| 3:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11159)|
| 3:06:00| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11161)|
| 3:06:02| I want to make sure that we're clear, clarify what we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| So they can still build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11165)|
| 3:06:08| We went to Neighborhood Commercial and that's like down to 5,000 square foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| They can still build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| The only thing they've got carrying on them is the landscaping and appearance from outside, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11174)|
| 3:06:20| And the signage and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11182)|
| 3:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11183)|
| 3:06:24| So it's a good fix for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| I want me and Ed to be clear kind of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| But I think it's a good fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| And Mr. Hobbs has other buildings in the area and lives in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| So I have confidence that he'll get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| I'm moving far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| So it's important to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11204)|
| 3:06:45| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11208)|
| 3:06:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| Thank you, sirs, for being here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| And good luck in your endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11218)|
| 3:06:59| We're not going to charge you the extra rent for being here long either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| No, we've reduced the seat rate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| 7-C-17-SP is a request of Victor Jernigan for Southwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| from LDR low density residential to MDR medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11234)|
| 3:07:20| located north side of Canton Hollow Road east of Woody Drive in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11240)|
| 3:07:26| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11246)|
| 3:07:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11247)|
| 3:07:28| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| Victor Jernigan, 10255 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11250)|
| 3:07:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11255)|
| 3:07:36| Ms. Brooks, a report to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| MPC recommends amending the Southwest County Sector Plan to MDR medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11259)|
| 3:07:45| and recommends the Knox County Commission also approve the Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| A vote of 12-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| Is there anyone else wishing to speak this evening to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11271)|
| 3:07:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| Randy Pace, 554 Valley Hill Lane, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11281)|
| 3:08:06| Do you wish to speak first or do you want the applicant to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| I would like Mr. Jernigan to have the opportunity to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| Thank you, Mr. Pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11294)|
| 3:08:18| I've asked the Commission to approve the rezoning that was recommended by the MPC Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11298)|
| 3:08:26| The conversation Mr. Pace spoke earlier in the public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11306)|
| 3:08:31| and Mr. Pace is certainly speaking against this zoning because it's on the new Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11311)|
| 3:08:40| Knox County Engineering has done a phenomenal job in repositioning what was a county road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11320)|
| 3:08:47| to fix a very dangerous intersection at Woody Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| The County Engineering Department has come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| They've rebid the entire project and cooperated with numerous different departments in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11333)|
| 3:09:00| to come up with bike paths and a walking trail, which are in strong demand in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11340)|
| 3:09:05| and a sidewalk on the north side of the road where this property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11345)|
| 3:09:09| that I'm asking for the rezoning to eight units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| This is a transitional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11352)|
| 3:09:14| This property is completely surrounded by the Concord Mobile Home Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11354)|
| 3:09:21| which has an RB zoning where tomorrow morning you could go in and build 12 units an acre if you chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| I'm asking for a planned zoning at eight units an acre on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11367)|
| 3:09:32| I'm involved in the property directly across the street from this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11372)|
| 3:09:40| as I rezoned it last year, to five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11380)|
| 3:09:43| So this transition on this 3.7 acres is perfectly suited for what is happening on the new Canton Hollow Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11383)|
| 3:09:51| with the ability to move from the new design certainly will make it one of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11391)|
| 3:09:56| if not the safest roads in all of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| Again, I ask you very strongly to approve the MPC Commission recommendation on my rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11399)|
| 3:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11406)|
| 3:10:13| Commissioner Wright, members of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11413)|
| 3:10:18| I live in the development adjacent to the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| I attended the MPC's public hearing regarding the sector plan change and the change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11422)|
| 3:10:28| During that hearing, I asked that any decision be delayed as there was another public hearing scheduled the following week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11428)|
| 3:10:37| as it related to a proposed road improvement project on Canton Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11437)|
| 3:10:42| And we spoke about that previously this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| I also objected to a change in density as it was not consistent with the southwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11445)|
| 3:10:53| It was not my intent to prevent the change in zoning or development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11453)|
| 3:11:02| I have communicated with staff and elected officials regarding this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| I have attended several community meetings and met with residents and professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11467)|
| 3:11:12| I've also reviewed all the comment cards from the public meeting regarding the Canton Hollow Road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11472)|
| 3:11:19| We've taken the time to compile a list of concerns that I and other residents have regarding the MPC's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| I ask that you consider these concerns in your deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| The public's right to be informed regarding the road improvements prior to making decisions that have a direct impact on traffic and public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11491)|
| 3:11:41| The use of spot zoning to achieve MPC goals regarding community development as it relates to walkable communities and affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11501)|
| 3:11:51| The lack of professionalism of the MPC chair as it relates to public concerns and their understanding of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11511)|
| 3:12:00| The impact that an increase in density has on the number of school age children brought into the school zone in an already overcrowded sending district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11520)|
| 3:12:12| The lack of clarity in the numbers estimated for the increase in number of school age children added to an already overcrowded sending district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11532)|
| 3:12:20| To wit, Mill Creek Manor is another development on Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11540)|
| 3:12:27| The applicant applied for 40 homes. They are currently under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11547)|
| 3:12:34| Those 40 homes were to add 25 school age children to that school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11554)|
| 3:12:41| Mr. Jernigan's application was for an increase in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11561)|
| 3:12:46| We haven't gotten to the development stage so we aren't certain how many homes will be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11566)|
| 3:12:53| The potential is as little as 32 and as many as 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11573)|
| 3:12:59| The estimate from the MPC for the addition of school age children was 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11579)|
| 3:13:05| The lack of clarity provided the public regarding the installation of sidewalks, bike lanes and bike paths on a roadway that has historically been classified the most dangerous road in Knox County without substantially improving the lane width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11585)|
| 3:13:22| The lack of clarity in the actual cost of improvements to Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11602)|
| 3:13:28| The lack of any supporting evidence that installation of sidewalks, bike lanes or bike paths are appropriate based on the established design standards of the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11608)|
| 3:13:40| Tennessee Department of Transportation and Knox County Planning Commission or the location and number of residents to be served with the installation of those sidewalks and bike paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11620)|
| 3:13:53| Lack of consideration for existing new development and future development on the current safety of Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11633)|
| 3:14:00| Lack of consistency and accuracy of the information being provided the public concerning the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11640)|
| 3:14:07| The impact on local neighborhoods and properties during development and road construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11647)|
| 3:14:14| Our recommendations are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| Encourage the MPC to consider all stakeholder information and concerns when reviewing applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11657)|
| 3:14:25| Encourage the MPC to reduce to writing and include in their written report the rationale for decisions that deviate from established planning and development norms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11665)|
| 3:14:38| Discourage the MPC from making decisions based on ideological goals or objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11678)|
| 3:14:45| Encourage the MPC to treat the public with respect regardless of any perceived lack of knowledge or understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11685)|
| 3:14:53| During a previous application, during that same hearing, the chairman or chairwoman of the MPC admonished a resident because he didn't understand what a sector plan was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11693)|
| 3:15:05| had not attended meetings and the application he was in front of the MPC to speak to was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11705)|
| 3:15:16| Consider a review of the process by which the MPC board, Knox County school board members and county commission communicate enrollment numbers and their impact on development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11716)|
| 3:15:30| Provide the public with a comprehensive justification for the addition of sidewalks and bike paths to the road that has historically been identified as dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11730)|
| 3:15:41| To include the standard under which that decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11741)|
| 3:15:48| An associate professor at UT in civil and environmental engineering published a report for the Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11748)|
| 3:15:58| a framework to predict high risk roadways for pedestrians in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11758)|
| 3:16:05| I would submit to you that that report and standard engineering practice would increase the danger to the public by adding bike paths and sidewalks to this stretch of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11765)|
| 3:16:21| The minimum development standard for new road construction and this classifies under the Knox County guidelines as new road construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11781)|
| 3:16:33| where significantly improving sight lines and changing elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| The minimum width is 32 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| The Knox County engineering department has indicated to me and in their proposed plan that the road width is only going to be increased to 22 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11800)|
| 3:16:52| That 22 feet along the 1.8 miles of Canton Hollow Road already exists along a substantial portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11812)|
| 3:17:02| I would also ask that the total cost of the project for just the installation of bike lanes and sidewalks would exceed 20% of the total project cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11822)|
| 3:17:18| That in and of itself represents further consideration by the engineering department as to the wisdom of the actual installation of those facilities at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11838)|
| 3:17:31| The concerns over the approval of construction of developments within the southwest sector is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11851)|
| 3:17:37| An annual report does indicate dangerous roads are being created by the lack of proper planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11857)|
| 3:17:45| The MPC's lack of consideration for infrastructure costs and completion of infrastructure projects are creating dangerous situations throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11865)|
| 3:17:57| Not to mention an increased burden on the schools and county administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11877)|
| 3:18:02| I look forward to your responses. I will remain available to you and the public going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11882)|
| 3:18:08| I'll close with the fact that several members of the public have expressed a great deal of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11888)|
| 3:18:20| I've met with them. We've done a number of neighborhood and community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11900)|
| 3:18:26| They asked that I come and address their concerns as well as my own at this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11906)|
| 3:18:32| Knox County Planning Commission's own staff recommended disapproval of the increase in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11912)|
| 3:18:42| It doesn't fit with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11922)|
| 3:18:46| Amending the sector plan in Knox County to meet the ideological goals for what's going on in the city of Knoxville simply doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11926)|
| 3:18:57| It's 1.8 miles of a rural road. It is an arterial, it is a connector, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11937)|
| 3:19:05| I am in favor of widening Canton Hollow Road to meet design standards, but I'm not in favor of adding sidewalks and bike paths along that stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11945)|
| 3:19:19| The right-of-way won't permit it and it reduces the actual increase in safety on Canton Hollow Road that would be achieved by making the road the proper width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11959)|
| 3:19:31| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11971)|
| 3:19:35| Is there anyone else present this evening wishing to speak to county sector plan amendment captioned 7C17SP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11975)|
| 3:19:51| Hearing none, Mr. Jarnagan, as the applicant, do you wish to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11991)|
| 3:19:58| I do want a couple of points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=11998)|
| 3:20:03| Mr. Pace talked about the possible minimum density, maximum density that the property could hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12003)|
| 3:20:10| My application was extremely clear. It said 8 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12010)|
| 3:20:13| All of my handouts that I provided to the MPC were at 8 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12013)|
| 3:20:18| The difference in the staff's opinion, my opinion, is a total of 11 units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12018)|
| 3:20:24| The MPC commission, and I believe I've sent everybody a copy of the video for the discussion that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12024)|
| 3:20:32| was very informed and questioned many aspects of the situation before they voted strongly in favor of my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12032)|
| 3:20:43| This is a medium density residential in a planned residential zone where nothing can happen on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12043)|
| 3:20:49| until I take a plan back to MPC for its review and additional public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12049)|
| 3:20:56| I do ask for the opportunity to do that by you as commissioners please approving my request and as supported by the MPC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12056)|
| 3:21:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| Mr. Pace, do you wish to respond and please be brief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12067)|
| 3:21:13| I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| Again, I'm not opposed to Mr. Jernigan being able to develop the property. Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12075)|
| 3:21:22| I applaud the Knox County Engineering Department for their work on the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| I applaud MPC for their deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| However, the paid staff recommended against and MPC board approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12091)|
| 3:21:39| Mr. Jernigan's contention that it's surrounded by a mobile home park is not completely accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12099)|
| 3:21:49| There is a mobile home park on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12109)|
| 3:21:53| Two sides if you consider one mobile home park as surrounding a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12113)|
| 3:22:04| Again, the idea that I'm opposed to Mr. Jernigan being able to develop the property is inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12124)|
| 3:22:14| I simply want it to meet the sector plan requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12134)|
| 3:22:22| Now, commissioners, we're moving to the phase of are there questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12142)|
| 3:22:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12148)|
| 3:22:32| We need to get some WD-40, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| Ms. Brooks, do you mind to read what the staff's recommendation was for the denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12156)|
| 3:22:44| so we all understand exactly where the staff was coming from, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12164)|
| 3:22:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| The staff recommendation, deny MDR, medium density residential sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| Approval of medium density residential uses for this site would be a spot plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12176)|
| 3:23:01| in an area surrounded by low density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12181)|
| 3:23:04| With the exception of Edgewater subdivision, at about 6 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12184)|
| 3:23:09| all of the properties in the immediate area that have access to Canton Hall Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| have a developed density of less than 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12192)|
| 3:23:16| When taken as a whole, the density in the surrounding area averages far less than 5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12196)|
| 3:23:22| which is the maximum density allowed under the LDR plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12202)|
| 3:23:26| The current LDR designation is appropriate for this property and should remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12206)|
| 3:23:30| The current sector plan proposes LDR all along Canton Hall Road from Kingston Pike south to the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12210)|
| 3:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| I'd ask my fellow commissioners to look at the packet that was presented from Mr. Jernigan to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12218)|
| 3:23:43| if you'll turn to the color photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12223)|
| 3:23:46| The color photo is provided by a contractor to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12226)|
| 3:23:50| It's CDM Smith that's doing the road layout for Canton Hall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12230)|
| 3:23:56| The nice thing on the overview color photo is you can get a real perspective of the single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12236)|
| 3:24:05| that connect driveways to Canton Hall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12245)|
| 3:24:10| The development kind of in the center is what Ms. Brooks referred to as Edgewater condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12250)|
| 3:24:17| which were developed, they had the option to develop up to 6 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12257)|
| 3:24:23| but it was not built out at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12263)|
| 3:24:26| If you'll look to the top left corner of the color photo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12266)|
| 3:24:31| you will see the mobile homes that back up to the hillside there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| and those have been there for, I don't know, I've heard 40 some odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12275)|
| 3:24:41| But as you can see, basically everything else is single family residential like the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12281)|
| 3:24:49| had built out at less than 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12289)|
| 3:24:54| There was also some members from the community that said they were going to appear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12294)|
| 3:24:59| Was there anybody here from the Canton Hall Road area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| I guess they didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| But just prior to our meeting and our discussion during the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12304)|
| 3:25:09| I did receive several emails from citizens who live off of Canton Hall Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| and asked us to not vote for medium density residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12314)|
| 3:25:21| I didn't forward them to you because I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12321)|
| 3:25:26| But anyways, I have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12326)|
| 3:25:29| So I guess I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12329)|
| 3:25:33| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12333)|
| 3:25:38| My fellow commissioners, are there other questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12338)|
| 3:25:43| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12343)|
| 3:25:45| Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| Well, the first question is, Daniel, is the reason that, I guess you were at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12346)|
| 3:25:54| the reason that the board voted in favor of the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| did they see the road improvement as a significant change in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12357)|
| 3:26:03| I really want to know why they came to that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12363)|
| 3:26:06| That's a significant vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| I was not at the MPC meeting, but it's a potential that they would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12368)|
| 3:26:13| Mr. Jernigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12373)|
| 3:26:14| The discussion, what flipped the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12374)|
| 3:26:18| There were three primary issues at the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| The MPC staff's recommendation is a purely technical recommendation on what the sector plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12382)|
| 3:26:30| New Canton Hollow Road is a major change in how all transportation is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12390)|
| 3:26:36| and how a lot of these neighborhoods are going to be able to be connected to each other with walking trails and bike trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12396)|
| 3:26:44| The other issue is the mobile home part, which, let me say, surrounds the property on two sides, is an RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12404)|
| 3:26:53| The RB zone is not a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12413)|
| 3:26:56| Tomorrow morning, you can go in there and build 335 units of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12416)|
| 3:27:04| You need no grading plan, you need no design, you need no MPC approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12424)|
| 3:27:11| What I've asked for is a transitional zone of a medium density residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12431)|
| 3:27:16| The RB is 12 units an acre, which is available tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12436)|
| 3:27:21| It surrounds the property on two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12441)|
| 3:27:24| The property on the other side, the adjoining neighbors, are in support of the rezoning to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12444)|
| 3:27:30| And as I said at the MPC meeting, in full disclosure, I am in contract negotiations to acquire these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12450)|
| 3:27:36| in which those property owners, if I am the successful person purchasing the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12456)|
| 3:27:42| their property will be zoned low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| The same as the property I did exactly on the south side of Canton Hollow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12465)|
| 3:27:50| three acres over there that I rezoned last year for a single family detached subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12470)|
| 3:27:56| The opportunity for Canton Hollow Road to be improved to where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12476)|
| 3:28:00| is the perfect opportunity in all of southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12480)|
| 3:28:04| And it's hard to say that in an area of 75,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12484)|
| 3:28:09| this 3.7 acre track is the only one that's surrounded by an RB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12489)|
| 3:28:14| and is the only one that therefore would be suitable for a transition zone to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12494)|
| 3:28:20| And it was those three, the technical requirements, the improvements of Canton Hollow Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12500)|
| 3:28:26| and the fact that this property is surrounded by an RB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12506)|
| 3:28:30| which is the reason that the commission voted overwhelmingly to support my position over the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12510)|
| 3:28:38| What are you planning to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12518)|
| 3:28:41| If this was approved, up to an acre, what would your development look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12521)|
| 3:28:46| Would it be attached condos, villas, what are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12526)|
| 3:28:50| We're looking at, I brought some photos which are in the package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12530)|
| 3:28:56| which were used at the MPC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| There's a fourplex design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12539)|
| 3:29:04| So we're looking at fourplexes, townhouses, and some small homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12544)|
| 3:29:09| We won't say tiny homes, but we're going to say some really well designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12549)|
| 3:29:13| architecturally interesting small homes in the 750 to 1,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12553)|
| 3:29:19| Especially if we can acquire one of the other properties, it would be perfect for that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12559)|
| 3:29:23| So this density allows us to have enough flexibility that we can bring some diversity of housing to southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12563)|
| 3:29:33| Not only that, this is the first time that the county is ahead of the development, which is on the roadside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12573)|
| 3:29:40| So I understand the commission's approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12580)|
| 3:29:48| and I'm having a hard time with the investment in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12588)|
| 3:29:53| Why would we not invest in a new development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| I guess that's my hardest part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| We're putting millions into the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| Why would we not want to develop it out somewhat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| And if you can put apartments right behind it, that certainly makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12603)|
| 3:30:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| Are there other questions of this presenter or these presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12609)|
| 3:30:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12615)|
| 3:30:16| I was just going to answer partially of what Commissioner Anders' question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12616)|
| 3:30:21| It is classified, Kenton Hollow Road, as the worst road in Knox County based on accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12621)|
| 3:30:27| That's why the whole reason to redo the two-mile stretch of Kenton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| We're going to spend in excess of $6.5 million to rectify that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12633)|
| 3:30:39| But also that is a key player now, that road, because it does connect to Emory Church Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12639)|
| 3:30:47| where we have multiple projects going there from assisted living facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12647)|
| 3:30:54| to a 254-unit apartment complex and some single-family home lakefront lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12654)|
| 3:31:02| So that's going to be the cut-through to get to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12662)|
| 3:31:08| And so the more development you have on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| the more people pulling out onto Kenton Hollow Road then now even increases the safety factor more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12671)|
| 3:31:19| I get that, but it's also putting curb and guttering sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12679)|
| 3:31:24| We can swap it over to Hardin Valley and we'll take it if you don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12684)|
| 3:31:28| We're improving it to the point where the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12688)|
| 3:31:31| Let me get us back on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| Do we have questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12693)|
| 3:31:37| If not, we're then moving to the, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12697)|
| 3:31:44| I'll make a motion we approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12704)|
| 3:31:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| Now then, discussion amongst commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12709)|
| 3:31:54| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12714)|
| 3:31:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12715)|
| 3:31:56| I thought MPC declined it and it was the commission whose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| MPC's commission is the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| It doesn't matter if the staff recommendation doesn't match the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12726)|
| 3:32:11| What's come out of the commission is what comes on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12731)|
| 3:32:15| But you can vote however you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| This is a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| So the staff recommendation is one and the actual commission recommendation could be something entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12740)|
| 3:32:27| Correct, it was 12-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| Because it was 12-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12749)|
| 3:32:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12750)|
| 3:32:31| Yes, I just wanted to make sure that was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12751)|
| 3:32:34| Staff said no, commission said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12756)|
| 3:32:37| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| Yeah, I'm looking at this and it's kind of a tough decision that I live by the sector plan, I die by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12760)|
| 3:32:47| The sector plan calls for it to be low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12767)|
| 3:32:50| It is agricultural at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12770)|
| 3:32:52| Jumping all the way to medium-duty residential, and I understand Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12772)|
| 3:32:58| and we've got a planning staff that are professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| I say I trust the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| I live by it in South Knoxville, the 9th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12784)|
| 3:33:07| and sometimes we get hit hard because of the sector plan, but that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12787)|
| 3:33:12| So it's kind of a tough decision to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12792)|
| 3:33:16| I'm not sure how I'll vote on this because I really think that I like following the sector plan myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12796)|
| 3:33:26| Seeing no further discussion amongst Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12806)|
| 3:33:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12812)|
| 3:33:34| When this sector plan was enacted, were plans and funding in place for Canton Hottle Road improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12814)|
| 3:33:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12820)|
| 3:33:42| Yes, they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12822)|
| 3:33:44| We just redid the Southwest sector plan, and you guys were aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12824)|
| 3:33:52| I mean, I'm sure that there's somebody with engineering who may be able to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| but the only thing that was in the plan when the South, and I attended I think all of the Southwest County sector plan hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12836)|
| 3:34:02| there was a road, Canton Hottle Road was a road project, which was one of several which was highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12842)|
| 3:34:08| but nothing was specific about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| The specificity of the program came about with the Woody Road intersection in April of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12851)|
| 3:34:18| which was supposed to be under construction last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12858)|
| 3:34:21| Knox County Engineering pulled that project back and did not do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12861)|
| 3:34:26| even though it was funded and the right-of-way had already been acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12866)|
| 3:34:31| They pulled that back to ask for enough money to redesign the entire project so that this road could be put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12871)|
| 3:34:40| which now includes on the South side the sidewalk and the bike path, and on the North side the six-foot sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12880)|
| 3:34:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12888)|
| 3:34:49| Just a moment, just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| The discussions right now are amongst commissioners, and I believe Commissioner Smith has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12892)|
| 3:35:00| When did the sector plan for the Southwest come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12900)|
| 3:35:07| When was it approved by this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12907)|
| 3:35:10| It's been within the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| We only approved budget in May, and that was the first round of funding for Canton Hottle Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12912)|
| 3:35:17| No, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| Since April of 2015, because that was about the fourth month of me being a Knox County commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12919)|
| 3:35:26| I was deeply involved in this road project, and that's when it all started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12926)|
| 3:35:30| We started with a $500,000 appropriation, then another $800,000 appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12930)|
| 3:35:36| What happened at the intersection of Canton Hottle and Woody Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12936)|
| 3:35:40| engineering said the total project to redo that intersection would be $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12940)|
| 3:35:46| We did not get a single bidder for $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12946)|
| 3:35:50| We got a bidder of $1.2 million to do that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12950)|
| 3:35:54| That's why engineering had to go back and say we're putting this whole project on hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12954)|
| 3:35:59| we'll wait to get funding for the total $6.5 million, and we will do the job all in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12959)|
| 3:36:08| So it's been going on for over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12968)|
| 3:36:13| The MPC staff, when they did their sector plan, was well aware of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12973)|
| 3:36:18| But it hasn't been funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| It's going to be funded through the next two years of our budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12980)|
| 3:36:24| I don't think you can approve major sector plan changes until funding is in place for roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12984)|
| 3:36:31| That would be getting the cart in front of the horse, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| The motion that is properly before us is to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=12995)|
| 3:36:45| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13005)|
| 3:36:49| Opposed, no. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13009)|
| 3:36:54| To the ear of the chair, we will have roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13014)|
| 3:37:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13021)|
| 3:37:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13024)|
| 3:37:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13027)|
| 3:37:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13030)|
| 3:37:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13033)|
| 3:37:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13036)|
| 3:37:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13039)|
| 3:37:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13042)|
| 3:37:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13045)|
| 3:37:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13049)|
| 3:37:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13052)|
| 3:37:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13055)|
| 3:37:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13060)|
| 3:37:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13063)|
| 3:37:46| Madam Clerk, would you please read the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| The next item is 7-G-17-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| It is also a request of Victor Jernigan for rezoning from A, Agricultural, to P.R., Planned Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13072)|
| 3:37:58| at a density up to 8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13078)|
| 3:38:01| The property is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13081)|
| 3:38:04| I recognize the applicant, Mr. Jernigan, still being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| Report of MPC, Ms. Brooks, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13088)|
| 3:38:12| MPC approves P.R., Planned Residential zoning at a density up to 8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13092)|
| 3:38:18| I'd vote a 12-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13098)|
| 3:38:22| Are there others wishing to speak to this rezoning as captioned 7-G-17-RZ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13102)|
| 3:38:32| Mr. Pace, do you wish the applicant to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13112)|
| 3:38:40| Thank you, sir. Mr. Jernigan indicated he would allow me to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13120)|
| 3:38:47| Do you want my name again for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13130)|
| 3:38:51| You recognized him, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13133)|
| 3:38:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13134)|
| 3:38:55| In light of the decision on the previous item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13135)|
| 3:39:00| I would simply ask commission, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13140)|
| 3:39:05| when this application for the actual development comes to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| that you will recall Mr. Jernigan is asking for up to 8 units per acre and not 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13150)|
| 3:39:20| which is what is allowed with medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13160)|
| 3:39:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13165)|
| 3:39:26| By definition, he cannot go to MPC asking for more than 8 because that's what we're approving tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13166)|
| 3:39:37| And his argument would be you approve medium-density and on this item it says 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13177)|
| 3:39:46| You approve the medium-density on the prior item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13186)|
| 3:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13190)|
| 3:39:51| On this item, which will be submitted to MPC as planned by the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13191)|
| 3:39:58| he cannot ask for more than 8 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13198)|
| 3:40:04| By this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13204)|
| 3:40:05| And the law director is nodding his head, so for the purpose of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13205)|
| 3:40:09| I will defer to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| Is there anyone else wishing to speak to this rezoning captioned 7G17RZ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13215)|
| 3:40:27| Seeing none, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13227)|
| 3:40:36| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13236)|
| 3:40:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13237)|
| 3:40:38| The motion that is properly before us is to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13238)|

| 3:51:46| This amends Ordinance No. 0-90-9130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13906)|
| 3:51:56| This is first reading of 0-17-8-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13916)|
| 3:52:07| Ms. Brooks, does the MPC wish to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13927)|
| 3:52:12| MPC recommends allowing the rural retreats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| The purpose is to allow events such as weddings and other events intended to take advantage of our rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13934)|
| 3:52:21| scenic rural beauty, recognizing those already in place and apply reasonable standards to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13941)|
| 3:52:27| The Commission approved it 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13947)|
| 3:52:32| Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13952)|
| 3:52:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13956)|
| 3:52:40| If you all have looked at this MPC recommendation, in the first section here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13960)|
| 3:52:46| it's putting a lot of restrictions on the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13966)|
| 3:52:51| In Item No. 11, expected number of events per year, you've got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13971)|
| 3:52:55| Expected number of attendees per event are other documents as deemed necessary by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13975)|
| 3:53:01| That's very needless of what somebody comes up and asks for a use that we're going to grant this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13981)|
| 3:53:08| and they can put other items and stipulations on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13988)|
| 3:53:12| The other thing I've got is down in Section D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13992)|
| 3:53:15| It says, well, first of all, it says the minimum of this is like 10 acres, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=13995)|
| 3:53:24| But anyway, it says setback rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14004)|
| 3:53:28| It says 2-300 feet from an adjacent property as deemed proper by MPC with a written agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14008)|
| 3:53:36| with adjacent partial owners affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14016)|
| 3:53:42| MPC may consider reducing these setbacks as part of a planned review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14022)|
| 3:53:49| 300 feet, if they don't agree to it, do you know how much that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14029)|
| 3:53:55| It's a football field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14035)|
| 3:53:58| Correct, a football field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14038)|
| 3:53:59| But just think about taking that up one side of your area, on another side of your area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14039)|
| 3:54:04| and back down if you just have 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14044)|
| 3:54:06| That's 618 feet up one side and you go in 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14046)|
| 3:54:12| You go to the top, go 600 and some feet and come down another 300 feet on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14052)|
| 3:54:19| That's a lot of property that we're going to say restricted use of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14059)|
| 3:54:24| Does that not bother anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14064)|
| 3:54:27| Now, other items on here that I've got that on Section F in this addendum here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14067)|
| 3:54:38| it says recreational use are subject to setback requirements in Section E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14078)|
| 3:54:44| And E just says rural retreats are subject to parking requirements, a theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14084)|
| 3:54:50| So which setback rules are we going to go with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14090)|
| 3:54:53| I mean, which ones can you choose from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14093)|
| 3:54:55| I'm a little puzzled by putting this kind of restrictions on somebody's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14095)|
| 3:55:06| I mean, what's the punitive issue that we're issuing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14106)|
| 3:55:09| This is a punitive action, it looks like to me, for using your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14109)|
| 3:55:14| And then the people that already owns the property that some of these uses can be done on a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14114)|
| 3:55:22| are we restricting them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14122)|
| 3:55:24| And they come up to apply for it not watching television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14124)|
| 3:55:29| I don't see anybody watching us tonight this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14129)|
| 3:55:32| But anyway, it comes up and starts to apply for it a year or so down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14132)|
| 3:55:37| And they say, oh, by the way, you can't do this and this and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14137)|
| 3:55:40| You've got to have this and all these other restrictions that are in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14140)|
| 3:55:49| And we give unelected officials power over the individual's property in this ordinance that is so much here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14149)|
| 3:56:06| And I'm just saying this applies to agricultural, R.A., R.B., E.T., A.P. and P.R. zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14166)|
| 3:56:19| This doesn't go to just one particular zoning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14179)|
| 3:56:23| So I have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14183)|
| 3:56:26| And I thought the rest of us would be having that kind of issue also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14186)|
| 3:56:32| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14192)|
| 3:56:33| Yes, Mr. Brooks, I think some of his concerns, and I get the concern, I think if you're electing to use it as an event facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14193)|
| 3:56:42| I think the setbacks goes back to Hunter Valley Farms when they had some issues out there with parking and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14202)|
| 3:56:48| I think what we're doing is if you're going to have a band venue, we're going to put you a football field away from your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14208)|
| 3:56:56| So you're choosing to open a venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14216)|
| 3:56:58| Is that some of the restrictions that NPC is considering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14218)|
| 3:57:02| Or do you know what the staff is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14222)|
| 3:57:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14225)|
| 3:57:06| If I could give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14226)|
| 3:57:07| There was a request of property owners that were interested in operating facilities, particularly in the agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14227)|
| 3:57:14| and they're currently not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14234)|
| 3:57:15| So it would require a rezoning of those ag properties to a more intense use that might not be appropriate in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14235)|
| 3:57:24| So it was an intent by staff to develop some standards that could be applied and allow people to use their property as an event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14244)|
| 3:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14253)|
| 3:57:34| So they're choosing to limit, if they do that, they're choosing to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14254)|
| 3:57:37| But what you're considering is protecting the neighbors if they choose to have an event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14257)|
| 3:57:43| Additionally, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14263)|
| 3:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14264)|
| 3:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14265)|
| 3:57:49| You still got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14269)|
| 3:57:51| He's number two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14271)|
| 3:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14272)|
| 3:57:54| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14274)|
| 3:57:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14276)|
| 3:57:58| One question I have about this, or maybe you could provide some additional clarifications or detail on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14278)|
| 3:58:04| We are, in a way, Commissioner Busler's got a point about there are some restrictions in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14284)|
| 3:58:10| but also the big picture intent is actually to free up and create some flexibility that we didn't have in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14290)|
| 3:58:17| Because as to your point, as I understand this, we did not have any zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14297)|
| 3:58:22| This almost reminds me of the Airsoft issue, you know, where we did not have any zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14302)|
| 3:58:27| or there's something that is incompatible to allow us to even grant somebody that might have had a farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14307)|
| 3:58:33| they maybe may have wanted to create an event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14313)|
| 3:58:37| So the problem that you're trying to solve is allowing someone who has a farm or rural real estate to create a business opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14317)|
| 3:58:47| by starting one of these, by having this zoning put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14327)|
| 3:58:51| By the same token, and just if you could further clarify for us and for the folks who may be watching on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14331)|
| 3:58:57| if there are any of this late, we do have preexisting businesses that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14337)|
| 3:59:03| would they be grandfathered in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| Because there are county businesses that are operating that would be in this type of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14345)|
| 3:59:11| Could you clarify what would be the status of any business that's preexisting that may be non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14351)|
| 3:59:16| that is operating one of these types of businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14363)|
| 3:59:24| It is our assumption that those can continue operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14364)|
| 3:59:28| but I cannot speak to any authority over whether or not that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14368)|
| 3:59:33| The purpose of this, like I said a minute ago, of this particular ordinance is to allow a lot of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14373)|
| 3:59:41| that are currently operating without a business license to allow them to come into conformity and to operate legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14381)|
| 3:59:49| We know that they are already out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14389)|
| 3:59:51| but with some protections against the other community members that live around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14391)|
| 3:59:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14397)|
| 3:59:58| Just for further clarification, just a second, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14398)|
| 4:00:01| We've got, it's, what you're saying is there are some that are non-compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14401)|
| 4:00:05| not necessarily new businesses that want to come into this venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14405)|
| 4:00:08| So is this an effort to get existing businesses compliant and would some of these existing businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14408)|
| 4:00:14| are they going to meet the regulations around the setbacks and all this that you all have mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14414)|
| 4:00:19| I can't speak to all of them that might be operating this type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14419)|
| 4:00:25| But, yes, that is the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14425)|
| 4:00:26| We did have a focus group that we worked with and provided these regulations to in advance to get their feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14426)|
| 4:00:35| folks in the rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14435)|
| 4:00:37| So they helped inform whether or not this would be reasonable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14437)|
| 4:00:42| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14442)|
| 4:00:46| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14446)|
| 4:00:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14447)|
| 4:00:48| My question regarding this ordinance is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14448)|
| 4:00:52| or not we looked at small, medium, and large farms because this is a very broad and blanket issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14452)|
| 4:00:59| And I think that needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| If I have a small farm, the setbacks on this would not necessarily apply to prohibit me from doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14461)|
| 4:01:08| And I was wondering if that was even considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14468)|
| 4:01:12| As in we did look at, there was a request in East Knox County of someone who only had five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14472)|
| 4:01:20| of whether or not this would apply, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| And where staff landed was that 10 acres was reasonable for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14482)|
| 4:01:28| So if it's less than 10, what then is the recommendation of the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14488)|
| 4:01:38| That in order to comply with these standards, there would have to be at least 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14498)|
| 4:01:46| Now, anything less than that would not fall under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14506)|
| 4:01:50| and probably would have to be rezoned to something different than ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14510)|
| 4:01:55| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14515)|
| 4:01:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14518)|
| 4:02:00| Amy, are you familiar with Daris Gardens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14520)|
| 4:02:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14523)|
| 4:02:04| That I believe would be less than five acres, which is a wedding facility and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14524)|
| 4:02:09| So with these regulations, they wouldn't qualify to be a wedding facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14529)|
| 4:02:15| or a reunion type facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14535)|
| 4:02:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14538)|
| 4:02:20| I'm not sure what their zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14540)|
| 4:02:22| I can't speak to what Daris Gardens is zoned at currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14542)|
| 4:02:26| I'd have to look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14546)|
| 4:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14548)|
| 4:02:29| But I would assume that they have been, they have a business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14549)|
| 4:02:33| and have been operating within the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14553)|
| 4:02:35| I'm sure they do, but they don't have 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14555)|
| 4:02:38| I don't think they would have 10 acres of property if they had to meet these new requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14558)|
| 4:02:43| I'm kind of concerned with Commissioner Bussler's about, you know, some of the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14563)|
| 4:02:48| And also, if this, when and if this is passed, it could only be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14568)|
| 4:02:56| Any of the NPC's rulings can only be appealed to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14576)|
| 4:03:00| Correct, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14580)|
| 4:03:03| Wake up, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| We're having a sidebar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14585)|
| 4:03:08| Any of these decisions, if this ordinance is passed, can only be appealed to the BZA, not the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14588)|
| 4:03:16| Certain decisions that arise under this ordinance would be appealed to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14596)|
| 4:03:19| However, BZA is not going to be able to issue a use variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14599)|
| 4:03:23| So if it's not a use that's permitted in the zone, then it wouldn't be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14603)|
| 4:03:31| And, again, if you're talking about the acreage requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14611)|
| 4:03:36| the Airsoft ordinance that you'll hear tonight, too, came before the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14616)|
| 4:03:41| and they found that there was no hardship there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14621)|
| 4:03:44| Essentially, the property owner bought the property, knowing what the regulations were, wanted to do a use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14624)|
| 4:03:51| but he didn't have enough property, so he went the other route to try to rezone or change the text of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14631)|
| 4:03:57| And that's what you'll hear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| Yeah, and that's why this 200, 300 feet setback is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14639)|
| 4:04:04| Like Mr. Bessler said, we've got to look at it closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14644)|
| 4:04:10| Is there public input on this reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14650)|
| 4:04:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14657)|
| 4:04:18| Name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14658)|
| 4:04:21| John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14661)|
| 4:04:29| I think as a preliminary, MPC staff decided for the category of an event center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14669)|
| 4:04:40| encompassing a number of different kinds of utilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14680)|
| 4:04:44| I think they made the decision to start with that it was going to have to have 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14684)|
| 4:04:54| And then the setbacks came in on that about how far you had to be away from residences and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14694)|
| 4:05:06| but left the opportunity for the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14706)|
| 4:05:13| left the opportunity for MPC to consider a lessening of those setbacks based on the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14713)|
| 4:05:24| And, you know, it may be, as it turns out, that 10 acres may be too large a category of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14724)|
| 4:05:35| But I think you can have an event center that's got a big parking lot, all sorts of features to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14735)|
| 4:05:45| outdoor entertainment facility, music, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14745)|
| 4:05:52| There are all sorts of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14752)|
| 4:05:55| And so I think the decision on staff's part was let's do a lot of that decision making as part of the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14755)|
| 4:06:05| Second as to the existing facilities that are out there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14765)|
| 4:06:11| state law says that if you have a preexisting legal use of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14771)|
| 4:06:20| and you have the adoption of or the change of zoning that would affect what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14780)|
| 4:06:29| that they are, in essence, grandfathered in and they can continue to operate the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14789)|
| 4:06:36| So they're not, you know, you've got one that's a wedding center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14796)|
| 4:06:47| and it may have facilities for being outside or inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14807)|
| 4:06:52| There's another one that would be a small wedding venue that's just inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14812)|
| 4:06:58| but small and there are all sorts of different applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14818)|
| 4:07:04| I know that a number of the staff members of MTC worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14824)|
| 4:07:10| I know they looked at some other locations that had sort of gotten into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14830)|
| 4:07:16| setting standards for these type of event centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14836)|
| 4:07:21| And this is what came out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14841)|
| 4:07:23| I'm interested because I've had a couple of people express to me that they have an interest in a particular type of event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14843)|
| 4:07:34| As it is currently stated, my clients would not have a problem with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14854)|
| 4:07:42| but you're right about if you're getting down to something very small, it presents a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14862)|
| 4:07:51| And I think, like I say, the type of event center that they have in mind dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14871)|
| 4:07:58| they just made a decision, and I can't necessarily argue with that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14878)|
| 4:08:02| that they ought to have a ten-acre site minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14882)|
| 4:08:06| because they're talking about something other than three tables of bridge and lunch type event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14886)|
| 4:08:18| They're talking about sort of larger operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14898)|
| 4:08:25| If nothing else, I'd suggest going forward with it like it is three years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14905)|
| 4:08:30| If it's presenting too big a problem for some people, less than ten-acre size, it can be fixed then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14910)|
| 4:08:43| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14923)|
| 4:08:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14925)|
| 4:08:47| Just to give you all an idea, Darryl's Garden is on 20 acres, so it would affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14927)|
| 4:08:58| Commissioner Busler, do you wish to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14938)|
| 4:09:01| Well, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14941)|
| 4:09:09| Mr. King, I want to say one thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14949)|
| 4:09:13| These restrictions on here, they have like 401.03 large-scale criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14953)|
| 4:09:21| And this other thing it says about accommodations, and then after the first 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14961)|
| 4:09:28| you have to have at least for a ratio of one for every five acres for accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14968)|
| 4:09:35| If somebody wanted to put something on there where they park a motorhome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14975)|
| 4:09:39| or a camper or something like that to be part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14979)|
| 4:09:43| the acreage that's required to put one additional one is five acres, if I read that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14983)|
| 4:09:51| And why I'm asking you this is if it does pass with all these restrictions on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14991)|
| 4:09:57| we're probably going to see you up here arguing against these restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=14997)|
| 4:10:01| saying that's what they wanted us to do, we appealed it to you, see what you can do for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15001)|
| 4:10:05| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15005)|
| 4:10:07| It won't bother me if you want to remove all those distance restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15007)|
| 4:10:13| It won't bother me, but I'm trying to reflect what I understood to be the staff's approach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15013)|
| 4:10:22| If you want to lessen those, you're not going to bother me much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15022)|
| 4:10:32| With us not, say, approving this right now, can we have time to sit down with MPC staff to say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15032)|
| 4:10:46| This is the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15046)|
| 4:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15048)|
| 4:10:49| First reading, so you're going to have a 30-day period and it will be back in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15049)|
| 4:10:53| So what I would like to do on this motion or this right here is say some of these issues that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15053)|
| 4:11:00| that we read over these things, can we sit down with the staff and see what the issues are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15060)|
| 4:11:07| And it seems like we're going to be punitive to any person that owns property with these restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15067)|
| 4:11:14| And can we work with them to see what we could get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15074)|
| 4:11:18| We will have to have a public hearing before we have a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15078)|
| 4:11:21| Commissioner Brantley, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15081)|
| 4:11:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15083)|
| 4:11:27| Some of my experience in the radio world with doing public things on property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15087)|
| 4:11:32| I cannot imagine doing an event in less than ten acres because of the neighbors, the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15092)|
| 4:11:38| If you've ever lived next to a football stadium or a high school, you know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15098)|
| 4:11:42| Even on Saturday morning, the little players, because whoever operates that microphone is going to echo for miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15102)|
| 4:11:49| And it's just insane to do anything less than ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15109)|
| 4:11:53| And I'm not sure ten is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15113)|
| 4:11:55| If there's a ban, if there's any noise at all, it's just going to be tons of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15115)|
| 4:12:02| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15122)|
| 4:12:06| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15126)|
| 4:12:07| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15127)|
| 4:12:08| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15128)|
| 4:12:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15131)|
| 4:12:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15135)|
| 4:12:16| It's just the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15136)|
| 4:12:17| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15137)|
| 4:12:20| With discussion, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15140)|
| 4:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15145)|
| 4:12:26| If we proceed from this point on, we can say before the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15146)|
| 4:12:32| can we sit down with the staff and go over these and see what we can protect the property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15152)|
| 4:12:42| You can do that individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15162)|
| 4:12:44| The members can do that individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15164)|
| 4:12:46| we will have to have a meeting with a quorum for a public hearing before second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15166)|
| 4:12:56| We have to have a public meeting that has a quorum before second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15176)|
| 4:13:04| As we've done on the other one, the last item that's on our agenda tonight, that's what we've done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15184)|
| 4:13:11| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15191)|
| 4:13:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15192)|
| 4:13:13| I guess I'm calling for a point of clarification or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15193)|
| 4:13:20| If you have some changes in these distances, the effect of which is to lessen the harm to the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15200)|
| 4:13:32| as opposed to increase the burden on the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15212)|
| 4:13:36| is that not something you can do without having to go back to a public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15216)|
| 4:13:43| We have not had a public hearing on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15223)|
| 4:13:50| We have to schedule a public hearing on this ordinance between now and its second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15230)|
| 4:13:59| I'm not following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15239)|
| 4:14:01| Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| It is a requirement under the state law and the charter that there be a 15-day notice in a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15243)|
| 4:14:08| before they adopt one of these zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15248)|
| 4:14:14| But I don't see any problem with prior to second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15254)|
| 4:14:19| NPC given an explanation or additional recommendations or insubstantial revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15259)|
| 4:14:31| To answer your point, I believe when you revise a zoning ordinance that's been recommended by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15271)|
| 4:14:42| the real focus there is whether it increases the harm to people who would oppose the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15282)|
| 4:14:50| because they have notice that an ordinance be passed as it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15290)|
| 4:14:54| but then if the county commission makes a revision to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15294)|
| 4:14:58| and it impacts those who would oppose the ordinance, that's to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15298)|
| 4:15:04| So we'll look closely at any changes that the commission wants to make and advise accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15304)|
| 4:15:10| Well, we're going to have a vote here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15310)|
| 4:15:14| It will constitute a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15314)|
| 4:15:17| Is it then your understanding that individual members of the commission can, at the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15317)|
| 4:15:26| then come with their proposal and that's what would require another notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15326)|
| 4:15:33| You know, the commission can make revisions to an ordinance up until they make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15333)|
| 4:15:41| It's a question of whether those revisions are substantial or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15341)|
| 4:15:45| That's what I'm trying to get to is that if we pass this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15345)|
| 4:15:51| and there's concern on somebody's part to a sufficient degree that they want to seek some revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15351)|
| 4:15:57| and some of these restrictions, they could come back with those at the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15357)|
| 4:16:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15363)|
| 4:16:04| And those adopted into a motion to approve without the necessity of having to go back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15364)|
| 4:16:17| I can't say blanket yes because there could be a suggested revision that would be substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15377)|
| 4:16:22| and that might change the recommendation of NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15382)|
| 4:16:25| And on the other hand, it might impact negatively those who would oppose the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15385)|
| 4:16:31| So it really has to be judged on the facts and circumstances of each revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15391)|
| 4:16:36| Like I said, purely personally and for my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15396)|
| 4:16:41| reducing those distances would not be objectionable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15401)|
| 4:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15409)|
| 4:16:50| I'm mindful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15410)|
| 4:16:52| We need to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15412)|
| 4:16:53| Excuse me, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15413)|
| 4:16:54| We need to move to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15414)|
| 4:16:56| Mr. Law Director, can't Commissioner Bussler sunshine a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15416)|
| 4:17:01| Can we discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15421)|
| 4:17:04| I think there's definitely time before the next county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15424)|
| 4:17:08| So sunshine a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15428)|
| 4:17:11| With NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15431)|
| 4:17:15| The motion that is properly before us is to approve this ordinance on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15435)|
| 4:17:21| for which we must have a mandatory public hearing before we can have second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15441)|
| 4:17:29| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15449)|
| 4:17:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15453)|
| 4:17:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15454)|
| 4:17:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15455)|
| 4:17:37| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15457)|
| 4:17:38| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15458)|
| 4:17:42| Ordinance O-17-8-102 is amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, zoning, Article II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15462)|
| 4:17:48| Section 2.20, specific terms, Article V, Section 3, I'm sorry, 5.36, T, transition zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15468)|
| 4:17:56| and Section 5.41, OB office, medical and related services zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15476)|
| 4:18:01| and added a new Article IV, Section 4.105, standards for use on review approval of supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15481)|
| 4:18:07| related to supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15487)|
| 4:18:09| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130 adopted September 10th, 1990 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15489)|
| 4:18:20| You've heard the reading of the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15500)|
| 4:18:22| Is there a comment, additional comment from NPC, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15502)|
| 4:18:27| The only comment I have is that NPC is recommending approval of the amendments related to supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15507)|
| 4:18:34| I vote it 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15514)|
| 4:18:39| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| I beat you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15521)|
| 4:18:44| Yeah, over the weekend I've had some correspondence from what do you want to give the overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15524)|
| 4:18:51| of where this came from first or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15531)|
| 4:18:57| My understanding is that this is at the request of the commission, the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15537)|
| 4:19:01| We had a zoning issue off of Ebenezer Road where a business was operating without a business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15541)|
| 4:19:11| I think, if I remember correctly, or without sprinkler systems and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15551)|
| 4:19:15| And we asked NPC to come up with an ordinance because we didn't have an ordinance in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15555)|
| 4:19:24| Since that's all happened, I've had some correspondence that maybe we should have split it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15564)|
| 4:19:32| into two different definitions, one for supportive housing and then one for recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15572)|
| 4:19:43| And the difference being supportive housing can't exclude alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15583)|
| 4:19:48| and prescription drugs from that type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15588)|
| 4:19:52| But recovery housing, you can say no alcohol, you know, no substances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15592)|
| 4:20:01| So I think some other, did some other commissioners get some correspondence as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15601)|
| 4:20:08| Just to clarify, sorry for jumping on you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15608)|
| 4:20:10| Yeah, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15610)|
| 4:20:12| Just to clarify, support, it was almost an issue of are we talking about extra support for substance abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15612)|
| 4:20:21| voluntary substance abuse treatment program versus say, to be blunt, more of a, like Finnegan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15621)|
| 4:20:27| kind of a homeless support, kind of two different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15627)|
| 4:20:31| One, if you're providing transitional living for folks who may be homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15631)|
| 4:20:36| versus substance abuse treatment type of programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15636)|
| 4:20:40| And I think this was all prompted, sorry, this was all prompted, as Commissioner Schoonmaker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15640)|
| 4:20:45| when we had a difficult time making a decision because there was not an appropriate zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15645)|
| 4:20:49| as it relates to providing recovery housing versus supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15649)|
| 4:20:55| Is that, all right, thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15655)|
| 4:20:58| And, you know, I think sometimes in Knox County we try to take a handful of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15658)|
| 4:21:07| particularly on zoning issues, and combine a whole bunch of things together where, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15667)|
| 4:21:13| instead of having, you know, 14 different ordinances, maybe we need to have 20 where we actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15673)|
| 4:21:19| moving forward, stipulate what these type housing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15679)|
| 4:21:25| So I'll defer to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15685)|
| 4:21:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15690)|
| 4:21:32| Again, I have some issues with, like, A and B in section 104.105 about the feet between the different houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15692)|
| 4:21:45| When you have a facility like this, which is on a good size property, and they need additional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15705)|
| 4:21:53| you're going to restrict the use of that land if they wanted to put another facility on there or enlarge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15713)|
| 4:22:01| It says you've got to be 1,320 feet away from that building that you built first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15721)|
| 4:22:09| And depending on how it sits on the lot, it would probably kill the rest of that facility to worry if they needed to add on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15729)|
| 4:22:17| Now, again, that's something else I want some clarity on there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15737)|
| 4:22:22| So that's one of the things I want to talk about, how you're restricting the use of that property once it's zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15742)|
| 4:22:29| And I don't want a term that comes up again that I've heard before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15749)|
| 4:22:34| We assume that this is how this is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15754)|
| 4:22:38| And we don't want to have to say, I assume this is definitely how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15758)|
| 4:22:43| So when they come up here with a project that is clearly stated that this is how this is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15763)|
| 4:22:56| and that we're not going to limit the use of that land for just that setback or this use to be on arterial highways and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15776)|
| 4:23:06| you've got to be, if you read that, you've got two sections, A and B here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15786)|
| 4:23:11| that deals with 1,320 feet of access between the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15791)|
| 4:23:17| Now, that's also punitive to the property owner, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15797)|
| 4:23:25| Now, again, if somebody can explain to me what this is about, I may change my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15805)|
| 4:23:30| But right now, there again you have another problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15810)|
| 4:23:35| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15815)|
| 4:23:37| Well, I think the attorney here is, you sent us some e-mails, correct, on this very matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15817)|
| 4:23:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15822)|
| 4:23:43| Can I recognize them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15823)|
| 4:23:44| Well, did you have concern or comment or whatever so that we'll have it all on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15824)|
| 4:23:48| Yeah, in regard to what Commissioner Schoonmaker was discussing about separating the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15828)|
| 4:23:54| usually supportive and rehab come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15834)|
| 4:23:57| I mean, there's, when you're talking about permanent supportive housing for homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15837)|
| 4:24:01| most of the time there's another factor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15841)|
| 4:24:03| It's not just they're homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15843)|
| 4:24:05| And so your treatment is a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15845)|
| 4:24:07| And so how do we, as you separate those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15847)|
| 4:24:11| are we being too careful that we're limiting ourselves to deliver services whenever you, what comes in as that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15851)|
| 4:24:21| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15861)|
| 4:24:24| I'm just trying to figure out the separation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15864)|
| 4:24:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15867)|
| 4:24:28| But I understand that there's a separation between what is allowed in those facilities regarding alcohol and drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15868)|
| 4:24:36| But, yeah, I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15876)|
| 4:24:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15879)|
| 4:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15880)|
| 4:24:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15881)|
| 4:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15882)|
| 4:24:43| Having had a round with commissioners expressing themselves, sir, could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15883)|
| 4:24:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15890)|
| 4:24:51| My name is Jared Garceau, PO Box 2425, Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15891)|
| 4:24:58| And I do represent Mandala Recovery Services, which is the facility operating out on Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15898)|
| 4:25:07| At the, I think it was the April meeting, Commission sent this back to MPC to adopt a comprehensive set of regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15907)|
| 4:25:17| for this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15917)|
| 4:25:21| I think that Mr. Archer, Jeff Archer, who drafted the proposed regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15921)|
| 4:25:27| made the definition of supportive housing purposefully inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15927)|
| 4:25:32| There are a variety of these types of facilities and how they can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15932)|
| 4:25:39| There's not a one size fits all type facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15939)|
| 4:25:43| And I would also note that the supportive housing definition under the proposed amendment doesn't take into account homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15943)|
| 4:25:51| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15951)|
| 4:25:52| The definition requires that the purpose of the facility is to house individuals with chronic health conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15952)|
| 4:26:01| including substance abuse addiction problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15961)|
| 4:26:06| So I would defer to the law director on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15966)|
| 4:26:11| But I do think if you start separating certain disabilities such as substance abuse out from other disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15971)|
| 4:26:22| other chronic health conditions, I think that you could run into an issue there under the Americans with Disabilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15982)|
| 4:26:29| But I don't think that you would need to separate between substance abuse and other chronic health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15989)|
| 4:26:39| If there's a concern that drugs and alcohol be prohibited at the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=15999)|
| 4:26:47| I think that that's something that could be a condition placed on the use by MPC during the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16007)|
| 4:27:00| Seeing no further discussion, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16020)|
| 4:27:07| Would you share your question with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16027)|
| 4:27:09| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16029)|
| 4:27:11| I may have asked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16031)|
| 4:27:13| Do we have any idea where we got the 1,300-some-odd feet, where that came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16033)|
| 4:27:19| And I'm adjusting that maybe to our friends at MPC to clarify where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16039)|
| 4:27:26| In crafting this ordinance, staff had utilized the city's use on review standards for halfway houses as an initial guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16046)|
| 4:27:38| and then looked into other communities' best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16058)|
| 4:27:41| And so that was the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16061)|
| 4:27:44| That distance is a half or a quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16064)|
| 4:27:51| That measurement is a half or a quarter mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16071)|
| 4:27:53| It's a quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| And Mr. Nystrom, after I spoke with you on the phone earlier last week, I called Mr. Archer and asked him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16075)|
| 4:28:03| He said that that distance is a quarter mile, which is a common walking distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16083)|
| 4:28:09| which they use for spacing requirements, I think, in other areas in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16089)|
| 4:28:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16094)|
| 4:28:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16096)|
| 4:28:19| And again, I'm not the expert, but it's my understanding that a recovered addict or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16099)|
| 4:28:31| an addict or a recovering addict are not a protected class under the Americans with Disability Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16111)|
| 4:28:41| I will defer to Mr. Sanders on that one, but I think that a recovering addict is absolutely a protected class of disabled individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16121)|
| 4:28:52| under the Americans with Disability Act and the Fair Housing Act and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16132)|
| 4:28:57| There will be a question to be addressed at the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16137)|
| 4:29:03| Do I hear a motion that this be approved on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16143)|
| 4:29:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16148)|
| 4:29:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16149)|
| 4:29:10| Motion is properly before us to approve on first reading, ordinance 17-8-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16150)|
| 4:29:20| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16160)|
| 4:29:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16163)|
| 4:29:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16164)|

| 4:29:29| Ordinance O-17-8-103 is amended in the Knox County Code, appendix A, zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16169)|
| 4:29:35| article 5, section 5.38, CN neighborhood commercial zone, and added in new article 4, section 4.106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16175)|
| 4:29:43| standards for the use on review approval of self-service storage facilities in the CN zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16183)|
| 4:29:52| related to self-service storage facilities in the CN neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16192)|
| 4:29:57| This amends ordinance O-90-9-130 adopted September 10th, 1990 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16197)|
| 4:30:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16210)|
| 4:30:13| Can we hear her report there real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16213)|
| 4:30:14| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16214)|
| 4:30:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16215)|
| 4:30:16| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16216)|
| 4:30:17| So MPC is recommending approval of the amendment to the Knox County zoning ordinance to the CN neighborhood commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16217)|
| 4:30:24| to identify self-storage facilities as a use permitted on review with established standards for the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16224)|
| 4:30:32| This came from a property owner in a neighborhood commercial environment close to users of those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16232)|
| 4:30:38| in order to make them more convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16238)|
| 4:30:42| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16242)|
| 4:30:43| Ms. Brooks, would they be limited in the square footage that commercial is on North Bay Road Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16243)|
| 4:30:48| or would it be larger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16248)|
| 4:30:52| It's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16252)|
| 4:30:54| It's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16254)|
| 4:30:55| Less than 5,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16255)|
| 4:30:59| Not to exceed 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16259)|
| 4:31:01| So one storage building can only be 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16261)|
| 4:31:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16266)|
| 4:31:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16267)|
| 4:31:08| I think it's the whole structure can only be 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16268)|
| 4:31:12| Individual units can be set up however you wish, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16272)|
| 4:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16276)|
| 4:31:18| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16278)|
| 4:31:19| It just seems like a small self-storage unit for an apartment complex maybe at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16279)|
| 4:31:24| I mean, I'll make a motion to approve so we can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16284)|
| 4:31:29| While we're in the motion-making business, do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16289)|
| 4:31:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16293)|
| 4:31:35| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16295)|
| 4:31:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16299)|
| 4:31:41| Yes, I was wondering, was there changes made to the type of fencing that could be put around these structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16301)|
| 4:31:47| Yes, there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16307)|
| 4:31:54| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16314)|
| 4:31:57| Excuse me, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16317)|
| 4:31:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16319)|
| 4:32:00| I've got it highlighted what the changes are on fencing and all like this if you need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16320)|
| 4:32:07| On fencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16327)|
| 4:32:11| They don't have pictures so I have to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16331)|
| 4:32:14| The structure shall be buffered from the residential zoning property with vegetation buffer with a minimum width of 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16334)|
| 4:32:26| Fifteen feet planted with a mix of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16346)|
| 4:32:32| And then it says on fencing, let's see what it says right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16352)|
| 4:32:44| Shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16364)|
| 4:32:47| We probably have before us a motion of first reading to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16367)|
| 4:32:56| A question can be answered at the public hearing preceding the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16376)|
| 4:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16386)|
| 4:33:07| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16387)|
| 4:33:09| Seeing no further discussion amongst commissioners, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16389)|
| 4:33:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16393)|

| 4:33:42| This amends Ordinance 0-90-9130 adopted September 10th, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16422)|
| 4:33:49| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16429)|
| 4:33:52| This is Ordinance 17-7-102, second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16432)|
| 4:33:57| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16437)|
| 4:34:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16440)|
| 4:34:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16441)|
| 4:34:03| Ms. Brooks, do you have any comments to be made by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16443)|
| 4:34:10| I'll just note it came to my attention that Exhibit A includes correct language that had previously been left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16450)|
| 4:34:18| So you can look at Section 49701B-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16458)|
| 4:34:22| It's highlighted in red in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16462)|
| 4:34:24| Mr. Law Director, does that give us pause for this being a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16464)|
| 4:34:31| I do not believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16471)|
| 4:34:32| It is my understanding that the language in the updated exhibit to your packet includes the language actually approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16472)|
| 4:34:40| Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16480)|
| 4:34:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16482)|
| 4:34:43| And so to approve per MPC recommendation would be to substitute Exhibit A in your packet for the exhibit that was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16483)|
| 4:34:52| attached in the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16492)|
| 4:34:55| So approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16495)|
| 4:35:01| Commissioner Daly and Anders, that amended language is okay in the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16501)|
| 4:35:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16509)|
| 4:35:15| I'm going to talk to Randy after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16515)|

| 4:35:23| Motion is properly before us to approve Ordinance 17-7-102 with amended language as used by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=16523)|

| 4:57:39| have those public hearings on that same day, September the 18th, which means we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=17859)|
| 4:57:46| back up reorganization in front of that to 2 o'clock. Two? Why? Long meeting. We can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=17866)|

| 4:58:50| Should we do the public hearing after the work session? Well, that's a novel idea. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=17930)|
