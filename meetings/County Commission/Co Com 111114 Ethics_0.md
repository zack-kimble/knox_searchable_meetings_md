| 0:00:00| And now we're going to start our public forum for public meeting for the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=0)|
| 0:00:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=14)|
| 0:00:15| It's not on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=15)|
| 0:00:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=16)|
| 0:00:17| So what we're going to do is ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=17)|
| 0:00:25| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=25)|
| 0:00:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=25)|
| 0:00:28| Based on an e-mail that I received, I'd like to know if Karen L. Smith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=28)|
| 0:00:36| Karen Smith, are you in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=36)|
| 0:00:38| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| What we're going to do is we have a list of five candidates for the commission appointment to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=42)|
| 0:00:53| So I'm just going to call you forward in alphabetical order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| Ms. Ashley Brown, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| Ashley Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| One of them said she couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| I don't know where that was heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Cindy Clabo, Ms. Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| If you'll come to the podium, give your name and address and just present yourself to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| My name is Cindy Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| I reside at 1715 Hensley Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| It's an honor to come before the commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| I enjoyed hearing the informal banter before the last meeting to see how well you all get along with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=89)|
| 0:01:37| I've applied for this vacant seat because I heard the position was available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| and I met the qualifications and it seemed a perfect fit for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| I have a passion for the fair and ethical treatment of all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| I have an interest in giving back to my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| And I have a concern that the public's confidence in our county government needs to be strengthened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| I believe that I can benefit the Knox County Ethics Committee with these attributes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| and make it a more viable, reliable, and productive branch of our county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| for the benefit of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| Does anybody have any questions for Ms. Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| Do you have any connections with any employees here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| No, Commissioner, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| Mr. Brown, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| You are retired now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Sometimes here I can think back in the last couple of three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| where we had an instance that it took more than just one meeting a month to resolve an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| And, you know, we need to have somebody that has time available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| Well, I do have the competency, the willingness, and the availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| And that's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| I'd like to serve my government in some capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| I never have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| And this is a small way to give back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| Yeah, this is going to be a question for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| And this is just a personal pet peeve of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| What's your feelings on posting stuff out of committees, out of your meetings or whatever, on social networking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=195)|
| 0:03:25| whether it be blogs, anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Well, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| If it's public information, you know, there's no way there's anything wrong with sharing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| I don't put slants on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| I'm not a drama queen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| I'm not out to cause problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| I'm here to help people and to do a good job, to do my best at whatever I'm appointed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| to work within the parameters of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| I understand that and I would honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| And, Ms. Claiborne, notice here on the resume you list a P.O. box address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I'm assuming you live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| I've lived in Knox County all my life and will live here the rest of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Where did you go to high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Any more questions for Ms. Claiborne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| Next on the list is Mr. Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Steve Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| Name and address for the record, Mr. Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Steve Drevick, 5801 Meadow Glen Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Thanks to the commission for the opportunity to present myself and apply for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| I've been involved in monitoring and looking at county politics for several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| I would enjoy the opportunity to serve my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| I think the one thing that I potentially bring to the table is in my work and my business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| I work with probably about 80 different state, county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| and local agencies all around the country, all with varying levels of ethics committee or ethics rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| purchasing rules, things of that nature that I've had to navigate over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| So I bring a particular expertise in terms of the background of what other people, what other agencies do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| what works, what doesn't work, what's reasonable to navigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| and could bring a very pragmatic approach to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| As far as other disclosures, I do have a brother-in-law that works in the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| So we don't have that much contact, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| Any questions for Mr. Drevick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Mr. Drevick, are you an attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| I noticed here that you mentioned two or three law activities, and I just wanted to confirm that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| Well, I do have to navigate quite a bit of contract law in my business, but, no, I'm not a practicing attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=365)|
| 0:06:14| Commissioner Norton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Thank you, Steve, for volunteering your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| Is there you've been pretty close to the county business here for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| And so I was just curious that are there issues now that you go way back to the more tumultuous days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=388)|
| 0:06:39| Are there issues that are still hot to you, sort of compelling you to step forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| or is this just kind of a general volunteerism that you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| More of a general volunteerism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| I think it is worthwhile to say that the commission has come a long way over the last, since, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| four years ago or so from its more tumultuous time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| It's a much more productive body, a body that, as pointed out earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| gets along well is a lot more the level of conversation that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| It's just an incredible difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| And I think in terms of specifically in the ethics committee, the drafting of the code itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| the code itself is probably one of the both stronger and more reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| and easy to navigate ones that I've seen out there in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| So I think the commission has done a very good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| and the committee has done a very good job in drafting the current guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| My only other question would be sometimes there's a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| there's a hint of political activity within the ethics committee and how the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| and we've experienced that in the past, certain people on the ethics committee could use whatever their topic is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=469)|
| 0:07:59| to beat somebody up that's in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| How would you handle that if you had a sense of that, or in your experience with ethical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| maybe there is something that can protect us from that kind of political activity within the framework of an ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| Well, I think the guidelines it has right now are fairly strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| Although some people could potentially make noise, I think the ability to use that committee, the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| the standards that it sets for a complaint, the process that it has for the handling of a complaint and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| I think kind of mitigates that somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| I mean, if anything, it probably errs more towards the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| I've heard other people call the commission a paper tiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| I don't think that that's the case either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| I think it's a well-balanced process that's in place that guards fairly well against that kind of misuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=532)|
| 0:09:01| from what I can tell from the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Commissioner Olin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Yeah, basically the same question I asked the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| The social media, which ties into what Tony was saying, is that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| some members of the ethics board have tried to make some things political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| And I believe that I don't want to see the social media being used as a committee that's not elected way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=565)|
| 0:09:37| clashing out against either this committee or any other commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| And I just want to know your views on that, of using the social media to basically voice your opinion, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| I think you bring an ex-excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| I think you bring a very excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| The ethics committee, because of potentially information that it has to be handling when it receives a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| and things like that, the handling of such a thing, the very concept of innocent until proven guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| not that the committee itself has even makes that type of decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| that information is really has to be treated very sacrosanct within the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| And it would be inappropriate to release any information other than what would be publicly available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| And I would even think for the information that would be publicly available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| it would be necessarily inappropriate for a member of the commission to use a social network to express an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| about something that is still in front of the committee and still being decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| I think that's something that any member would have to be extremely cautious about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| just because of the nature of information that they could potentially be dealing with or do deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| I think that's a very excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=649)|

| 0:11:01| Well, I hope I got that right since he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=661)|

| 0:11:06| Mr. Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=666)|
| 0:11:25| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Chuck Williams, 922 Overwood Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| I applied for this position mainly because as most of you commissioners and not all of you know, can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I've basically dedicated the last few years of my life to doing whatever I can within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| within the city to be there for people no matter what the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| From the inner city, the urban areas, all the way through Farragut and anywhere else in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| when people need me, I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And I believe strongly in a strong ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| and I believe the ethics committee sets the standards to make sure that everyone in county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| maintains certain ethics and the trust of the people of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Are you done, Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I don't know if anybody has any questions for Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| How many times do you want a 6 o'clock call in on sports time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| Once a month for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Every day at 6 o'clock you can hear him on sports time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Same question as I applied to the other ones about using the social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| Do you feel that the ethics, being on the, if you were appointed to the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| that you would use that tool to lash out, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| I think it's very unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I think it's taking advantage of your position on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| I think it violates ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| That's why you're on the committee to make sure that people maintain the ethics that people expect of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| of all county officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| And I think that you would be misusing your office and abusing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you, Chuck, for your involvement and your activity level in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| and city politics and government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| We appreciate people like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| You're very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| I was curious about the ethics committee and your interest in it specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| Is there something that you've observed on the committee or do you have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| is there another topic that you or some experience that you have that you think you could bring something that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=831)|
| 0:14:00| to the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| I was just curious about why you want to connect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| Basically, I first, while I was doing things in the community, nobody really knew me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| I was just a concerned citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| And then when we had the sunshine law and everything come to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| and they were doing the appointments, that's when I kind of got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| And I just feel that the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| and the way the commission is set up now and is run is night and day differently than what it was back four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| And I just decided that as far as the ethics committee is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| you need to voice a reason of somebody that really has no ties to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| somebody that is known at each and every one of you know my integrity level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| No one can ever say I don't have integrity, that I am a man of my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| And I'm not going to be swayed or cut deals with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| I'm going to follow the letter of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| And that's basically what made me decide that maybe I should try the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Any other questions for Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| I believe the vote comes to this on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| So we'll vote on Monday if all the people are still interested to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| Anybody else in the audience for appointment to the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| The two individuals who weren't here today, are they going to have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| if they're here next Monday, will they have an opportunity to speak at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| I believe if the commission so allows the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| if they're in the audience and they want to speak, I think the chairman would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| At his discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| All right, it's 155.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111114ethics?start=954)|
