| 2:17:50| and not do a transfer from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| That's about as clear as mud, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| It's – just know that it's neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| but what we used to do is bring all of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| the majority of wheel tax in to general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| and do an operating transfer to public libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| and we can't do that now as far as reporting goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| if we want to keep the libraries separate in our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| Commissioner Norman, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| Did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| My apologies to Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| I had intended to have MPC on here, and I didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| So I apologize, but when we have our workshop on the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| I will ask them to come, and thank you for bringing that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| because I had fully intended on having them here, and I did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| So I apologize, but we will have them here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| because I know that they have indicated to me that they do want to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| Mr. Jarrett has joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| Do you want to talk about your budget, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| I mentioned that you had sent an e-mail saying that you had been in consultation with Mr. Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| and that you felt your budget was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| Both of you had agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| That is correct, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| Thank you, and I apologize to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| I was in court until about five minutes ago arguing the Shelley breeding matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| But, yes, we believe it's a solid budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| It does assist us in continuing to provide solid legal representation without an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| In fact, there's a decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| I don't have anything relating to Joe's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| but there is another issue I want to bring up when we're done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie, you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8368)|
| 2:19:33| Similar to what Brad's plea was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8373)|
| 2:19:39| I would ask you all to spend some time over the next week or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| you know, digging into how we got to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| which is no point with the Bett Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| And I encourage you all to go and visit over the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| You know, you get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| Summit Hill changes into Dangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| It's about a mile east of the Summit Hill Central intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8403)|
| 2:20:10| Just stay on that road, and it's on your left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| Just go and have a conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| When I say have a conversation, about logistics, about budgets, about how they're spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| Just, you know, not necessarily a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| You're welcome to go on a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| But just try to, if you can, dig into a little bit about how we got to where we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| And, you know, there were several ministers here that wanted to speak to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8432)|
| 2:20:39| but, you know, this is Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| So they weren't able to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| Most of them had to prepare for their noon Bible study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| How we got to this point was, again, and I'm not going to belabor the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| I promise you I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| But, you know, they went from being a library, under the library system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8458)|
| 2:21:06| to some kind of a funky arrangement to last year getting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| $12,000 was paid, roughly two months, utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| I would just ask you all to consider last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| Last year, the big issue was this impending audit and their federal reforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8481)|
| 2:21:28| and the potential that they had misappropriated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8488)|
| 2:21:36| That was why we really didn't get to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| So we're a year removed from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| A lot of things have happened since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| So I just ask you all to, one, take another look at the audit from the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| Folks, you know, wanted the internal auditor to do it because they thought it would, one, be cost effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8509)|
| 2:21:54| and be a good audit, and it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| Take a look at that audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| It came back clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| Beck has spent the county's tax money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| But they're struggling now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| You know, this was they went from, you know, in 2008 when I came on to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8529)|
| 2:22:16| they went from a staff of three county employees, $750,000 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| and PBA support in terms of grounds and security and repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| PBA made all those budgets to today being, you know, out there with a fairly large facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8549)|
| 2:22:38| There were a couple of steps in between that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| And so I would just ask you all to dig in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8560)|
| 2:22:44| Honestly, dig in for yourself and come to a conclusion on whether you want to restore some additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8564)|
| 2:22:53| Not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| I'm not going to ask for a lot of money from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| But what I'm asking for, will ask for, is something to help that operational expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| I mean, the executive director cut his salary in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| So, you know, there's not a lot of money being spent in salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| So what we're talking about is basic subsistence, you know, in terms of utility upkeep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8589)|
| 2:23:15| and a couple of much-needed improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| So, again, I just ask you all to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| And, again, do as much work or if you have any questions of me, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| do whatever formal means we have, ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| But I just encourage you to ask Avon and the folks over there at BEG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8612)|
| 2:23:36| So that's really all I wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| Again, I just want you to answer the question for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| And if at the end of the day you come back and say, okay, no, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| But please do due diligence and ask those tough questions that I'm sure you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8627)|
| 2:23:54| And I'm convinced that you'll be moved by the work that's being done over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8634)|
| 2:24:01| Mr. Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| Did anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| I see none, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| As you all know, when I came on commission back in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| I started looking into senior issues in Knox County because we have moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8658)|
| 2:24:26| into what's being called the silver tsunami,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| where we have so many of our citizens that are turning 65 and older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| And that age group is growing by leaps and bounds every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8677)|
| 2:24:44| And if communities aren't ready, they're going to be faced with a very overwhelming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8684)|
| 2:24:52| and daunting task of trying to keep up with needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| And as I've worked with different groups and attended seminars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| and talked with other people working on senior issues around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| what I've discovered is that the number one issue of concern to senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8709)|
| 2:25:16| and the number to the majority of senior citizens, and this is more than you hear this more often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| concerns about Social Security or concerns about prescription drug costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8723)|
| 2:25:31| And also what I hear from talking to people who work with seniors here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| is that transportation is the number one issue that seniors worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| And when you think about how many different things that transportation impacts for a senior citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8741)|
| 2:25:48| sometimes going to the grocery store or going to the doctor or going to the pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8748)|
| 2:25:53| but just being able to get out and go to church, to go to family gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8753)|
| 2:25:59| We have a lot of senior couples in our community where one member or the wife or the husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8759)|
| 2:26:07| is in assisted living or a nursing home, but the spouse is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| We have spouses who have a deceased spouse who would like to be able to go to the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| And transportation is just not available for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| A lot of our seniors continue to drive after the time they should be driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| because they are afraid of losing their independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| and not being able to get transportation to the places that they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| And this endangers them, and it also endangers other people who are on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8794)|
| 2:26:41| I put together some facts, and I'm not going to go through the whole list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| You can do that at your leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| But the average senior will outlive their ability to drive by seven to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| That's a pretty significant chunk of somebody's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| that they're going to be dependent on someone else for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| A lot of us don't have, or a lot of our seniors don't have family members who can take them places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8820)|
| 2:27:08| or they have children who could do that, but they have to work, or they have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8828)|
| 2:27:14| And a lot of us find ourselves in that sandwich generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| where we have aging parents and younger children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| This also goes further in terms of seniors in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8844)|
| 2:27:31| There's been volumes and volumes of research done on that seniors stay healthier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| live longer, and are happier if they have outlets into the community, if they stay active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8857)|
| 2:27:45| When seniors don't have access to transportation, they become isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| They stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| They end up going into nursing homes or assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| It ends up just from the ‑‑ for me, this is not just an issue about how we treat our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8875)|
| 2:28:02| It's also a big financial issue for those of us who are in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| because we end up picking up the cost of a lot of these costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| We'll end up paying those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| So I think if we invest a little bit of money in senior transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| it's like what we're doing with the flu vaccine and those types of programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| that a little bit of money invested goes a long, long way to alleviating more expenses down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8905)|
| 2:28:35| You all know this is a big issue for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| It's something I talk about year‑round, senior transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| What CAT used to provide to our seniors was not just transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8921)|
| 2:28:47| It was also independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| That is something that we desperately need to reinstate in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| is funding for senior transportation on CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| But I think we also need to go further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| Knox County, Knoxville, Knox County CAC, Office on Aging, provides a tremendous service for our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8940)|
| 2:29:08| You can call and say, I need to ‑‑ I have a doctor's appointment or I need to do this or that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| and they will try to find some way to provide that transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| Unfortunately, the need is much, much greater than what they're able to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8959)|
| 2:29:26| And what's happening now is that I don't think any senior should have to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| and convince someone that their need is greater, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8972)|
| 2:29:38| I have to have a ride because I have stroke therapy or I have to have a ride because I have dialysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8978)|
| 2:29:45| Because then we have seniors who feel like their needs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| no one wants to have to call and beg for a ride to go visit their spouse at the nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| But that's what's happening right now because we aren't funding senior transportation adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=8994)|
| 2:30:00| We also have seniors that right now rides are triaged in terms of medical need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9000)|
| 2:30:06| Dialysis patients get top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| We are having to tell people, people who have had strokes and return home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| and their physical therapist or their doctor says, you may not be able to use that arm right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9014)|
| 2:30:20| but if you come to stroke therapy three times a week for the next couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| we can probably help you regain the use of that arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| That can mean the difference from them of being able to remain in their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| or have to go into a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| But they don't have transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| They can't go make use of that or take advantage of that therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9037)|
| 2:30:42| It's the same with we have patients who call who need to go in for cardiac therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| and CAC can't provide that transportation for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9047)|
| 2:30:51| So they miss out on the benefits that they would get from cardiac therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| So I think this is the most important issue we've got going forward with our senior population in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9055)|
| 2:31:02| It's the single most important thing we can do to both save money in the long run for Knox County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9062)|
| 2:31:09| and to also provide our seniors with what the single most important thing they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| to be able to stay in their homes and not have to go into a nursing home sooner than they would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9074)|
| 2:31:21| So I hope that as we move forward, you all will work with me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| on trying to get some additional funding for senior transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| Eventually, hopefully we're all going to live long enough that this is going to be an issue for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9091)|
| 2:31:38| And at the important time to make these plans is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| not when we've got a huge greater number of seniors and we don't know where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9102)|
| 2:31:49| We can start now and alleviate a lot of the pressure that's coming down the road for the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| So if we are looking at, you know, property tax increase, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| a one cent for seniors property tax increase would generate a million dollars in revenue right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9120)|
| 2:32:07| that could be used to fund senior transportation on CAD and also be able to offer CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9127)|
| 2:32:15| through their transportation programs could offer a all you have to do is pick up the phone and call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| and your transportation is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| You don't have to make a case for where you need to go or why you need to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| If you want to go to church on Sunday, we'll provide that transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| If you want to go visit your spouse or you want to go visit the cemetery or you want to go to the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9151)|
| 2:32:38| or wherever it is that you need to go, all you have to do is pick up the phone and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| You don't have to beg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| You don't have to explain why your need is so much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| This would do more for our senior citizens in Knox County than anything else that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| So I look forward to talking with each of you more in depth on this in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| And I hope that you will work with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| And I am open to any suggestions and ideas that anyone else has when we talk about senior transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9182)|
| 2:33:09| I think it's something very, very important for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9193)|
| 2:33:14| Quick question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| What's your intentions on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| Say things like this and what Brad's come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| Some others have some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| Are we going to vote on individual as a block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| What do you plan to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| Well, when we have the budget meeting and we're tentatively scheduled for the 30th to vote just on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9204)|
| 2:33:31| that's when these items will come up and they'll be voted on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| And, of course, there needs to be a funding source for it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| So I'm sure it will be a lively discussion, which brings me up to our next workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9217)|
| 2:33:44| We have a workshop on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| A number of people want to talk about the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| A number of people want to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| That would be an opportunity to do that after we have our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9232)|
| 2:33:55| Jolie, I understand that the agenda is fairly light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| It's pretty light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| So we could have a public hearing or have folks address us after the agenda on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9240)|
| 2:34:07| We're also having our regular meeting on the Tuesday, the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| So we could conceivably set some time there to have some public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9253)|
| 2:34:18| And then we're tentatively scheduled to have the meeting on Tuesday to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| And that's a 5 o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| I'm suggesting that we try to have public comment before the Tuesday meeting on the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9265)|
| 2:34:32| Because if we do that, then I think everyone will have an opportunity to address us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9272)|
| 2:34:37| give us their thoughts and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| Because on the 30th, I'm expecting a lot of debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| and discussion among commissioners about where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| So I'm just throwing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| We can also do public forum that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| But my sense is that if we do that, we're going to be spending a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| And I think by the 30th, we'll probably all kind of have a good feel for what we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| and how we want to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| But I just throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| And we are also meeting now with the schools and the school board on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| And that's at Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| The agenda for that hasn't been set yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| But my view on that is that we're really going to hunker down and get into numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| We've heard a lot about programs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| I would really like to get in and talk numbers with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9321)|
| 2:35:22| Our meeting on the 29th is a Tuesday because of the Labor Day holiday or Memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9322)|
| 2:35:27| And then the Wednesday is the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| So it's Tuesday and Wednesday that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| It will be Tuesday and Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| But Tuesday is just non-budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| But we could have a public forum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| And then on the Wednesday is when we are set to tentatively vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| So, Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| I just wanted to say that the Food Policy Council is on the agenda, is making a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| And we're going to punt that until later on in the interest of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| so that we can focus exclusively on budget matters that day in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| So, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9360)|
| 2:36:01| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| When we meet with the school board, is finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| Are they going to be there with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9365)|
| 2:36:06| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9366)|
| 2:36:07| We're going to crunch numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9367)|
| 2:36:08| I want them to back us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| I'll make sure that Chris is fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| We'll make sure that you're taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| How does that sound to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| Having a public forum on our workshop after we get through with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| Is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Okay, we'll notice that and people can address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| We'll also set time on the meeting on that Tuesday for some public comment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9387)|
| 2:36:33| And then we'll look at Wednesday, the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9393)|
| 2:36:37| Okay, any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120516?start=9399)|
