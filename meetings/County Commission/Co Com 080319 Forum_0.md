| 0:00:00| Let me welcome you to this forum of the 2nd County Commission District. My name is Mark Harmon, and I'm the commissioner from the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| And I can keep going until the volume comes down in the rest of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=10)|
| 0:00:14| Corey is here to record from CTV, community television, and I think we're all going to do fine as long as we project from this spot so we can all hear one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=14)|
| 0:00:26| The format, and I encourage any presenters or speakers to be loud and clear, and to not venture too far from the cone of sound into the cone of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=26)|
| 0:00:38| So many people here to recognize. Let me start. I believe I saw our County Law Director, John Owings, welcoming people over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=38)|
| 0:00:46| I saw Sheriff J.J. Jones back there. Commissioners, several. Commissioner Roundtree is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=46)|
| 0:00:54| I saw Commissioner Briggs. Commissioner Smith, I saw somewhere. There he is. Commissioner Moore. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=54)|
| 0:01:04| Who have I left out? I'm going to get myself in trouble. Commissioner Lambert, lest we forget. And Commissioner Mark Tampin are also here in the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=64)|
| 0:01:14| Strickland is here. We've got more. Okay. And Commissioner Pinkston is here as well. Have I left out? And Hank Strickland is here, the Commission Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=74)|
| 0:01:25| Now have I left out? Okay. City Councilman Bob Becker. Commissioner Wright, I recognized earlier. How are we doing here on the recognition of folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=85)|
| 0:01:35| Oh, and Congressman Candidate Amy Broyles. All right. So that all said, the format this evening is going to be relatively simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=95)|
| 0:01:46| Three of the folks from the Knox County Petition Group, at least two of the folks from the Knox County Petition Group, are here to give a briefing on where things stand now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=106)|
| 0:01:58| with the petition movement and what are contained within the various charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| After that, we will open up to a question and answer period, and I will close with a survey here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=125)|
| 0:02:13| I'm going to ask you to fill out an anonymous survey regarding both the charter amendments and this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| So I think what I'll do is while they are giving a presentation about what is that? Commissioner Davis just walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| While they are doing that, I'll quietly distribute the questionnaire. Please wait until the end of the forum. You may have changed your mind as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=148)|
| 0:02:38| Any questions at all about the process of how we will do this rather simple and I hope effective forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| Was there a sign-in sheet you needed to be assigned somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| There was no sign-in sheet. Not to worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| That said, let us proceed directly to a presentation about Knox charter petitions and where things stand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=172)|
| 0:03:02| Do either of you gentlemen want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Okay. Introduce yourself and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Good evening. My name is Brad Hill. I live in the 7th District, roots in South Knoxville, and we still have property in North Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=189)|
| 0:03:22| So actually, as far as this district is concerned, I'm still a taxpayer over here, and gladly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| The Knoxcharterpetition.com group, this year, is an extension of last year's effort with Knox County One Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=209)|
| 0:03:40| At our other forums, we have gone through the specific timeline of last May's five meetings, the various locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=220)|
| 0:03:51| and gone through this ad nauseum to where, through the television, the newspaper, and other forums that I see some of you that have attended other forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=231)|
| 0:04:01| I really don't want to take up valuable time going through that timeline with the exception of specific questions about anything to do with last year or this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=241)|
| 0:04:12| But the Knox Charter Petition Group is an extension of last year's effort to take what we recommended in September and bring it to the people of Provost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=252)|
| 0:04:22| So that's about as brief as I can be about that. I would love to take questions about last year, this year, or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| But more than anything, I would love to focus on the amendments themselves, the concerns you have, the things you like, and the things you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=270)|
| 0:04:39| And so that's my opening statement, and it's as brief as I can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Hey, I'm Tom Jensen, and I live over on, my wife and I, Carol, live over on Snowden Drive, and we vote at the 38th Precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=284)|
| 0:05:11| We're delighted to be here and to be on one of the lists of people involved in this volunteer effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| I think Brad covered how we got started and how we got to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| You're going to be asking us some questions, I hope, in a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| Most of you have, I'm sure, already seen a list of these nine issues that were put together and offered to the Commission first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=332)|
| 0:05:45| And the Commission took that list and adopted a number of them on first reading and left a couple of them not adopted on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=345)|
| 0:05:56| And in the interim period, some very interesting developments occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| And one of those developments was that a decision was reached by the Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Commission to seek a Charter Amendment Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=362)|
| 0:06:20| And that Commission has been agreed to by the county mayor, and it's my understanding that people are being asked to serve on that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=380)|
| 0:06:33| And that body will have at least nine commissioners on it, and it will have at least ten citizens that are not members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=393)|
| 0:06:47| And that group then will go and take whatever they choose to take and make determinations as to amendments that they would bring back to the Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=407)|
| 0:07:02| Now, there's been some concern that we had too much going on in too short a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| so it was very important for us to be able to shove this thing off, if possible, to the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| And I understand now that there's some question as to whether or not that's possible to do that, but hopefully we'll get that resolved in the near future, and we'll know whether that can happen or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=438)|
| 0:07:32| The advantage of pushing it off to the November ballot is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| One is that'll be the biggest vote in the year, and so it gives more citizens an opportunity to vote on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| And the second thing is it gives more time for consideration of the things that the public is being asked to do and citizens are being asked to look at and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=464)|
| 0:07:57| And so I think everybody has seen these issues, and so I'm not sure that the amendments, I'm not sure we need to read them to you or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=477)|
| 0:08:11| but I'll read the captions to you and then we can determine if we need additional discussion about any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| The first one is that I want to point out is the consistency amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| And the consistency amendment has been withdrawn, so it's no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| And the reason it was withdrawn, basically, was some concern about whether we needed something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| And the fact is that it's not certain that it really does anything because the operation of law would say that whatever is passed would replace what it was passed to replace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=517)|
| 0:08:56| and so there might be, at some point, some kind of a question that would be raised between things that are passed and things that are already in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=536)|
| 0:09:05| But it's not an issue that's worth a lot of debate, and so we've agreed that we ought to just pull it out and not deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=545)|
| 0:09:15| The next one is the commission slash employment amendment, and this is an amendment that provides that Knox County government employees should not serve or could not serve on the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=555)|
| 0:09:33| Then we have one on the referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| There's concern that we were proposing bringing a referendum, if necessary, by getting petitions signed in order to get it on the ballot as a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=577)|
| 0:09:49| The law got changed a while back when nobody really seemed to realize it was being changed to require 15% of the registered voters in Knox County instead of 15% of the referendum of those that voted in the previous election, the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=589)|
| 0:10:13| The problem with that, of course, is that it requires a lot more petitions to be gathered, and the only reason someone would support not using the number that's always been used in the past if this was changed was to make it harder for the citizens to have an opportunity to bring up an initiative on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=613)|
| 0:10:36| And so we're hopeful that that will get returned to where it was previously and require 15% of ballots cast in the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| Which would not impact us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| No, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| As Brad points out, it would not impact this matter at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| It's for the future that we were considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Nepotism amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| I think you all are aware of what a nepotism amendment does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| It prohibits the employment of relatives in various government, in county government policy, hiring policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=666)|
| 0:11:17| And it's important for us to consider that, we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Then there's an amendment on creating the office of inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| And this office of inspector general would be an office that hopefully would be very free of any pressure brought to the general by either elected members of the government or by citizens or business interests or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=689)|
| 0:11:51| And so the effort is to make that office one that would be pretty much freestanding and would operate for a long enough term that hopefully it would overlap whatever other offices, elected offices there might be that inspector general would like to perhaps outlast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=711)|
| 0:12:14| So anyway, you can read the information or we can give you all the information about it if you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| The next one is restructuring of the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| And this particular amendment is one of those couple of amendments that there's a lot of controversy about and frankly a lot of disagreement about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=744)|
| 0:12:35| Some people think that's a great idea and there are other people that think it's a lousy idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| But the idea of having the elected county executive, county mayor, choose a cabinet and present the cabinet for approval to the county commission and let the county commission then decide whether or not to approve those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=761)|
| 0:13:05| puts both the executive office and the legislative office of our county government in charge of making those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=785)|
| 0:13:16| The advantage of making those appointments primarily is to have the county work as a unit rather than several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=796)|
| 0:13:25| The way we operate in our county and the way any county operates that has the form of government that we have here is we have a lot of little businesses in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=805)|
| 0:13:36| One is involved in registering deeds and another is involved in collecting taxes and another is involved in some other matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=816)|
| 0:13:50| And the idea is to put those units together and have one county organization that's in charge of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=830)|
| 0:13:59| And the way you do that of course is to have an elected county official that is the chief executive officer of the county that deals with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=839)|
| 0:14:11| I served not too long ago on the thing appointed by the commission actually, the Knox County Citizens Committee on Efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=851)|
| 0:14:22| And we went through and talked to most all of the fee offices and we talked a lot to the mayor's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=862)|
| 0:14:32| And one of the things that was pretty obvious was that a lot of the things that might be efficient and good to do had a difficult time getting it done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| because you would have some fee offices would say, oh, I don't really need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| And there was no one to tell them that they ought to do that, whether it was good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| It's just every unit operated on its own schedule and its own method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| Now I would have to say that a lot has been done in the employment practices of the county and in several areas to unify a lot of these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=899)|
| 0:15:10| But we could do it a lot better if we just organized more like an efficient one organization rather than a lot of little organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=910)|
| 0:15:20| So that's what that issue is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Now there are obviously very strong feelings about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| There are some folks that just say that is completely not what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| We want to keep what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| We want to keep the government like it's been for 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Well, I have to tell you that the government is not like it has been for 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| There have been a lot of changes made in the way our government operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| There have been a lot of changes that have been made to eliminate some things in government that we used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| We used to have a county ranger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| We used to have constables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| We used to have a lot of kinds of things in government that we found we didn't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| And so we did away with some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| There are a lot of operations within the county that are much more businesslike, obviously, today than they were back when we got on our horse and rode to the county seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=963)|
| 0:16:15| and recorded our deed and got back home before it got dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| That was the size of our counties in the state that was chosen because the criteria was that everybody ought to be in a location where they could get to the courthouse and back before dark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=980)|
| 0:16:32| in order to do their business at the county seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| So we've got 99 counties, and some would argue that we'd be better off with less than 99 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| I wouldn't argue that because that would raise another issue, and we don't make any more issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| But there are things that over time we do manage to get changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| And one of the things that we could change at this time would be this issue involving the executive branch of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| But let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| The next item is the restructuring of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| Now this is another item that there's not universal support for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| I have to tell you that it is a very controversial idea and recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| And the recommendation that we've offered is to reduce the size of the legislative body of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1036)|
| 0:17:28| The idea being that maybe if it was a little bit smaller, it would be easier for it to work together and resolve issues and do the business that it has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1048)|
| 0:17:40| And this has been kind of a national effort with all kinds of organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1060)|
| 0:17:49| State legislatures have many places, as they've had a chance to reorganize, have cut the size of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1069)|
| 0:17:58| City councils have reduced the size of city councils in a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| County governments have done the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| And so the goal of this group that's been working on this is to try to bring a more workable size to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1086)|
| 0:18:16| Now I know that county commissioners say that they've got plenty to do where they are and they really don't want to cut the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| They'd like to have more if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Well, that is an issue that needs a lot of debate and a lot of study to reach a conclusion that would be agreeable to by a majority of our voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1106)|
| 0:18:39| And so what my view is about these, especially these very controversial issues, is to pass them on to the charter committee and let the charter committee take up and discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1119)|
| 0:18:56| look at the things we've done, look at the things that might be recommended by members of the commission, and take up the issues that any of you may have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1136)|
| 0:19:05| But this is the position that we have brought forward as the one that we think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| We have an issue, I mean, an amendment on the conflict of interest for the legislature and a conflict of interest for the administrative offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1150)|
| 0:19:23| And that includes the list of proposed amendments that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| And so unless you have some specific question about one of these issues, we'll just go into the question and answer period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| Well, I want to thank these two gentlemen for giving us a little background and explaining where we are right now with the charter amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1179)|
| 0:19:59| Some of you have been following this quite closely. Others, this may be relatively new to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| There were originally nine. As you suggested, the one dealing with sort of making compatible has been dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1204)|
| 0:20:14| So you have here on this blue form actually the eight plus some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| And I hope you will fill it out at the end of the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| I also want to recognize Commissioner DeFries, Victoria DeFries, who has arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| And we appreciate her being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Why don't we go directly to a question and answer session for either our presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Or if you have a question that you need to direct to someone else who is here, feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| Let's start with this gentleman in this little jacket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you, Commissioner. Tom Jensen, my dear friend forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| I can't. It's not the first time you're going to say, well, maybe this is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1247)|
| 0:20:57| Anyway, I can't believe that you held a partisan office for many, many years in the state legislature and then came up with a nonpartisan suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1257)|
| 0:21:07| Maybe you don't feel like maybe this is just the committee that's putting this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| But I cannot see a nonpartisan election in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| You lose your power. People lose their power to have the check and balance that they ought to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| How do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Well, the way I feel about it, Mr. Carroll, my good friend, is that this committee has chosen to remove that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| And I certainly feel that way myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| OK, let me ask you another question. I won't take up too much time. You got your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| You speak more than I do. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| You speak better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| The next thing I want to say, Tom, is I don't understand the committee putting forth a proposal to appoint these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1307)|
| 0:21:57| Right now, the people can vote, people in and out, but they won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| And so now we make a proposal to appoint offices and create another position, which is going to cost $150,000 to $200,000 more a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1322)|
| 0:22:12| So in my mind, I think the worst mistake we ever made was starting appointing the school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| And now we're going to start appointing or trying to appoint some of these people that will be representing the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| and I think voters need to have an opportunity to speak to those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| We won't have any say-so at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Now, how do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Go ahead and answer, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Let me ask you a question in response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Would you like for the city of Knoxville to take all the department heads and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| we're going to not have them be appointed by the city government anymore, but we're going to have them elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| It wouldn't bother me a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| I think the more elections that you have, the more freedom that you have, the more input you have in the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| It wouldn't bother me a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Well, can I jump in the fire there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| You know, taking away the vote is obviously a theme and a valid one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1386)|
| 0:23:15| and I don't belittle anyone at all who doesn't want their vote taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| But the way I see this, and I'm sure a lot of you will totally disagree with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| the way I see it is that it's a small number, relatively speaking to two-thirds of a billion dollars in the annual budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1405)|
| 0:23:33| but $9 million right now, 8.9 in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| It'll probably be 9 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| It'll be 10 soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Millions of dollars in these fee offices are not under the supervision of county commission budgetary control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1422)|
| 0:23:52| They're not under the supervision of a county executive, a now county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| For me, it's more of an issue of efficiency than it is taking away the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1438)|
| 0:24:07| and I know I will not convince people with that argument necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| But as far as in my opinion, in my opinion, we can certainly respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| I see this as bringing these offices under better supervision and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| When I understand we have 53 or 55 people in any particular fee office in Nashville and Memphis County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| which are much larger, have far fewer people, it's a sign to me that maybe those budgets might be possibly a little bit out of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1475)|
| 0:24:44| and that they might not be the most efficient forms of use of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| That's how I see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| It's not so much taking away the vote as the mayor recommending qualified folks after going through a vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| It's not about cronyism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| If county commission is asleep on the job and allows a crony through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| and not a qualified applicant who's been vetted through human resources, that's their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| But the fact that they also have the ability, and I can't say this enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| county commission has the ability to fire anyone that's appointed by them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| recommended by the mayor, approved by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| They have the right to fire with a super majority, two-thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| and Cynthia Finch would have been gone last summer and maybe others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Chief of staff might have even been gone last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| And so what I'm saying, and not that I'm picking on the administration necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| but the fact of the matter is it's checks and balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| and this is one that's a checks and balances issue for me that, yet again, respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| I disagree that it's taking away a vote as much as it is checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| It's taking away checks and balances, Brent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| When you cannot vote for people, when you cannot choose people county-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| then you're letting one mayor, 15 mayors, 19 mayors, county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| But you're voting for the very people who are responsible for them tipping off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| I'm going to recognize people to speak in sort of the order that I saw the hand go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| The second hand I saw go up was the lottery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Please, I have a few questions, actually, and mine really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| First of all, let me respond to something that Brad said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Brad, you said that the fee offices are not under the supervision of the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| and while that's true, the mayor does approve of the salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| The mayor does approve of the salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| If the mayor doesn't approve of the salary suit, then it's litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| So the mayor does have some oversight responsibility of who's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| So the mayor has a choice between approving and sending something to a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| Well, it's already a lawsuit, but it's whether you wish to contest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Why don't you take the lead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| I want to hear the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Keep the brief open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Let me just ask the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Under our charter, the Charter Review Committee, once it is appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| it must finish its work between 45 and 60 days prior to the next general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| next following their appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| And so if this Charter Review Committee is set in motion this Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| it must complete its work 45 days prior to August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| And the issues then would be on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| You could also have a Charter Review Committee for the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| but it would have to be set in motion, in my opinion, after the August 7th election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| Then they would have five weeks to work on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| because they would have to have their work completed by mid-September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Right now you have virtually a 90-day window per the chart, beginning Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| John, that doesn't sound right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| It seems to me you could set up something now with a November deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Read the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Read that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| And it's very, very, very, very plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| It says, once it's set in motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| that they must present their amendments to the Election Commission between 45 and 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1704)|
| 0:28:32| prior to the next general election, next following their appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| Now, that's August 7th by anybody's standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Present its recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| It's not saying necessarily put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| It says, shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Counsel, can I ask you one simple question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Does the Charter specify a county general versus a national general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| The next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| The next general election by anybody's standard is August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| We don't run the county necessarily by the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I've got one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| One more question about the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| And this, I guess, Gary Brennan's here, Brad, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| If the mayor initiates a new Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| subject to the ratification of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| we're looking at 90 days, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| It's probably enough time to do some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| It's probably enough time to address the nine amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| And I guess now we're down to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| It may not be enough time to do the once every eight year review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| in the review of the Charter to propose amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| I just don't know that that's enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| So I assume that it's acceptable to the petitioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| to have the eight amendments addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| and perhaps anything else that's directly related to those amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| I think absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| The eight that are in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| we want to make sure there are no long-term negatives for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| legal or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| And given, of course, it's a new process as far as, yet again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| going into open meetings and being able to take those eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| and make sure they're vetted to everyone's liking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| just to get them hopefully, in my personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| to a vote of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| The next hand I saw up was Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| so I wanted to ask her a brief question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Have I ever had a brief question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| I was hoping tonight might be a brief question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| I'm coming for it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| I don't think you're going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| One of my questions is, and I really appreciate that you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| are starting to be flexible with these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| but here's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| When you first came forward, you said this was an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| that these were the citizens' ideas and that they couldn't be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| And now you're showing some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| which tells me that these might not necessarily be the citizens' ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| They may be your ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Because if they're your ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| then you can have some flexibility with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I can compromise with my ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| But if I'm bringing forward the ideas of 600 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| which actually now we find out after we scrub the list a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| and take out duplicate names of folks that attended multiple forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| is well under 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| If I'm representing those 190-some-odd people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| I don't have the authority to change my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| Only those people have the authority to change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| And while I appreciate you all being flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| I wish you would just be a little more honest with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| that you are a group of folks that have gotten together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| and come up with some great ideas for us to debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| for us to vote on, for us to alter through the amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| You all have brought us some good legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| But it's come from a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| It has not come from the citizens in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| It has come from a small group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| And again, I appreciate the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| But what I don't appreciate is that you try to make it look like this is the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| that this is a grassroots movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I don't see this as a grassroots movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I see this as some folks that are interested in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| have gotten together and maybe used the public to kind of get some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| But it's a group of people just like any other group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| a relatively small group from the way I see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| that has brought us some things to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| And I just wish you would quit pretending like it was all in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| and that this was the people's process rather than your group's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| And now my question is why you have the idea of the mayor will appoint all these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1989)|
| 0:33:19| Why did you pull out the tax assessor from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| Because I'll tell you, from where I'm standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| it looks like you pulled the tax assessor out of the mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| because you were worried about getting Phil Ballard's vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| and to appease certain folks that support Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Now that's what it looks like to me because here we have a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| that's running for tax assessor and then all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| oh, we're taking that off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| Why not take all of these off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Why not say, you know what, we're going to let folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| we think it's good for folks to continue to elect these offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| because if it's a good idea for folks to elect their sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| and I certainly think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I can't wait to cast my vote for J.J. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| And if it's a good idea to cast their vote for a tax assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| and again, as a Republican, can't wait to vote for my fellow Republican Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| But if it's a good idea to vote for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| why don't we continue to vote for the rest of the offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Why just pick out the ones that have a sitting commissioner running for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| Why just pick those out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| And that's as brief as it gets for me, Mr. Connery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| I know it really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| I can't tell you how much I really look forward to voting for Andrew Tyree when he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| But I believe I saw Scott Boyd's hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| Do you still have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Yeah, I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I saw Bob's and then I saw yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| John answered most of it and discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| The issue I have, if the mayor puts a specific eight questions for this charter commission to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2098)|
| 0:35:07| they have 91 days starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| If it happens Monday, that gives them 46 days to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| That would give them 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| No, they've got 91 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| 91 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| And then you've got the 45-day threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| The problem I would have with that is what if there are other amendments that citizens of Knox County would want to debate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| And if it's sent down in the order from the mayor, then it would be out of the question to take anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| If you say go from A to Z, talk about anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| you're going to have more people coming at this charter commission wanting things changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| and you're going to have just a ballot that's going to look like a novel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| And you're not going to have time to really dive into the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| That's my two problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Can we ask a question here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Would you want a charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I'm trying to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Well, I mean, what's your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| I mean, if the mayor says, okay, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| I'll send the order down that we're going to create a charter commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| and we're going to look at these eight things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| You're asking me what I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| I've never served on such a committee before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| and I'm assuming this will be an esteemed group of folks, nine representatives from commission and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| I don't know what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I don't know what the charge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| I'm open to whatever this committee is charged to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| I'm not responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| So I will be a pawn in the mix, I guess, and I'm happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| I guess I'm not making myself plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| If the charge is this committee, that charter review commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| is charged to see if the eight amendments should be put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| It's at least that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Well, no, it's not at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| If the mayor says it's eight, it's eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| You can't go and say, somebody come in and say, you know, I really think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| I want a taxpayer to do a right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Well, I'm tempted to tell you we have eight remaining charter amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| and I will be happy to suggest that we examine all eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| If the charge was four, if the charge was six, my hands will be tied, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| I won't have any choice but to accept whatever the charge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| But if it's open-ended for public input for additional amendments, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| That will open the process in a wonderful way where people can come up with all kinds of ideas for deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| But 90 days might be kind of tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| I've never done that before, so if I'm chosen, I'm telling you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| it would be an honor to serve, and we'll see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| Okay, but hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| I'm still going to get my question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| I heard an answer, but keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| If you're charged with eight, Commissioner Harmon, and that comes from this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| there's many more people out here talking about taxpayer-built rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| that you can't raise taxes unless it's a referendum, but those things would not get to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| It depends on the charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| The charge would come from the mayor, so none of us on this stage can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| Well, we can talk to the mayor, and that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| What would the committee, your committee, like to see, be eight or open-ended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Because it makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Our committee has only been concerned with nine since we began January 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| So you don't care about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| This committee hasn't taken up that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I'm not prepared to answer your question because I don't speak for a committee that has to vote on such a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| I can't say that this committee is one member that we would be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| That's unfair to ask me to respond to a committee about such a question that's brand new to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| Okay, well, my point is Monday I may be asked that question at the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| and I've got to be ready to cast a vote, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| And I'm not going to feel comfortable saying, if the mayor comes in here with a charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| that we can only talk about these eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Scott Moore, how do you vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Because I have to represent a lot more citizens than just a NOX charter petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| And if there's something else that needs to be talked about, we don't need to close the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| Your answer is that the charter says that it should be the duty of the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| to give ample opportunity to county officeholders and members of the public to make suggested changes to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| If it's open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| But if it's a specific charge, you can't go outside the mayor's charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| Could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| You cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Well, I'm speculating about what the charge would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| It depends on what the law focuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| It depends on what the charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| We need to shout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Give them ample opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Yeah, I think probably any committee would have it in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| Let me just ask a recognized Bob's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2406)|
| 0:40:16| Most people in this room, or in this neighborhood where I work, would be forced to know who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| And I'm an activist in the community and have been for more than a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| My first question would be a direct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| What happened to the nonpartisan component of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Well, the short answer is we might have had one or two individuals that said they loved the nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2435)|
| 0:40:44| And as a committee, we had a lot more feedback that said nonpartisan was not acceptable, including some of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2444)|
| 0:40:53| So, again, after a headcount, registered signatures, again, even tonight's meeting, I see some folks that have been at multiple meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2453)|
| 0:41:04| But after 400 to 500, a headcount of 400 to 500 individuals last year that participated in five separate meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2464)|
| 0:41:12| Actually, there was a sixth in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| And then online feedback that came back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Knox County, one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| We came to the determination at that point that just like the school board, that was an idea we wanted to put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| that was unanimously voted for last August, to have the commission elections nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| And that carried forward to the charter petition group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Now, in the last six or seven weeks, we've had a lot of negative feedback about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| How much is a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| How much is a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Because you said you had 600 people participate in the majority of what you said they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Now you're saying, and I'm going somewhere with this, if I may, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| And now, you know, here in the last 10 days or so, it disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| Well, 80-some members of the total committee had feedback come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| And, frankly, sir, I don't know how many specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| If I may make a comment, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I was involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| I've been involved in several public processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| The Knox County one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Knox County one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| I attended two meetings in addition to the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| And nowhere do I recall in that meeting process, for those people that did not attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| nowhere do I recall in that process where I ever asked, do you want this taken to a referendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2547)|
| 0:42:36| Now, I say that because I think that the one question folks were presumptive in assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2556)|
| 0:42:45| that the data that they accumulated and the decisions they made were intended by the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| that participated to go to a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| With that said, it would have been wonderful if we had had a county commission that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2575)|
| 0:43:04| taken a leadership role or a county executive that had taken a leadership role to do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| those folks did and use something like the commission appointment process to elect committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| members to create a committee to review the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| It would have been wonderful if all those things had happened, but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| And now what I find is that we have a rush to judgment here on the part of those people that are for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| and those people that are against this charter revision or review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| And I'm concerned that we're not going to do quality work just because of the fact of who started it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2621)|
| 0:43:52| who's opposed to it, and the simple fact that we haven't had an opportunity to digest the events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| of this past year with regard to county commission and the ongoing events in the county executive's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| office at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| So my concern and my question to all of you, and I would have you answer this question in your own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2647)|
| 0:44:14| heart and in your privacy, I'm talking to the commissioners now, in the privacy of your own mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| is this the right time and the right place to be proposing to review the charter and make these kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| of dynamic and dramatic changes to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| I would like to, and I'm offering a personal opinion here, but with regard to the nonpartisan component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| I can tell you from working in neighborhood activities, when you don't have a nonpartisan component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| and I'd like to see it in any future process, you are disenfranchising a significant portion of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2683)|
| 0:44:53| There's people in this room, I know there's county commissioners that I supported on both sides of the ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| and when I was working the precinct down here at Alice Fell for the candidate that I supported in this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| I can't tell you the number, but I can tell you that it was more than half of the people felt disenfranchised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| because they wanted to vote for a specific candidate, which may have been a Republican or a Democrat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| but because of the election they were in, they had to make a choice between their presidential choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| or their commissioner's choice, and that's not an appropriate way to include everybody in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| So, with that said, you obviously know where I stand on the nonpartisan component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| but I would suggest that we step back, cool off, and let commission, or in conjunction with the county executive's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2738)|
| 0:45:50| do an open process like you did with applications for appointments, and come up with a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| that represents the activists in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Somebody made a comment a minute ago that only a handful of people made these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2762)|
| 0:46:10| Well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| It's a minority in your community that are activists that drive the bus in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| and those people are the ones that are most engaged, most involved, understand the issues the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| and those are the people that need to be driving this bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| and you need to be having a review process to get those people engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| and let them bring the rest of your constituents to the table and find out where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| Thank you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| I know that Commissioner Pinkston has been waiting a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| then Commissioner Smith needs to be rolling to another event, so let's go in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Tom or Brad, either one, can ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| You're talking about our fee offices compared to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| Did you check to see if they do the same work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Well, as it comes to tax collection, as it comes to issuing a driver's license and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2821)|
| 0:47:10| I went on the assumption that a lot of those fee offices duplicate the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| but if you have other information, I'd be glad to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| Well, let's say like our clerk's office here, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| We make timers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Let's just use that, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Maybe these other offices do a lot more work, too, that these other counties don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Then another thing on these appointment processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| we've seen that that brings in cronyism by the mayor's own office here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| but what you get into when you get these appointment processes, I'm going to use an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| Look at how the superintendent's salary is exploding right now from the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| Also, look at how these people in under the mayor that he has appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| that how their salary has exploded from the time he took office to what it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| Then you go back to this inspector general to give you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| Y'all were wanting to tie that in with the law director's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Now you're down to 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| That's still $130,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| The auditor that we have right now does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| He makes $86,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Him and his complete staff make $156,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| So you're talking about an appointment job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Then we have to furnish him all the help he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| We're going to blow this thing up to maybe anywhere from three-quarters of a million to half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| if we're getting done for $156,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| That's what we get into these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Now, if you want to talk about salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| if you go to the state and what the guidelines are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| the state says, of course, we're running in under charge of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| A county the size of 400,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| the state recommends the minimum salary for the mayor to be $123,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| I believe we're paying out $148,000 plus a P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| Maybe I'm wrong, but you've done all these studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| but you're comparing apples and oranges, in my opinion, in a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| Again, Commissioner Fischer, we can nickel and dime this for $20,000 a year, $40,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| and I'm going to get to the IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| This is a really big one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| You're the one who started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I don't mind finishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| The fact is, it's an issue for me of control, commission having budgetary control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2967)|
| 0:49:36| of folks not being able to hire and submit a legal filing that I—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| frankly, this is news to me that the mayor had to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| but if he faces a lawsuit, you know, what mayor wants to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| That choice, in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| But he's probably going to rubber stamp any of these things coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| But that being aside, an IG—again, Commissioner Fischer, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| you cut my—my father-in-law cut your hair, and I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| But the fact of the matter is, when it comes to this IG, he is not, he or she,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| is not the same person that this internal auditor is, not the same job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| If you'll let me finish, this IG is intended as designed to be completely independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3012)|
| 0:50:21| not beholden to a mayor, county commission, sheriff—no offense, JJ—school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| I mean, this IG can go into what I call the four horsemen of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| those four I just named, and look anywhere for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| and not be at the charge of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Now, I don't have anything against this current internal auditor at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| but I—just my little brain in business says that this county spent about $3 billion over five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3040)|
| 0:50:49| and it took us five years to find $200,000 in misuse of funds, innocent mistakes to fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3049)|
| 0:50:59| And I don't know which, because I don't pass judgment until a final audit's out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| until the legal system can do—offer due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| But the fact of the matter is, $200,000 out of $3 billion, give or take a half a billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| says to me that over five years, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| There's annual audits, there's regular audits that go on in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| and we just now caught it after five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Now, an IG, I don't care if it costs a quarter of a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| I don't care if it costs a half a billion dollars, or a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| Well, let me correct you on something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| If that individual is truly independent in the center of those four quadrants of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| and can go after the mayor to look at the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| the county commission is hardly anything in expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Again, J.J., no offense, but the sheriff's department has a healthy budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| and the school board is two-thirds of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| then obviously there are things to be caught along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| And, Paul, I love your question, because I know Larry has to be running—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| No, I was just going to correct him on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| Very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Okay. Our internal auditor does go into these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Does he not, Johnny, look for things just like the IG does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| Our internal auditor is independent more so than someone the mayor appoints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| because he reports to 19 commissioners plus the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| Any one of us can ask him to audit something, even though he's already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| But when the IG is appointed to the mayor, he is the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| What would be going on right now if our internal auditor was the one auditing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| was controlled by the mayor and auditing the mayor right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| The internal—the IG, which Dr. Briggs speaks very eloquently about IGs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| of course in military service, but an IG in this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| would go through an HR process, a human resources process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| There would be, I imagine, many applications because, as you put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| it's a very lucrative job and it's a very worthwhile public service job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| But this—you would have a slew of IG candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| HR would go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| The mayor would recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| and county commission could grill, vet, decline, approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| That's the checks and balances that are—that's the common thread through all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| that I'm that passionate about, that this creates what I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| and you can disagree, a truly independent auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| that wouldn't have taken necessarily five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| And, Mr. Owings, would you weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| County commission direct the internal auditor today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| Can the mayor say, go check out the school board budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| Can the mayor send the internal auditor anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| The internal auditor is the commission's employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| But he does say the mayor can direct him, too, doesn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| The internal auditor pretty much listens to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Okay, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Let's go to that commissioner who's been waiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| and then this gentleman in the back can take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| I've got the list here, and you talked about some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| I'm going to ask you, what is your executive committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| Gary's more—Gary took off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| He's more qualified to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| You're talking about the smaller committee, the steering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| The coordinating committee versus the steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| I believe the steering committee is the larger number of coordinating committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| I've got the steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| I've got that list of all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| But you've got to keep mentioning that executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Who is your decision-maker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| At the last meeting, Monday night, I can name the members that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| But naming the total members where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| I can't do that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Well, I've got this thing here that you all put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| This might be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Don Burnell, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Smith, Treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Malden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| You.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| That's Palmer Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Mary Lou Kanat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Tom Jensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Lawrence Tellick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Is that your executive committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| That's the coordinating committee, and that is the only executive committee we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| Well, there were more than that at Monday night's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| The Monday night meetings, there's more folks there than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| The steering committee comes to the Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| This gentleman's awake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| You know, you're all's motto has been let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| If this inspector general is so important, why not let the people vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Let's make it an elected office if it's that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Let the people decide if they want to elect an inspector general who truly is independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| and accurate to nobody but the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| And, sir, my only response to that would be that is a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| that we need to take to the review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| I would consider voting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| That's the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| I'm tired of the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| And I mean for my folks, you have before you not only a little survey form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| but also a place for comments and suggestions as well as wording changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| Other hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| I have Mary again from the petitioner's decrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| My question is sort of in response to last night's forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| when Dr. Riggs got up to speak about the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| And this may be directed to our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| This charter review committee, would it, depending on the charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| and we've heard this night, it will not come back to the county commission for yea, nay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| either straight to the ballot, whatever they determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Straight to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| Bob, you had a question or a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Sort of a great segue, Mr. Priest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| I mean, my advocacy a moment ago for having a different process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| is exactly three things that just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| One, this gentleman offered a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| and that concerns me that an issue that's important to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| the nonpartisan component got left off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| and a committee, your committee, one of your committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| I don't know how many committees you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| but one of your committees made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| And now people, but you've got to see some resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| You've got to see some qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| And for the most part, you were dealing with community activists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| the people that actually on a day-to-day basis look out for their neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| that are too busy or not engaged or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| And I would strongly recommend this commission reconsider the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| There's no rush to do anything here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| We've had major upheaval in our community for the last year and a half or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| It's not done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| And we have one more important component that's in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| It's called term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| So I think there's an exceptional opportunity for us to do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| I think there's an extraordinary rush here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| and I would encourage you to sit back, take a breath, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| Just to add something to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| and I think we've all talked about public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| and that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| I mean, I think if we have this jury review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and we limit it to these eight things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| and we don't let the people come sit against what they want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| I think we're making a bad mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I think that's when you're going to get public outcry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| I think the Consumer Attorney Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| would have public hearings and public sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| But what I'm saying is if you limit it to these eight terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| then it would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Because Mr. Briggs, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| did not pull back my simplified K-4 taxpayer bill of rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| and put it in with this process Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| I don't quite remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| I remember when you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| I said, I'll call you right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| I know that it's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Okay, let's try that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| I want to also make sure I give preference to members of the public here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| We've heard from a lot of people whose title is commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| I don't mind that I happen to have one of those titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| But anyone that's a member of the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Okay, one more thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| I'm not worried at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Okay, then Commissioner Dufresne and then Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| I really appreciate what Bob had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I feel that this has been a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| I feel that there's been some flaws in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| and I would really like to make sure, like Bob just now said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| that we go through with this and we don't have any regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| We can't afford any regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| Just kind of the same line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I mean, you know, we're talking about changing our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| So if it takes us a year or two years or 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| to get it the way people really want it, what is really hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| People, let me tell you, sitting on that commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| making those appointments January 3rd, people didn't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| We got convicted of violating the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Whatever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| But now, the only thing we heard during that time was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| We don't want you folks appointing anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| That was during the first appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| And now you all are appointing all these office holders appointed by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| People said we're going to turn limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| And we finally got these people out, and we got some new people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| And now these people would become, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| as long as they could get along with whoever the next mayor is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| time after time after time, they could stay on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| So I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| In January, we're all about term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| We're all about making sure these people don't stay in these offices forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| because they're not lifetime jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| And now if you're taking the term limits back away from the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| that took us from 94 to 2006 to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| so I don't understand that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| The other issue is at the Baker Center study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| and we mentioned it last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| was that the norm for a county commission of a town our size is 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| That's the normal size across all the cities and counties you all look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| And then you all say, well, we thought 19's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| 17's the norm, so we come up with 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| And nobody can really tell us how 11 really came up with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| other than we just wanted to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| And you made a comment just a minute ago, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| that, and I may be wrong, and that's why I'm asking you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| you said that on the nonpartisan, you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| well, there's two or three people that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| were really as strong for it, others wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| so we just thought it wasn't worth the fight to pull it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| When Marge Tullock spoke to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| and I'm going to go back and listen to the tape and make sure I'm right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| but I believe he said, these are the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| we're bringing these nine questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| because these were the things that were passed unanimously by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| So in your statement just a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| well, there's two or three that really were in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| and we decided it isn't worth the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| So was it unanimous, or was it two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| It was both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| Again, the love and appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Because we can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| So it was unanimous when you went forward with the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| I can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| I appreciate the love and question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| But the fact of the matter is, last year's effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| last year's recommendations, again, this is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| you miss a few finer details, and then, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| it does sound rather silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| But last year's effort, separate from this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| there was a unanimous vote about these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| Again, there's a bigger picture to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| that these recommendations were sent on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| There was a three- or four-month, five-month process that was watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| and observed, and people knew it was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| and hundreds of people participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| And you can talk about the boiled-down numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| but I know the head count was 400 to 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| but we keep getting hammered with that one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| But the fact of the matter is, we had people participating over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| really, five meetings in May and one in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| a recap meeting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| And it was unanimous by the 56 members that were left in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| one question, because we had people drop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| Was it good in the tent, everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| And we said, you've got to be there if you're going to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Fifty-six members, unanimous, nine recommendations were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| It passed on to people in position, legislative and administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| to where either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| And to your point, I've been waiting to go back to your great point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| about nothing being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| For months, we dropped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| We made the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| The Knox County one-question group disbanded, and we dropped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| And we gave that breather, so to speak, for four or five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| knowing that there's specific deadlines for petition drives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| that are rather stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| In January, yes, and Scooby's quick to point out that there's five people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| that said maybe we should get a group together with some of the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| some new people, maybe we should get a new group together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| I don't think anything's going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| And we have tight timelines coming about these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| The mayor didn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| The county commission didn't do anything under its old leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| which, of course, we know is the person who asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| The fact is we put this together January 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| You saw it in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| You saw the recommendation, the letter go to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| and the opportunity to respectfully debate this within commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| And, yes, there was a harder line taken in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| It got softer as people started crying out that some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| could have legal problems, some of these things could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| There's two words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Mr. Owings in one in particular said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| if you remove two words, board indirectly, that might be an okay thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| It was under the employment, the county employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| If you take out board indirectly, we might have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| of that not causing legal problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| All of that feedback we listened to so that flexibility is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| respect is there, and you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| The nice thing is, bottom line is, this is now, this train has left the station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| There is a charter review committee that the mayor has taken on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| that this commission now has to decide whether or not they want to approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| whether they want to, I don't know the legal jargon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| but whether they want to approve this committee, ratify this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| If that's the case, then this is a great situation for more public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| expanded timelines on potential petition drive, which hopefully won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| Hopefully we'll have 9, 12, 8, whatever amendments that make it to the August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| or 15, whatever the people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| I think we're rapidly running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Commissioner, can I say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| I have a hand in the back that I haven't heard from yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| I'm just wondering, how many people here are not current office holders or candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3980)|
| 1:06:32| Good. They are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| Is there a question in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| I think it's very important that the county commission had a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| not to put a flawed amendment before the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| It's our responsibility to protect the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Flawed amendments can be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| You came forward and said these nine are all unnegotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| Now we find a little public input and pressure, lose consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| You take the impossibility of consolidating the school district commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| because they're taking our constitutional offices out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| So it makes me wonder about the quality of these amendments, how flawed they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4025)|
| 1:07:13| Kathy Hamilton said the reason why we got down to nine in a couple of counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| was because overwhelming interest in all these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Look at the data. It isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| I read all the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| I attended one of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Baker Center, 17 plus, about 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Your report, nine plus two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| Report, data, not consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| It sounds like another agenda was going on in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| Very, very flawed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Mr. Briggs, thank you for bringing it to the side of the review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| We must have the same commitment to this review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| No flawed amendment goes before the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Mr. Owens, have you spoken to the legal standing of all these amendments that you're analyzing yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| We've been addressing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Have you done it yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Have I done that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Have you given a legal standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| We're standing with the county commission first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Have you said the legality of all these amendments that you've spoken to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Have you spoken to county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Yes, we've spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Have you taken it both ways there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| No, sir, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| We've spoken at public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| We've addressed concerns about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I've not written a formal legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| We're having a second reading on the 24th of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| When are we going to get it, Mr. Owens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| We've already gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| The commission has already gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| The commission has certainly talked anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| I think these flawed amendments are very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Of course we want to have the capacity to reform our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| The flaws in your amendments are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| You've admitted them tonight, and yet previously there was no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| Now all these changes cause public pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| That's what's happened, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| What else is hidden in these amendments, Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| I think I'm very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| I would answer that legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I mean, again, this is another common thread that I don't think this group has ever differed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| We don't want to create greater grief for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| We've been through enough legal in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| We don't want to create years' worth of legal problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| So we have public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| You're cherry-picking my answer, and maybe I didn't give you the complete answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| The fact is public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Commissioner input, which, as a matter of fact, is usually larger public input that comes through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| And legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Our own legal counsel, as well, is respecting the law director to get with our legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| and try to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Again, to where we don't create greater grief for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| You get your mayor, King, who appoints all these, takes these counsel officers and appoints them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| You have a trustee that wants to, if the mayor says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| I want all of our county monies to go into a certain bank because I like this guy that owns this bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| The trustee says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| The mayor fires the trustee and puts somebody else in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| He can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| You know, the news center would have fun with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| He could do this, couldn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Mission approval on both claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Eleven people, reduced representation, can't talk to one another because of sunshine law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Mayor King lobbying all the time, a lot of pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| Could happen, couldn't it still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Well, if he has the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Just fire, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Quick, quick, quick items because we need to get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Just out of due respect, due respect, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| You mentioned the leadership of the commission during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| I don't know if you're asserting that nothing was done during a four or five month period on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| You have to remember we had an 11 member commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| We had a district that was not even represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| We were trying to get a commission full that would represent all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| before you make significant changes to the charter of this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| Now, I know you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| So, you know, we need to be honest to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| and say why the commission didn't just jump up and rally these things through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| because we had people in the community that were not even represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| Can I say one thing real quick in response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| My name is Elaine Davidson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| I'm a commissioner in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| and my counterpart, William Daniels, has commented about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| I personally, as a citizen, if these things had gone to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| and commission had voted on these without any representation in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| I would have cried for help because there wasn't anybody there to speak for our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| and I don't feel like that we would have been fairly represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| if we were left out of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| And so, regardless of what you think about how commission behaved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| I appreciate the fact that they did hold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| And just in listening in some of the discussions that we've been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| it seemed like there was just a presentation of these ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| and not any sort of what are you going to do about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| I didn't want to grab on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| Well, let's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| I've still got something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| You always have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Mr. Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Mr. Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Once you arrived, I thought this was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Sorry to keep you guys following me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| We're having a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| We're having a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| If you want to know why I'm here, I didn't know anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| At commission, nobody asked me anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Oh, I don't know if you know how a legislative process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| You meet with the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| You meet with the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080319forum?start=4349)|
