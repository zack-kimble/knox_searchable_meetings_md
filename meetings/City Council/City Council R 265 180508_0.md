| 0:04:04| and where she proposed her 2018-19 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=244)|

| 0:05:29| On Tuesday, May the 22nd, the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association, CAMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=329)|

| 0:05:44| Keep Knoxville Beautiful is participating with CAMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| Merchants and volunteers are welcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| so if anybody wants to go help clean up Cumberland Avenue from just debris that gets thrown around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| Parking is available for that event at Copper Cellar in the upper lots near White Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| or extra parking in McDonald's across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=361)|

| 0:06:10| So if you haven't been to Cumberland Avenue since we completed the redo of Cumberland Avenue last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| you really ought to drive down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| We've got 90 large trees that have now leafed out, so spring is upon us, and it's really looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| With the new LED lights and the new stormwater infrastructure that was part of the redo of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| the Cumberland Avenue area is more sustainably responsible than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| Runoff water reaching Third Creek is the cleanest in modern times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| so the May 22nd litter cleanup will help kind of get rid of the debris that we all see, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| as we go up and down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Finally, the Concerts on the Square series is now officially underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=412)|

| 0:17:54| and I would ask our attorney, Rob, to make a comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| Tonight, for five of you all, is a brand new item on your agenda dealing with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| and a lot of the budget is mandated by the city charter, and specifically Section 901 of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1089)|
| 0:18:20| and I'll briefly go over what the charter requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| The fiscal year for the city of Knoxville begins on the first day of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| The mayor has certain duties under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Between 105 days and 75 days prior to the commencement of the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| the mayor is to put together from the department's boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| and commissions the information necessary to compile the annual operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| The scope of the budget is to contain certain items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| which include an estimate of the unencumbered fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| or deficit at the beginning of the ensuing fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| a reasonable estimate of revenues to be received during the ensuing year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| and proposed expenditures for each department, board, commission, or other agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| And you'll see that as it's reflected, and it'll be gone over in next Thursday's budget workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| There's also a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| In no event shall the proposed expenditures from any fund exceed the total anticipated revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| plus the estimated inappropriate surplus or fund balance and the applicable reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| Further, and this is what you all had on and the public had on April 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| not later than 60 days prior to the commencement of the next ensuing fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| the mayor shall submit to the council the operating budget as approved and recommended by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| in the form and with the content specified in the preceding section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Now, council, as part of section 901E of the charter, the council will conduct public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1202)|
| 0:20:14| Part E says the council shall pass the budget ordinance on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| and thereafter the council shall hold public hearings on the proposed operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| as well as on the capital improvement budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| After the conclusion of the public hearings, the council may amend the operating budget proposed by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| except that the budget, as finally amended and adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| must provide for all expenditures required by law or by other provisions of this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| The council shall not alter the estimates of the receipts or other fund availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| included in the budget document, except to correct errors and omissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| in which event a full explanation shall be in the minutes of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| In no event shall the total appropriations from any fund exceed the estimated fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| reserves, and revenues constituting the availability of such fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| The council shall finally adopt an operating budget for the ensuing fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| not later than the 15th day prior to the commencement of the next ensuing fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| If the council shall fail to adopt a budget prior to the 15th day preceding the commencement of the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| it shall be conclusively presumed to have adopted the budget as submitted by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| It goes on further, but if for some reason council strays and spends money that's not there, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1291)|
| 0:21:42| or violates anything that I previously discussed, it's actually a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| And this has been part of the city charter, which ultimately is voted upon and passed by the voters of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1309)|
| 0:21:58| originally passed in 1990 and was further modified in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1318)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you, Mr. Frost. Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Now, is there a motion to adopt the budget on the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| I haven't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| I haven't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| 12A is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| agencies, and funds of the city of Knoxville for the fiscal year period beginning July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1344)|
| 0:22:34| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| I know that Ms. Welsh wants to make a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Oh, thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| I just want to disclose to council and to the public that one of the items in this budget is to fund part of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1363)|
| 0:22:52| schools initiative through Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| I am the president of Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| I'm the president of Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| None of this funding actually pays for my salary, but it does support work that our organization does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| So that's my disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Ms. Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| I just wanted some clarification on how when we are doing this first vote on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| that it's not including, it doesn't have anything specifically to do with the MOU with Knoxville Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| And I'm wondering if David Brace could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| With Knoxville College, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| I believe David Brace, COO, this initial vote, and Rob can clarify, is to bring this budget to the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1411)|
| 0:23:40| the legislative budget hearings, and then a final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And so the MOU at Knoxville College is a non-binding MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| The mayor has proposed funding for a much-needed KPD, KFD facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| And so we're bringing this budget, and I think the vote would bring this budget to the next step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| Is that correct, Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| I think if something is planned and worked out, because somebody can correct me, this will be undergoing a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1444)|
| 0:24:13| This would not be the final vote under any circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Whatever agreement, if there's an agreement reached, will come back to council for a vote as it would stand alone, I would believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| Dr. Lyons may confirm or deny or clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Yes, the council would take action with a development agreement subsequent to the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and having all the details being worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| That would be the point where council would have a vote on that specific item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Yeah, let's stay on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| So tonight we're going to vote on it, and then next Thursday we're having a public meeting to discuss it in great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1487)|
| 0:24:56| And then the following Tuesday will be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| It'll be back on for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| We don't have to pass it that night, but we have to pass it in two weeks after that, by June 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| That's going to be the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| So we have two more meetings before June 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Rob, you're saying we have 15 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Fifteen days before the beginning of the fiscal year, so it would be the middle of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| Middle of June, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| So we have two more meetings after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| But I guess there's things in the budget that are indebtedness for the new building that you just mentioned, $40 million for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1521)|
| 0:25:32| Are we binding ourselves if we approve this budget after our meetings, not tonight on the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| Are we binding ourselves to that indebtedness with the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| He says yes, and you say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| So let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Well, it gives, and I can have Jim York speak to this, but it gives us, the mayor and the administration, the permission to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| But is that not right, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Yeah, Jim York, our chief financial officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| What the budget does is the budget sets the appropriations for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| A lot of the specifics that you're asking about are ministerial-type activities and are not covered in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1565)|
| 0:26:16| For example, you give requisitions or you approve contracts and so forth all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| The appropriation basically gives you the authority to spend that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| But there are a lot of things that come after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| So, for example, we have proposed in this budget the issuance of new debt, but we may end up working that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1591)|
| 0:26:40| But you still have the appropriation to spend up to, again, $36 million, for example, on a new police facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1600)|
| 0:26:49| But you're not committing yourself to the where, when, how, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| Again, this is much broader than what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| You're trying to, the budget does not get into that level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| We're committed to, so even the debt service would not be reflected in the budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| Because that would certainly be way out into the, more into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| The debt service, you do have a portion that's related to debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| but that is for existing debt service and an issue that we have planned for, it will probably happen in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1636)|
| 0:27:25| That relates to the street lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Any future debt issue will still have to come before you if you remember the issuance of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| I don't remember the exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| I think it was about two or three council meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| It comes before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| We cannot borrow without that first step and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Neither can we spend more than $25,000 on certain contracts without coming back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| even though the appropriation is laid out in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Again, this one just sets parameters, outside parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| but a lot of the details get filled in and are ministerial in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Right, so we're not approving the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| So essentially with the $40,000 was the number I had, $40,000 for that new facility plus $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1685)|
| 0:28:15| $10 million for the lights and $10 million for urban wilderness and $10 million for the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1695)|
| 0:28:22| So we're up to $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| We're not committing ourselves to have to approve those financing options at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1704)|
| 0:28:32| We're just improving in concept that we're agreeable to discussing it, putting it in the budget to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1712)|
| 0:28:40| but we're not binding ourselves to that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| So what you're doing is you're setting the parameters from an appropriation standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| but the exact funding mechanism, those tend to get worked out later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| Exactly how it worked out with the building and location of the building and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| but still yet, even though we might approve it in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| it's still in this budget proposal in a few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| it's still subject to further votes and further discussion and a lot more details will be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| So we're not bound by it whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Again, all you're doing is setting the appropriation limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you, Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| Is there a motion to approve the budget on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Mr. Vice Mayor, excuse me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Mr. Moja, I'm sorry, wait until public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| On this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| When do the citizens get a chance to weigh in on this particular issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| You will get a chance on May 17th at public forum when we have the entire budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| We have not approved the budget in the final form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| We've made the first reading and now it goes to our hearing and then back to council on May 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| Yeah, but that particular issue is not quite transparent as far as why would you have a first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| and then adopt it without any kind of vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Yeah, well, we've already discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Mr. Frost read the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| That is what is commanded of us by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| Right, it didn't say why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| It said what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| It didn't say why we're supposed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| My question is why would we have a city council meeting on this issue if citizens didn't get a chance to talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1828)|
| 0:30:36| or if the city council didn't get a chance to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| But we do get a chance to talk about it on May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| No, I'm talking about the first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| I'm not talking about the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Then we have the second reading, so we will talk about it all day on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| Now, the public forum part of that day will be at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| It is a meeting for council to discuss each department within the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| and we will discuss that all day long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| and then at 5 o'clock we will allow the public to weigh in and make whatever comments they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| Okay, well, I'd like to state that this procedure that we follow tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| I would like to find out what can be done to amend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| because it doesn't allow the citizens to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| And if we're talking about $300 million or $400 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| at any phase there should be a way that the citizens can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| I think it should be this way or I think it should be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| So I just want to register that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Vice Mayor Saunders, could we give Moja three minutes to speak on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1897)|
| 0:31:47| Because I think if he had signed up that he would be allowed to speak on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| He would be, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| If you would like to sign up for the end of our meeting, we do have a public forum if you want to make some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| If council is okay, five minutes or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| So we will proceed with our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| and then if you want to make a comment at the end during public forum, we will certainly listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| I mean, if he's there, I mean, I'm asking if council is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| we could suspend the rules and have him do his five minutes now to give his opinion on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| I guess that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Is there a consensus on council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| I don't, I'm hearing, I'm watching heads shake, so I guess there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| So Moja, you have, give me your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| My name is Umoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| I live at 417 Clark Street in Mechanicsville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| and I actually hear there's some annexation that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| so we're getting ready to be part of the city, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| It's a very serious matter what we're talking about doing as far as, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| as I mentioned the word transparency, one of the things that I have been involved in since I came home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| I came home out of the Air Force in 1970, and Mayor Leonard Rogers was the mayor at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| and so I've been pretty much active along with a lot of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| in trying to be sure that we understand what's going on as it relates to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| and that we're actually able to participate in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| And so this particular procedure, which talks about automatically that in the first reading that is accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| I think there probably, and I could be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| but I think there probably is some consternation among the city council people themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| because that sounds as if it's a dictatorial edict that regardless of whether five city council people or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| felt something different about that first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| then they would not even feel comfortable saying that, well, let's look at this a little more in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| or let's look at it to find out how the citizens can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| So I think that in seriousness that we should actually look at this first particular reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| because if we're not going to do anything at all, it shouldn't even be a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| It should be just something that goes, you know, it just should be commonplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| But we actually say it's a reading and then there's no actually reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| There's no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| The only decision that's made is that we're going to wait to the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and then at the public hearing the public will get a chance to do some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| My question also is that at this first reading, when the second reading comes or when the hearing comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| are all the same details in the budget as there are in this first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Are there line items or specific things that may change that aren't in it now or that are in it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| that may not be in the public hearing and also in the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| So really my reason for being here is to ensure that we do have more citizen participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| more what we call people-powered or people-democracy, and all of you are people for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| so it's not like you're not people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| However, I think that we should actually have a way to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and to make Knoxville the kind of place where it doesn't look like or it doesn't appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| that everything is not clear especially when it comes to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| because that's the primary responsibility of the city council people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| to vote on that budget and also to see that equity is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| as the budget is divided throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| I'm not sure I could discuss the situation specifically about Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| and the memorandum of understanding and those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| I feel like what has happened is that more ideas have surfaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| about how to actually grow Knoxville College and actually how to help Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| My understanding is Knoxville College asked for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| They did not actually ask for either police precinct or headquarters or fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| They asked for help from the city and that some knowledgeable person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| or some thoughtful person or some visionary in the city of Knoxville said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| well, this is a good idea since we need to put the precinct somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| let's put it at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| There's been talk about a school pre-K through college being put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| no, pre-K through, yes, college, put on Knoxville College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| no, pre-K through high school being put on Knoxville College campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| There's been some ideas about maybe stretching Beardsley Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| because I know the city did put together a proposal for the Bloomberg grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| for what was called a food desert and so Beardsley is right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| So there are a lot of things that we feel like, both in Mechanicsville, Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| and Beaumont residents that would benefit that area much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| You have up to one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you, sir, much more than what we have thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| So let's pull together and let's see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| I appreciate the time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you for your comments, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2209)|

| 0:37:56| Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Yeah, let's ask Ms. Hatfield to come down and talk a little bit about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| and what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| You wouldn't want to miss an opportunity to hear from her, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Vicki Hatfield, Civil Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| There's a number of key things listed here that you've given us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I just kind of wanted to go over and make sure that we're aware of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| First, you've been doing these annual reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| and getting input from other cities every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| and you're proposing to go to three years for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| And a 3% increase instead of a 2.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| And then some additional strategy and increase for new recruits for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| I just wanted to talk a little bit about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| and anything else you wanted to make sure we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| And I tend to be a little long-winded, so I'll do my best to keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Those are the key points of this class comp ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Typically, you'll see this once a year with the budget ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| Sometimes there may be a small one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| But this is the comprehensive change to the classification and compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| That would be the listing of all of our job classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| and their descriptions would be the classification system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| And then how those fit into a pay structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| and any changes recommended to that pay structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| would be the compensation portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| I have recommended some changes this year that aren't typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| One of those is moving the salary survey process to a three-year cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| as opposed to an annual cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| It's been on an annual cycle as long as I've been here, which is almost 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| I think it's been on that cycle for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| The charter just requires that civil service do a survey periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| I will note that most cities do not do one as frequently as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| Many cities don't do one at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| They may do one very, very rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Larger cities like ours might do one on a less frequent basis, maybe every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| So still doing it every three years is more aggressive than most of our peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| The reason I'm making that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| In the past, we really didn't have a lot of trouble getting responses to our survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| We typically got about a 50% response rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| We send it to anywhere, usually about 100 to 120 respondents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| that are typically peer municipalities and counties in the southeast region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| and we usually get about a 50% response rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| We've seen that response rate dropping for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| The last, I'm going to say, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| we have struggled every year to get even a reasonable response rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| We spend a lot of extra time extending deadlines, making phone calls, begging for data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| And this year, our response rate dropped below 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| And the truth is that's very difficult data to make good recommendations on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| I don't have a lot of confidence in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| because it's a very small portion of the data we're trying to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| And the feedback that we've gotten from other cities is this is a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| A survey takes a lot of time to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| It's a large document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| It's a lot of data for that other city to fill out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| And they basically said you're doing this too often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| We can't do it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| So that is one reason I've recommended moving it out to a requirement of every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| That doesn't mean we can't do it more frequently if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| We could still do it annually if requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| We could do it every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| So it can still be done on a more frequent schedule if requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| It simply removes that requirement that it be annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| The reason for the 3% adjustment, so that is a different recommendation than I would normally make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| This is tied to my recommendation to move that survey to every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| What we've been doing as long as I've been here is we make recommendations every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| to make changes to that compensation structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| So basically moving those amounts up for minimums, maximums, and midpoints of each job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| moving those up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| There's a cost associated with that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| When we do that, I'm just making recommendations to the structure, not the actual pay of city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| So if I move a pay grade up 4%, the employees in that pay grade stay at the salary they're currently at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2553)|
| 0:42:42| If we give a 2.5% increase and I've moved the structure up 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| in effect that employee's position relative to their midpoint drops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| And that's okay as long as those movements are conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| But what we found in 2008 was that doing that for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| over a long period of time, our employees' position in their pay grade continues to get lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| because we're raising the structure at a more aggressive rate than we're raising the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| So in an effort to not get us back in a position that we were in in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| when we had to do a comprehensive and expensive survey and salary adjustment to our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| my goal going forward is to move that structure adjustment to a three-year cycle rather than annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| in hopes that we will be able to move employees at the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| We can't commit to that, but certainly if the budget can accommodate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| So if we move the structure 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| my hope would be that we can move employees at a more aggressive rate with the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| when those changes happen so that our employees don't lag in the structure as we move the structure up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| So that's another reason to move it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| because my hope is that by shifting that structure cycle to every three years rather than every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| we can afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| With regard to any questions on that before I move to the recruitment issue with police and fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| You'll also see that I have recommended a more aggressive adjustment to police officer recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| and firefighter recruit and police officer one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| The reason for that is we actually have not raised recruit in quite a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| I want to say it might have been since we did the Segal survey, probably in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| That might be the last time we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I won't swear to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| But we typically have not adjusted those recruit rates because we have not had difficulty recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| What we found in the last two years is that we're having an extremely difficult time recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| for both police officer and firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| We're seeing more difficulty with police officer than firefighter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| but both have significantly dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| In past years, we would see 500, 600, 700 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| We're struggling to get 200 applicants now with our most recent processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| Our last process to try to hire police recruits was so poor that literally as soon as we started the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2708)|
| 0:45:17| we reposted police officer recruit because we could not fill the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| And it's very expensive, just to be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| That hiring process is extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| So if we can, doing it two times in such a short period of time is fairly costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| If we can increase our recruitment by increasing that entry salary while they're in the academy, get more applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| I think that's going to, one, it's going to save the city from having to do that process again at a pretty great expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| And we need to fill those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| They're going unfilled for a very long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| So I'm recommending that we raise those to try to aid in recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| And the increase to police officer is we tend to lose more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| We don't have poor turnover in police and fire once we get them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| But where we do see the most turnover is when they're first hired in police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| We lose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| We lose a good number during the academy, surprisingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| So I'm hoping that by increasing the pay for the recruit while they're in the academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| and giving them the promise of a slightly better pay increase when they graduate from the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| we'll be able to retain those officers because hiring them is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| And once we get them here, we don't want them to leave after two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So that's the reason for those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2805)|

| 0:47:46| I can talk on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Talahi Park, I don't know, is that the same as Cherokee Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Well, Cherokee Boulevard has a number of public amenities, fountains, public park spaces, and then there's actually the park on Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2873)|
| 0:48:03| And so these are dollars that will match a state allocation as well as private fundraising to renovate public facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2883)|
| 0:48:14| so the fountain in the middle of Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| And so the mayor is dedicating dollars to help leverage state and private money, again, to upgrade this fountain, and it is a public amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2897)|
| 0:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| It's for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| The fountain is right there, and Talahi Park, and then you go down to Squaw Heels Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| And so the Kingston Pike Squaw Heels folks and the Preservation Association have done similar projects along the boulevard to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2913)|
| 0:48:41| and put dollars into public amenities and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2921)|

| 0:49:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I just would like to disclose that I had been involved in a fundraising campaign with a local charity in which Covenant Health has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| and continues to be a corporate sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| After consulting with our council attorney who conferred with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| it was determined that this is not even an indirect conflict with my participation in this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Therefore, I intend to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| This looks like it has to do with the expansion of the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| and there's a couple other items on our agenda that also deal with this, I believe, later on in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| I thought they were a little premature because it was my understanding there was conversations between the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| and the hospital along with Councilmember Welch and some other people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3015)|
| 0:50:23| So I see, and I talked with Mr. Birmingham today, so I'd just like to call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| Well, we do have three people signed up to speak for this, speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Well, maybe we should have those go ahead first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Patrick Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Trustee Voska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Mr. Mayor, Members of Council, we will waive our right to speak if that's your all's pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| and simply answer questions like Councilman Starr has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Do you have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Well, I guess I'd just talk about why this is before us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| an update on where we are with the different groups that you're working with and the general plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3058)|
| 0:51:08| If you would, in addressing these questions, please identify yourself and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| My name is Rusty Baxa with Land Development Solutions, 310 Simmons Road, Suite K, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| The purpose of this is because this process is such a long process to close the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| So because of the timing of the overall project, we needed to have this be a first action, early action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| because, again, of the first and second reading, the Quick Claim Deeds preparation application to get that alley closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3095)|
| 0:51:43| So all the items that are on the agenda today are items that are south of the alley that are not in the overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3103)|
| 0:51:55| So we proceeded, and the other items also require a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| and we had a date that we had to hit because the plan amendments are only heard quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| That does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| I don't know if Mr. Birmingham wanted to talk about the efforts to reach out to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Patrick Birmingham, 280 Fort West Boulevard, Suite 202, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| There has been a number of conversations ongoing with both representatives in the neighborhood as well as Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| and actually Knox Heritage is in support of the overall project of what we're trying to do there with the expansion for the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3151)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Well, like I said, I have some heartburn about the timing of these when those negotiations are still ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3163)|
| 0:52:52| but I appreciate the hospital reaching out to the neighborhood, and obviously it's a huge part of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| and it's a fragile neighborhood, and I think the hospital could really be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| and needs to be an anchor there and a leader in improving that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| So I appreciate those efforts and appreciate you coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Councilman Starr, thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I couldn't agree more that I think the Fort Sanders neighborhood is in a place right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| where a partnership with Knox Heritage and the hospital will be really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| and the city, to keep that neighborhood moving forward in a positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| I know that Mr. Birmingham has been working with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| We've had many conversations along the way, and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you for your time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| I'm glad that we're paying attention to this because I do think that we're in a critical point with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| and its relationship with the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Some of the details that Mr. Birmingham referred to, there's more steps in the process moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| so we're in ongoing discussions right now about sort of what that's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| how the end of this expansion process will actually be a mutually beneficial outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| for the neighborhood, Knox Heritage, and the hospital, which ultimately benefits the health of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| So that's the direction we're headed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3264)|

| 0:56:07| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| I am here on behalf of Knox Rail Salvage, its owners, Mike Fraser, his family, and Joel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| We had a lengthy discussion on this issue several meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| Knox Rail Salvage, as you know, is an old downtown resident, a business that services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| not only the downtown community but central Knoxville and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| It is in the process of sort of changing its focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| With the acquisition of the White Lily Flower office building and others, they are putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| a kitchen shop in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| They are really becoming more of a hardware store where you compete with Lowe's, Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| Depot, Ace Hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| And they are locally owned, unlike the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| They need to move an unsightly pile of lumber at the corner of Depot and Morgan over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3422)|
| 0:57:12| a lot on the east side, or excuse me, west side of the property, which is the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| of this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| The property is currently zoned C3, which does not allow outside storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| We came here with a recommendation of denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| You all returned it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| MPC recommended industrial for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| The owners of Knox Rail Salvage thought that was an inappropriate recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| They requested C4, which is a commercial zone that would allow outside storage of lumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| MPC recommended an amendment to the city's one-year plan to general commercial for this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| and recommended the C4 with screening around it so that the storage of the lumber would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3478)|
| 0:58:08| not be visible to the general public either driving or walking back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| And we support that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| I realize there are some issues with C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| The primary one appears to be car lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Well, I've not seen a car lot in the city of Knox behind an opaque fence with landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| where you could not see the cars on display or for sale there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| So I doubt that these owners, they have no intention of putting a car lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| That's never been a business they're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| But if you all would approve the MPC recommendation, we can start improving the street front on depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3521)|
| 0:58:53| The fencing would be required around this lot where the storage is as well as landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| and there would have to be compliance with the new city parking ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| which requires further landscaping interior, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| But we would ask you all to approve this so we can move ahead with the updated plans for Knox Rail Salvage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3549)|
| 0:59:19| and for improving an area that they are already in the process of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Does Mr. Piper want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| Paul Piper, 6116 Montrachet Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| I sat through two commencement exercises this weekend, so I want to be judicious with your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3579)|
| 0:59:46| I would rather, I can do a dog and pony show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| I've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| But if you just want to ask me questions, I'll be good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Briefly, I'll just say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| I want to save time in case the opposition speaks, and I want to address some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| But I want to be very brief, and I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Of course, we're back with a C-4 recommendation from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| The primary complaint initially of those opposed to our request was the expansion of an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| So today we're addressing both of those complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| The other complaint was street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| So today we're before you with a commercial four zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| You can see from the renderings we paid Michael Brady Architectural Firm to do some renderings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| and we're committed to those renderings, to making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| Obviously, we're good with having conditions for occupancy on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| You know that we have to have the screening there and the fencing and all that done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| so we're agreeable to those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| At the initial meeting, I met with Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| She asked me, do you need I-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| And I said, we don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| We just want to use that lot for outdoor storage because she said the opposition was opposed to an industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| and C-4 came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| So MPC has worked very hard, Director Green, and this is a compromised zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| and hopefully it will appease our opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| It helps us grow as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| It eliminates the industrial zone that has been so controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| So with that, I'll be glad to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Are there any questions of Mr. Piper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Can you go through, I guess, the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| and I guess what you're going to do on the perimeter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Well, the MPC will direct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| They have screening guidelines that they'll have to give to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| and I think it's used on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Is that right, Vice Mayor Saunders, in that scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| I would ask Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| There's landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| The Evergreen Trees Council is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| and they give you the spacing and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| We might ask Ms. Brooks to address that from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| If you would give us your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| I'm Amy Brooks representing the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| They'll have to come back in for a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| and we'll look at their landscaping plan at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| I see Mr. Dewhurst is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| I know you have some property in adjacent areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Would you like to come down and address Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| With Council's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Vice Mayor Saunders, how much time do I have on the rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| We've got to keep it interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Mr. Dewhurst, if you would please identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Mr. Vice Mayor, just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| This particular item, I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| is regarding to the sector plan amendment as opposed to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| So we may be moving into J, and I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Actually, both Mr. Seymour and Mr. Piper signed up to speak on J as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Dewhurst, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Mr. Frost, you want to jump in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| These are all intertwined with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| If, you know, each one has to pass in order to be effective, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| and Mr. Seymour or Mrs. Brooks may disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| If the first one fails, the other ones may become moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Now, Mr. Dewhurst, if you would identify yourself, please, and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| You've got up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| My name is David Dewhurst, 123 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Gosh, I hate to be referred to as opposition in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| I've known Joel for a long time and consider him a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| I sort of hate to be here and talk in any sort of negative capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| And, you know, actually tonight I'm very sympathetic to what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| I was very concerned about adding additional industrial zoning in the midst of our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| I think that's sort of very understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| C-4 zoning is arterial and heavy motor vehicle use highway zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| which also seems completely anathema to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| However, it's a means to an end for Mr. Piper, and I can appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| if I could get past the part about the fact that the zoning runs with the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| instead of running with the current use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Nevertheless, I'm really here tonight after speaking and spending some time at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| where we addressed this to talk directly, I think, to two different aspects of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| One is I think it was brought up just a moment ago about the barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| And at MPC they did pass this 7 to 6 by saying, including in the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| talking about having a landscape barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| One point, and it said that at MPC they said the landscape barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| and an opaque fence that would be behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| In the motion it said or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| And I think that's sort of an important distinction because, as it was also pointed out by Mr. Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| who made the motion, that evergreen landscaping, when you plant a lila in Cyprus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| especially in a location out on a city street like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| it's not long before they die and don't get kept up too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| I believe that his motion actually intended for there to be both the opaque screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| and the landscape fence, which may be a small distinction but important, I think, in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| And so I'd certainly like you to consider that as you consider whatever motions lie before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| The second item is one where, according to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3946)|
| 1:05:55| probably the main reason they want to get this done is to replace the outdoor storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| they currently have on the corner of Depot and Morgan and replace that with a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| And I certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| And my concern is that what I think happens here, because I have developed a number of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| certainly, buildings and parking lots in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| I know the incredible difficulty there is today in transforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| and meeting all the new regulations when it comes to parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| And my fear is that you may pass zoning tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| which gives them the ability to have outdoor storage on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| And Mr. Piper, who has not developed a parking lot in the city that I know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| will come to find out how unbelievably expensive and problematic it is to put this parking line in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| And he may find out that perhaps that's not in his best interest after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| And we end up with no parking lot on the corner, no removal of the outdoor storage on that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| and all of a sudden another enhanced area of downtown that is screened opaquely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| and we've got outdoor storage on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| So I'd really like you all to consider asking Mr. Piper to go approach the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4024)|
| 1:07:14| before he gets his zoning changed and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| here's all the issues I have to do in order to actually get a parking lot permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| And when he is able to kind of produce a permit, I think at that point he will have a full appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| of the economic impact to their company's wallet for what it takes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| At that point, if they're still willing to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| I'm all on board for these folks to expand their business operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| I just don't want to see happen, which I've seen happen numerous cases in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| where we start with the intention and the stated goal of we have to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| because we need the parking lot over on that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| and the parking lot on the corner never materializes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| I have faith and confidence in them, but I'm also a child of what I think Ronald Reagan said a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| trust but verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| And if they'll, you know, to me, for me to be satisfied with adding arterial highway zoning into our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4088)|
| 1:08:20| let's really examine what it's going to cost to put in these parking spaces in this corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| And if they're on board to do that, well, I'm on board to be a good neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| and be supportive and happy for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| That's going to be a tough task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| You have one minute, Mr. Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| That's what I wanted to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| I like these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| I bought property from these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| I appreciate their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| I want to see them grow and expand and succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| Outdoor storage is not really compatible with a mixed-use downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| Their business is compatible with downtown, and I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| I want to see them expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| But I also want to see them actually do what they say they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| which is the primary reason that they're up here asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| That's what I'm asking for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Thank you, Mr. Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Mr. Piper, do you have other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I didn't know if Mr. Piper wanted to respond to some of those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Well, we would disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| We don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| I've been working on this since November 22nd, so it's been a pretty long and drawn-out thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| You know, we have told you all that we want to do the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| I have done a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| I just did a, I think it was around 25,000-square-foot parking lot in the city, and it is a pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| And we know the cost involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| We have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| David doesn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| But we're prepared to push through that because we know that an improvement on that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| is an improvement for our business and it's an improvement for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| And we're asking you to meet us halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| We're going to do all the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| We're just saying let's join together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Let's collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Let's bring the public sector and the private sector together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| and let's make an improvement to this area of depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| And that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| And we can't move that material without a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| So, you know, it's kind of a chicken or the egg kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| So I wasn't going to get into everything, but, you know, the reason we're here was C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| They didn't like I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Now they don't like C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| So, you know, we're just trying to work through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| We've been a good corporate citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| You have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| That's really all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Does anybody have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| There's no commercial zone that would allow outside storage other than C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| You would have to go to an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Well, you know, I think I know how this is going to go after the vote a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| but, you know, I still have concerns about outdoor storage, but I'd be interested in other people's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| I've been waiting patiently and quietly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| It's my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| I'll start taking the reins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Can I have Ms. Brooks verify for us the information about the screening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| There was a lot of discussion at MPC about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| So the applicant will have to submit a plan, and it will get approved as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| There was discussion at the MPC meeting about the height of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| The code restricts it to a certain height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| I do agree from watching it and talking to MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| I believe, as Mr. Dewhurst said, the intent is for fence and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| Are those both required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| What are the requirements actually laid down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you for asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| And this gives me an opportunity to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| So under the C-4 zoning, it says that open storage uses must comply to the following provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| So any storage or display of merchandise and equipment shall be screened by adequate ornamental fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| and evergreen planting at the side and rear of the lot on which said open storage or display occurs provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| However, that screening shall be required in excess of seven feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| So that's the way the code currently reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| At the planning commission meeting, they went a step further and said that they conditioned it on landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4330)|
| 1:12:19| and in other physical barriers so that the intent was for it to come back to MPC for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| But either way, if you go with the MPC recommendation with the condition of landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| and additional physical barrier, or if you go with what's currently written in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| if you follow what's currently written in the code, it would go to plans and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| The planning commission just went a step further with the additional condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| And they also gave it conditions for multiple sides, not just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| Did they say three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| They said four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Freshman memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Four sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Four sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Then also to clarify, this might be a question for Mr. Ahrens, is how are these things enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| And does it also run with the land like a rezoning of C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| Did these conditions also run with the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Or there are use on review depending on who comes forth if, for instance, the property were to sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4391)|
| 1:13:21| Peter Ahrens, director of plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| I'm not sure if it runs with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| I know that the screening is only related to outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| If you've got another use on there, if you're just going strictly out of the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| screening would not be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| That screening is specific to that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| So I'm not sure where we're going as far as a simple rezoning to C-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| or C-4 with the conditions that MPC requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Given that they are going to go, if they were to go forward with the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| and go forward and get their landscaping approved, how would that be enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| How do we know it's going to happen, not just good faith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| Not just trust, verify, how is it going to get enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| We're actually building a great relationship with MPC and getting those landscape plans in our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| so that we ensure that we are not only enforcing the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| but also any additional requirements stipulated by the landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4467)|
| 1:14:35| So we've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| So the building department enforces that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| The building department does the enforcing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| We enforce it on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| If the landscaping is not there when construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| in a typical building construction, we don't hold up the CO on landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| But we found that most times when we do review for a specific landscape plan, that is indeed installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| And so we found good results with capturing it on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| And if the landscaping were to later die so it wasn't in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| you can complain to the zoning coordinator and it can get triggered for enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| And then just really quickly, a question for Mr. Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| Where is the 25,000-foot parking lot that you developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| It's on Greenway Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| So a large parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| It's fairly large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| I will say in conjunction with what Mr. Dewhurst said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| there have been some recent constituents of mine talking to me about small parcels in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| And the hoops to jump through to make a parking lot on a small parcel are incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| And sometimes it's just a matter of the size of the lot makes it a really big impediment to get the parking approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4550)|
| 1:15:58| So I understand where he's coming from on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| I don't know the lot dimensions of the current lot, but I will say I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| That is a concern that somehow the engineering will come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| and say that it's not eligible for this, that, or the other because of the length of the lot and the dimensions of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| So it's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| I guess my concern is to make sure that if we go through and we approve all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4579)|
| 1:16:26| that things do improve and they do become more harmonious and everybody lives happily ever after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| We're lovers, not fighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| Thank you, Ms. Rutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| And thank you, Mr. Dewhurst, for your comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| Having met with Mr. Piper and Mr. Frazier and them going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| and they I think have already jumped through several hoops to get us to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| and also to satisfy the concerns of MPC, I'm new at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| In a sense, it does kind of feel like we're questioning the integrity of a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| that's been in our community for over 30 to 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| I know that this business and this family has a deep commitment to our community and to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| and also has the financial means to be able to complete any plans that they present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| I also trust that MPC will definitely encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| and actually give them the planning that is necessary to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| I don't know if you guys saw the new Sentinel this week where there was actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| last week there was actually a huge article about kitchen galleries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| and how those displays and those design galleries are really the new thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| and I think it's going to be an added benefit to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| So I see this parking area as something that is not only good for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| but good for their business as it is looking to grow and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| Also, you guys know if you've ever been to Knoxville Salvage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| and you have bought anything there, you know that parking has always been an issue for this company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| so I see that parking is nothing but an added benefit to your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| and so I am in full support of moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| I am also of the opinion of the Trust and Verify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| but I also feel like if there is a business that has been this rooted in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| and in our city for so long that they would be good stewards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| and would do what they say that they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| I just want to start off by thanking Knoxville Salvage and Joel Piper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| for the years of business they've conducted on Depot Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| I'd also like to thank you for the tour you gave me before our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| and your commitment to improve the current aesthetics of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| Ultimately, I want Knoxville Salvage to be successful and to allow their business to evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| which we spoke at length and we've talked about it at length in council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| As the market changes and as also the land use around you changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| I continue to have similar concerns that I had last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| and what I'd like to start off with that I think will help this debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| is to address the enhancements that were mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| Just as a reminder for everyone tuning in at home and then also here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| the central streetscape project is a $6.15 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| That is less than 100 feet away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| There's also the White Lily project, which has been completed, which was a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| The Mews is in its second phase, which is a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| and the Regas property is under construction, which is a TIF as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| If you go back and look at what is being proposed in the streetscape project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| this is a significant investment by way of central to increase pedestrian activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4799)|
| 1:20:07| landscaping, amenities like benches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| All of this is to encourage pedestrian progress in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| And again, this is 100 feet away from this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| I'm not sure that open storage is consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| The second thing I think would help to address in this particular debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| are the conditions that MPC put on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| And I really do appreciate MPC having a thorough debate on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| It was definitely helpful, I think, for this body in making our review here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| The specific language is landscaping or some type of physical barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| be constructed along all four sides with appropriate design materials based on staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| And Ms. Brooks, I had a couple questions for you if you had a moment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| Have you been presented with any plans that would address this condition about landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4874)|
| 1:21:22| or some type of physical barrier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| No, not at this point, not beyond what you have in your own packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Can you give us some clarification on what the definition of some type of physical barrier is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4889)|
| 1:21:40| Well, we realize that the recommendation was open to interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| but I think it was the intent of the commission to send it back to have that conversation happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| with staff and the applicant with the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| And then do you have any thoughts on what appropriate means in this context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| I think based on previous recommendations that we've made, we have something called a type B screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4925)|
| 1:22:14| which is typically what staff might recommend between residential uses and commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| So it would be some type of evergreen, but we'd also encourage low bushes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| as well as other types of trees looking to guidance from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| in terms of the landscape recommendations that they've made through Casey Krause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| And then what about appropriate design materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Again, that would be part of the conversation between staff and the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| I think part of the concern that I have here is that these terms are very vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| and does not give a lot of guidance to Mr. Piper in making these improvements that he's wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| And certainly taking into consideration the comments that Mr. Dewhurst had made earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4988)|
| 1:23:17| I'd just like to ask Councilperson McKenzie if you'd be willing to consider a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| to postpone this until the owner can bring a presentation that we can look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5003)|
| 1:23:32| and has gone through appropriate channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| It is very vague, and I think for me I have a difficult time voting on something that's so vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5015)|
| 1:23:44| and not knowing exactly what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| I think it would do everyone good to go back and maybe pull a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| like was discussed about the parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| but then also submit some plans for us so we could do a thorough review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| before we go ahead and change the C-4 because this does run with the land, not with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5041)|
| 1:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| So are we saying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| So Mr. Piper, so these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| What we've done is we've hired Michael Brady to provide some renderings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| but we haven't had him do a full landscape plan because until we got the proper zoning to move the material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| we didn't want to incur the expenses of having a full-blown landscaping plan and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| We have hired their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| I think there's some renderings in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| I don't know if there's the letter in there where we procured their services, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| But we have hired them, and we're going to work with Michael Brady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| to comply with whatever the MPC requires for the landscape screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| We're going to do all those things, but we want to get to a point to where we can start making those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| And, you know, just to keep getting put off, I'm not really, you know, you all have to make the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| but for me personally and I think for our company, we would like to get back to running our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| You know, it's just this is a part that we do because we want to grow our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| but it also is a part that we're not really getting anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| We're just spending more time evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| So that's kind of where we're at as a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| Excuse me, we have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Ms. Singh-Perez, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Hi, Mr. Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Hi, how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| As things are right now, if you don't get the change in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| what will be required for you to do with the business as it is right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Well, if we don't get the change in zoning at 115, there's no impetus to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| We have an I-3 zoning at the corner of Morgan and Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| and that's where the lumber will have to sit because we have nowhere else to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| We sold lays to Randy Boyd, much to the delight of several developers downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| They begged us to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| And now we're consolidating, and then we're getting somewhat some distress over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| but we're having to consolidate, and that's just the nature of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| And so we're trying to get to that point of consolidating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| We want to have responsible growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| We're going from a 4,000-square-foot space to 21,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| I mean, if you deal with any kind of building material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| you know you'd rather use the 21,000 over the 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| So we felt like I feel passionate this is a win-win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| The city gets an improved street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| We get to use a bigger parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| We do all those things that we say we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| I know I've had several people contact all the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| and I think they've spoken and given us a character reference to say we'll do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| We don't know what they are because MPC, we've not sat down and said exactly what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| We just know we have to do landscape screening, and we're able to do all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| I mean, we just haven't been told exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| So as things are right now, what type of landscape screening do you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| if you just leave it at this and describe what it looks like at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| I don't think we have anything that we're required to do at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| We don't have anything to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| We're operating on an I-3 on the corner, and it'll just have to stay on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| It would remain with the big piles on the corner where the potential parking lot could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| There's no screening. There's no Leland, Cypress, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| So we can have this, or we can have trust and verification in what you may do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| That's the way I would say it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| So we can have this mess 100 feet away from the streetscape and the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| or we can try to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Mr. McKenzie, do you still have something to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you, Van Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Well, I'm not interested in postponing this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| I think this is MPC's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| We pass zonings all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| The use on review is our safety net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| and we're trusting MPC to review those plans and to put them in according to their standards that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| And those landscape plans don't come back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| That's what MPC's role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| And we approve plans on a regular basis based on the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| That's our safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| That's going above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| We don't normally get use on review on C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| And that's a concession that they've made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| and I fully support and fully depend on MPC to make sure that the plans are to the specifications that is required in your guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5323)|
| 1:28:54| So I'm not interested in postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| I think this is a fair and equitable deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| and I think that Mr. Piper and Mr. Frazier have shown great restraint and great compromise in trying to get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5340)|
| 1:29:09| and I think it's time to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| It's not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| It's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| George covered some of my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| George covered some of my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| I don't feel that that's our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| You know, we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| We either vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I listened to MPC and how they voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| They voted 13-0 in favor of the sector plan because they all were in agreement that industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| even though it's allowed in the sector plan, didn't seem to fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| and then they were kind of split but voted in favor of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| So I would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| We sent it back to them with those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| And if for any reason the use on review is somehow dissatisfactory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| and fails to meet someone's satisfaction, it can be appealed to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| So those are the processes for that, and I agree with George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| I think we have hit all the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Peter, I think you wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Yeah, I just wanted to make a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| If we go with the C-4 out of the code, the screening is tied to the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| so that it's only screened when you've got outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| If you go with the MPC recommendation, that's tied to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| so that those buffer strips are there permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| And I'm not sure if a storage yard is long-term or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| but if different development happens in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| that land is essentially lost unless it goes back through a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| The point of clarification is the screening is tied to the use in C-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| but tied to the land through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Well, we've had a pretty vigorous discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Mr. Ahrens, so if at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| and I know that this family seems to be in it for the long haul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| but let's say in the next 40, 50 years, if they were to sell that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| and the new owners decided that they were not going to be in the same type of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| would the barriers be able to be taken down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| No, not without going through another public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| They could, but it has to go through a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| So the answer is, yes, it's possible, but it would just have to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5497)|

| 1:31:40| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5500)|

| 1:35:45| Arthur Seymour and Sam Giovanni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| Mr. Giovanni and I are here in support of the MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| which is neighborhood commercial and C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| We would be happy to answer any questions you all might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5760)|

| 1:36:15| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| My question may be more for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| How long has this been operating as a grocery store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| There's some debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Probably since at least the early part of the 20th century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| maybe the 1890s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| And I guess the staff recommended to deny this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| because it was spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Anyway, I was just sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| They voted to deny C3 zoning, not C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| Okay, but this was on the sector plan, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| It said deny the request of GC, general commercial sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| So I guess can you explain why this grocery store that's been there for decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| and I guess why is it spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| or why wasn't it zoned commercial earlier in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| That's not something that staff knows at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| It was probably an oversight years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| because it has been operating as a neighborhood-serving commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| It was probably just oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| I mean, I plan on supporting all these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| but I think when you start to look at the code and spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| and if you want mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| well, that implies there's going to be different uses sort of in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| So anyway, I think it's one of the challenges that I hope the recode addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| But anyway, it's just sort of interesting that it was approved humanely by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| but the staff had voted to deny it because it breaks the rules of spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| even though it's been there for operating as some type of small grocery store for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5896)|

| 1:39:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| My name is Dan Mitchell, owner of EGLE CDI, the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Address is 11719 Chapman Highway, Seymour, Tennessee, 37865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| I would like to request that this particular vote be postponed for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| giving the owner an opportunity to review the actual layout that we have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| and that we have right now conditional use on review with the city side of this particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| We're finding out right now that based upon the county has approved us for the subdivision that we'd like to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| this particular property is located on the northeast side of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| It is surrounded currently by neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| and we designed and developed a particular plan that meets the county requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| but what we're finding out is there is some additional overburdensome requirements the city now is being put on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| in reference to this particular property that's going to make it cost prohibitive to be able to design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| and build houses that would meet the market demand for that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| and then also the price point that the current homes are being sold at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| So we need to have an opportunity to postpone this, to bring this to the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| and before we change this from an agricultural sitting in the middle of the city and to an RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| we have to have the owner's approval on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| At this particular moment, we do not see the viability or the feasibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| based upon the city restrictions that are now being put on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| to allow a residential neighborhood as exactly what's already there in the neighborhood to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6066)|
| 1:41:13| So our concern is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| Ms. Singh Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| Have you been working with engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| What was it called, the AASH law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| AASHTO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| So what we have met with city engineering, and they pointed out a few items that they've adopted just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| We are the first plan that's actually been submitted that's under this new AASHTO requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| that relates to having a minimum of a 300-foot sight line as somebody's backing out of their driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| With this particular neighborhood, nobody has a 300-foot sight line that's down around the surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| but they're requiring this particular new property to be able to meet that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| Subsequently, we had it originally designed to have 55 lots within the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| reduced it down to 48 lots, and then reduced it down again to 42 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| that we thought that that would make it viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| Unfortunately, now with this AASHTO requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| there would be no way that we could possibly get those type of sight lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| which the topography of the land, which this is kind of a sloping terrain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| subsequently us being able to design not only to incorporate the sidewalk requirements that they're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| but also, too, to be able to put the lots in subsequent areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| This property may never get developed based upon those new restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| It's an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| This is the best use for the property in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| and the other homes that are inside that particular group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| we would be matching, if not exceeding, some of the requirements that even meets the current neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| Along with additional restrictions that they're putting on us by forcing us to improve a long portion of the Ferd Hickey Roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| and installing sidewalks, curbs, and gutters on a section that goes nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| There's no additional sidewalks that are even tying this into anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| and it's crazy the burden that we're being put under to be able to develop a small property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| to provide affordable housing in that particular market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| I think that it will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| It will just be developed with fewer houses, and those roads are pretty small and winding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| And then Piney Grove Church Road I know goes out to Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| But I understand your hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Well, the idea that you talk about fewer housing, you're talking about property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| And then if the individual lot costs right now, based upon the market price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| in essence between $35,000 and $45,000, that means that the lots, if we reduce them any more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| we go up to $80,000 to $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| Current price point in those neighborhoods are around $200,000 to $250,000 for those particular homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| It would make it impossible for anything to be developed that anybody could build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| just based upon the sheer lot costs and the development costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| Duplexes or apartments are also an option, something that's affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| We've looked at that on both avenues in the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| but the road restrictions that they require for the parking requirements on the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| the same back and sightline requirements, even if we went to a high-density type development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| it doesn't seem like it's going to be feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| We're evaluating all the options that could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| However, the zoning back to an RP1 might not be the direct zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| So right now keeping it as an A1 until we can have further commentary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| not only submitting of additional plans and our owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| They may want to keep it as an A1 before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| Well, of course, a postponement is no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| Move to postpone it 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6276)|

| 1:44:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6283)|

| 1:44:45| Substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| So this is a priority motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| So this takes priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6288)|

| 1:49:14| Pond Gap is proud to have a diverse past and a diverse present and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| hopefully a diverse future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| And these baseball games brought the community together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| It was quite common to have mixed audiences watching the games during a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| picnic lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| There was some really good baseball that was played there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| A lot of the teams were mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| Some were all black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Some were all white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| And some really good talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| We've had some preliminary discussions with the city, Mr. King, to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| Most of the property is UT's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| We're in discussions with the representative there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| What I want to do tonight is show you an artist's rendering of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| We're very soon to make our case before UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| Hopefully they'll let us have the property or just give it to us or have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| some way the city take control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| So without further ado, I'm going to release this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| See Pond Gap, Main Street, Civil Rights Baseball Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6606)|
| 1:50:12| And Michael Kearney, an architect at Weeks, Ambrose, and McDonald did this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| I'll just pan around real slow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6619)|
| 1:50:32| This would involve metal baseball figures, probably six feet tall by three feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| We'd have, like, a catcher, a batter, an umpire, a pitcher, outfielders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| We also would honor Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| There's a great photograph where they're coming off the field shaking hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| and this would be perfect for a couple of baseball figures hand-in-hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| To get a sample of what we want to do, if you go on Hill Avenue across from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| James White Fort, you'll see some adults and children and birds and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| that an artist did like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| Thank you for your time, and I'll keep everyone up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Next, David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| David, if you would come to the mic and give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| David Hayes, 1213 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| Just some initial thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| First off, about the police headquarters, the potential of that moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| just come out to say I am staunchly against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| I join many in the community who are staunchly against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| I was shocked and surprised to see at the State of the City address that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| current safety building, which is ironically named, the current safety building is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| moving from a spot that is on, like, the fossils of a thriving black community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| before it's pushed out and being moved into another historically black community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| in Knox College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| I think the last thing McCanns will need is more policing and criminalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| Everything else is going to be about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| So there's a chant that you will hear if you go to a lot of rallies and marches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| You'll hear the chant saying, this is what democracy looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| The people gathering, the people voicing their opinions and concerns and demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| and organizing is what democracy looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| This budgeting process is not what democracy looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| If the mayor was here, I would look her in the face and be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| I would be kind of embarrassed, especially after being this progressive mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| after so many years and we're still seeing how our budgets still do not reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| the best interest of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| Our budgets are still not made in a way that's participatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| in a way that a community can actually engage in a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| And just having a couple meetings isn't actually real engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| When I say engagement, I mean actually people having the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| to actually say what programs are funded and how money is allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| and there being a public process for that to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| Other cities across not only the country but the world are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| And if we really want to be a progressive city, this would be something we would practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| So just to go ahead and make that point, I wanted to point out how much police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| and criminalization, how much money they are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| versus the social services offered by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| So the police is getting about over $93 million total, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| Like 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| This is almost $100 million going to policing and criminalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| and creating institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| And somebody even offered, even talked about giving them a raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| as if we need more police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| I think that's outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| So that's what they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| So $93 million is what they're getting and they have 519 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| So let's talk about how that compares to social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| First up, we'll go with parks and recs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Park and recreation, you all know, like they have over community centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| and greenways and public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| I'm going to give people a chance to assemble and give youth activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| and all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| $23 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| So that's $70 million less than criminalizing and policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| And they only have 43 employees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| That's 519 compared to 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| It's like a community development, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| We like to, as Knoxville, tout how much we care about the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| how much our mayor is doing and how much the city is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| for community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| It's like for affordable housing and homelessness programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| and all the things that the Community Development Office does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| They're getting about $14 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| So that's $79 million less than policing and criminalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| The administration, so in the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| you have the Office of Sustainability, the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| park, which I think park deserves actual teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| and the ability to actually effect a policy to police and hire and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| and not just be a symbolic board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| But nonetheless, that's in the mayor's office, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| and a few more offices that provide some services for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| That's allocated about $8 million, just over $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| So that's an $85 million difference of criminalizing and policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| and the services that our mayor's office provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| The community agency grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| So one thing that the mayor likes to do is send out these grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| to all these different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| I think I have them outlined as arts, culture, social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| and community groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| One of our, I know various people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| who are part of nonprofits who get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| You have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| So the total money allocated to these is just over $1 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| So this money going directly to communities and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| in our neighborhoods and our communities are actually doing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| to help the people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| They're getting more than $91 less than police, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| And then we'll go to Community Action Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| a social service organization, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| They're not even getting a million dollars allocated in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| Over $92 million difference between them and policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| So we need a shift, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| So we need a shift to focusing on root causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| and the reimagining safety to really create a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| that our folks need and a community that doesn't have as many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| doesn't have as many cops, isn't trying to raise cops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| is actually trying to have other institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| and other things our community needs to better themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| And I hope that going forward into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| especially next year, you look at how you can partner with the community more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| how you can work with people more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| have different processes where people can communicate and participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| so we don't see such a disconnect between the interests of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| and the interests of those in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Mr. Hayes, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| I'd just like to respond to Mr. Hayes for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| I'd just like to respond to him for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180508?start=7007)|
