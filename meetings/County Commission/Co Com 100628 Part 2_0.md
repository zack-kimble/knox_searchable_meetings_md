| 0:09:39| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Hey, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Over here just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| We've got another hot issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Would you ask those with Covenant to stand up, please, so we can know what's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| And with the Parker family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Here they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| We might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Give me a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| My wife is a registered nurse with Fort Sanders Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Her supervisor happens to be under the umbrella of the Park West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| So, abundance of caution, I am going to recuse myself any discussion or vote on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I just wanted to make a disclosure, is that I'm on the Board of Directors of the Mercy Health System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| which is in competition with the Covenant system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| However, I'm going to speak for what Covenant is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| If someone has opposition to that, quite frankly, if this goes through, it could financially hurt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| But I still want to support it because I think that it's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| I had a colonoscopy at Park West, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| I'm going to make a motion that we approve per MPC recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Well, MPC didn't recommend this, though, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Too many details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I'll make a motion we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| We are asking for OB zoning without conditions, and Mr. Lassner is prepared to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| That will be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| We have a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Could you restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| My motion was to, I have had correspondence and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Would you restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Because that's going to be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I want to make sure it's worded correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| To approve OB zoning without any restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| It's been properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Commissioner Groves, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| There's a light on for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| We're voting right now to approve this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| Without any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| No one had any lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Oh, I thought you were asking for opposition from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| No one stood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| I didn't get that clear that it was time for us to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| So I would like to, I'd like to offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| And the motion being to accept the recommendations of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Died for a lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| We're back on the original motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| Do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| And I didn't want to necessarily second that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| but I would like to hear from MPC as to what those two conditions were and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Can I second it just so that we can have a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| He's already declared it dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| But I don't think I'm out of order at this point to hear from MPC if I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| We're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| So could I hear from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| After receiving a recommendation from staff for planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| and hearing from the applicant that their contract for purchase required OB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| the planning commission recommended that you approve OB zoning with two conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| one of which is that there would be no clearing and grading on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| until a development plan was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| and the second is that a development plan be approved using the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=834)|
| 0:14:04| So I guess at this point I would like to hear from Attorney Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| as to why those are too restrictive to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| If I may at this point, I would like to turn it over to Mr. Lassiter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| who is the administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| I really would just like a pretty simple answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| I mean, personally, I would just like a simple answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Commissioner, the property involved is a little over 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| Park West Hospital is out of property at its site out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| They have a plan or a vision, probably a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| to develop an addition to the hospital, further medical office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| and medical facilities on this 30-acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| That will occur over the next 10, 15, 20, perhaps even 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=893)|
| 0:15:02| During that period of time, if the condition that we come back for use on review is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| we will have to come back for multiple approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| We could do a master plan now, but the way the hospital industry is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| that would require multiple revisions, multiple approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| They are already subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| The hospital industry is as regulated, as you know, as any industry around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| Medical practices are changing dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| Park West does not know where it will be in the next 10, 15, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| This is the zone we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| The newest hospital in town was developed under St. Mary's North on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| Every other hospital in town is in a zone that allows hospital uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| but does not require multiple plan approvals from the planning authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| This is no slam at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| It is just working out the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| We cannot grade there now without approval of Knox County Engineering and will not, of course, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:23| Before an addition to a hospital can be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| Park West will have to go to the Health Facilities Commission in Nashville, which has approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen on developing a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| and that's the reason we respectfully ask that that condition be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| I don't have a problem with the second condition, but I do have a problem with the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| especially since we've been doing so much work, Tony's committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| and we've learned a lot more about the dangers of grading and clearing a site before you have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| So I really don't feel like I can support this unless we have some kind of assurance that that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:16| I mean, I think MPC was right on in making that a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| May I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Knox County enacted, and I'm going to say in 2008, pursuant to its agreement with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| a stormwater and street ordinance, which is approved, and I don't see anybody from engineering over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| but after a lot of discussion, it is fully in compliance with the ARAP, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| the other permits required by the state of Tennessee, TDEC and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| It's been designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| We cannot turn a spade of dirt out there without a permit from Knox County Engineering and, of course, will not do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:07| So can I ask why MPC had a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| Within the Northwest County Sector Plan, this property is identified for slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| and the plan makes the recommendation when properties are identified for slope protection that you use a planned zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:32| The property is surrounded on three sides by planned commercial zoning already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| and part of the property is already zoned planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| so those are the two reasons why we, as staff, recommended planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:47| The Planning Commission tried to get to the same end result of development plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| but doing it with OB as the base zone with the conditions of plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| and no clearing and grading before that plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| So I'm going to let some other people ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| I want to think about that just a few more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Arthur, when we talked, you said that you would provide me or provide us an example of how the process is so difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:31| or the reason for your opposition mainly, and as you think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| I just wanted to say a couple of things in preface to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| In terms of hillsides and the effort of the ridgetop, steep slope folks, the task force, our main focus is ridge lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:50| and we would probably go out there as you go into Cedar Bluff and you look at this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| and you'll go, well, it's not a ridge line, and therefore it might not be significant in terms of the types of efforts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:07| But then, again, if I'm somebody that lives in Cedar Bluff and I understand the value of steep slopes and hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:21| and how they function, and I might say, well, because of the fact that this is an isolated hillside surrounded by development completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:34| does that make it insignificant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| It might make it more significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| It just depends on your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| I think that it would be, I appreciate greatly the work of the staff, of MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:50| and their expertise in urban planning and the fact that they are saying we need to stay with the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:59| that approval processes are in place for a reason, and indeed that the planning commission also agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:09| And so we have two bodies that are intimately involved with this property, understand its implications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| and have said that we think this is the way to go with reservation, OB with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And so I want to remind my colleagues here about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| I know we're probably, and I tend to be this way also, I'm quick to defer to the district, to my district mates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| and to their decisions about their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| But I'm also trying to be concerned about our set of standards and rules that we have in place for making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:52| And so that's what concerns me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| I think that Park West will eventually develop this area and maybe not in the way I personally would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1315)|
| 0:22:05| and retain some of the steep slopes and retain some of that forested area, at least on one side of that hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| but that's for them to decide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| But would you give me that, do you recall the example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| and my question was how in the past was Park West inhibited in a similar process where they did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:32| where they had to go through use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| I want to know some examples of, well, these multiple, as far as I can tell, they've only got to go back twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| It's a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| It's not a multiple-step process as you describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| But you go ahead and correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| And I may turn it over to Rick Laster in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| This property, the 30 acres we're talking about, is a little different than the hospital itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| The hospital was rebuilt, Rick, four years ago, five years ago, basically on the same site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| There was a new medical office building that was improved sometime about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| Those were one-shot things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| This 30 acres will not be a hospital, all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| It will not be a medical office building, all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| I might, if I may, let Rick Laster respond to how they see this property developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:36| I need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Hello, Rick Laster from Park West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Thanks for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| And your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| And your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| 522 Cumberland Ridge, Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| We're really not talking about the past here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| We're talking about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| We're looking at 10, 15, 20 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| And as we stand today, I'm not sure our board would approve the significant expenditure of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| that we've got to put out on this property in order to go forward and look at what we're going to do over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| There are changes in health care every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| We're looking at buying a piece of property that makes the future of Park West 15, 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| And with our current medical staff growth, our patient visitors growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| the patients I see every day that have trouble parking at Park West and getting out and off the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| it's time for us to start planning that expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| And we need to be assured that we can build whatever we need to build 5, 10, 15 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| So it's really about looking more to the future than it is to the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| My question still remains, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Arthur, you gave me some assurance that you'd give an example of some past example of where this was the type of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:59| And this is why financially the hospital feels compelled to move forward and press for no restrictions on OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:10| I'll try to respond directly using this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Unlike the rebuilding of Park West Hospital, this property does not have a master plan at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| The reason Park West wants to buy this property is it is the last available tract of property that is contiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| or at least right across the street from it that it can use for future expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| In planning that future expansion, which Park West feels will occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| it needs to have the assurance that within the confines of the OB zone, it can develop this hospital as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| Hospitals, and Rick may want to add something to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| hospitals not only would have to comply with the zoning ordinance that regulates OB setbacks, items like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| they would have to comply with what the Knox County Engineering Department would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| And I think you all have as strict a stormwater and street ordinance as any municipality around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| It's at least as strict as the city of Knoxville, if I recall the details right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| They would have to go to the Health Facilities Commission in Nashville for approval of any future hospital expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| That commission also dictates to a certain extent, and Rick can respond a little better than me, how you do a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:41| Medicare, which is one of the big payers, medical payers now, has a say in how you do a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:53| We might be able to take a plan down to MPC tomorrow and say we're going to put a hospital here and a medical office building over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| Well, what if the Health Facilities Commission says you can only put half of that there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Well, then we go back, and that's what, a six-month, eight-month process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Two years. I'm being conservative there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| Two years to get a new hospital facility approved or in addition to an existing hospital facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Then you have to go back for another use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| All right, you decide that you want to put in a surgery center separate and apart from your hospital or a diagnostic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| That's another approval that has to go through Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Then you have to go back and get it approved locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| You may or may not get it approved in Nashville because, as Dr. Briggs has indicated already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| hospitals sometimes fight over capacity in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| It's another layer, and I don't call MPC bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| They do their job and do it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| But it's another layer of approval that Covenant does not feel it should have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| because no other hospital in town is in a planned zone at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| No other hospital except Park West was built in a planned zone, and that was a rebuilding of an existing hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| When they built the original Park West back in the 70s, I doubt if there was much local oversight over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| because we all thought it was in Lenore City when they built it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| and didn't understand how they could make a go of it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| But they have, and they just came back and rebuilt it recently, rebuilt the medical office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| We think it is in the best interest, Covenant does, and their board thinks they can do the right thing, as they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:59| As Mr. Spezia pointed out in his letter to you all, Covenant Health, in the past ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| has spent $750 million in hard construction costs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| That's a new hospital in Sevierville, a new hospital in Lenore City, expansion at Oak Ridge Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| a major addition, which is ongoing at this time, to Fort Sanders on Clinch Avenue and other miscellaneous projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:29| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Seymour. You answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And I just have one other thing, I guess, here for Mr. Lasseter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| And I don't want to, you know, this is somewhat, we've identified this type of thing as an environmentally sensitive area to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:48| Our community agrees with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| When we go out and do our task force thing, vast majority of people in this county agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| Steep slopes, forested areas, they're steep slopes, they're sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| Okay. You're going to take this down and you're going to make a parking lot out of most of the area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| That's your first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| No, sir. Our immediate need is parking, but it's not to take that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| Okay. All right. But you're going to take some of it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| Now, one of the things that we would also be concerned with would be that environmental issue of the hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| and then also I'm wondering, have you made plans for, what are the plans for the removal, the waste, this overburden that you're getting rid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:36| Have you made plans for that? Where does that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| And what happens with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| We haven't made plans for that yet. We're looking at something that's five, ten, 15 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| Okay. So the first phase of the parking lot will be five years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| No, sir. The parking lot is something we need to do pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Okay. So you anticipate that to be when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Within the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Okay. Well, I would just hope that you would be sensitive to other issues because historically in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| it seemed like a lot of things that take place in terms of cuts or what we'd call, what's the kind of cut, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:12| where you remove soil and you take it to another place? We call that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| Commonly known as a borrow pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Okay. So borrow pits occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| I hope the borrowed material doesn't end up being another problem for us in another area that happens a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| and Knox County has in the past. So I'd appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| We are, can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| We are a so-called green hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| We focus every day on our impact on the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| We work hard to look at our carbon footprint and what we're doing to our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| and we will be very conscious of our impact on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Yeah, I just want to make a statement in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| There are certain things that are unique about the health care industry that's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| than some of the other commercial enterprises that we've run into and the problems that we've run into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| particularly with some of the storm water problems where companies have gone in either to build subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| or some sort of commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| They take the side of the hill off or they take the top of the hill off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| We run into difficult economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| They don't have the finances able to complete it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| and I think it's fair to say that the financial strength of Covenant and, I mean, to be perfectly honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| the health care industry is pretty much resistant to a lot of these economic downturns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| The jobs that the hospitals provide are high-paying jobs with good benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| They are pretty much recession-proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| The hospitals will be in business, and if you just take a tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| you don't have just to look at the Covenant hospitals and Park West hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| where really their campuses are very beautiful, but you can go to the other hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| and I think they've been very environmentally sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| They're aesthetically pleasing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| A lot of the companies that architecturally design these hospitals aren't local companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| They're companies that are contracted in to come from the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| where they're very much aware of what the hospitals look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| and I don't think we're going to run into a situation where Covenant takes off part of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| They go broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| We have mud running into neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| That's just not the situation out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| and I think to look at the health care industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| you have to look at it a little bit different than some of the other industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| that we've maybe had difficulty with in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| and I think when it's all said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I don't think we'll be unhappy with what it aesthetically looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| and as you can see here, there's really no opposition to this with any of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| First of all, there's no near neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| but even the people that live out there aren't really opposed to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| and I would encourage everyone to vote for the conditions that Commissioner Hammond mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| where we vote to approve this, but without the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Arthur, this hospital, what zoning are you wanting for this hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:30| and what zoning was St. Mary's that's close to my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| what was it zoned under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| We are asking for OB zoning just as it's set forth in the zoning ordinance without any conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| St. Mary's North on Emory Road is zoned OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Without conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Without conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Without conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Buzz, we've got two hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| They're both in a sloping area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| What's the difference between this hospital and St. Mary's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| Based on my general knowledge of the St. Mary's situation, I don't want to get into the debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| but I would think that that is a little bit different than what we have out in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| I don't recall if that sector plan indicated slope protection for that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| although I haven't had the opportunity to look at that and check the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| But that was the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| In fact, the original application that came into us was for planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| which is a zone that would require site plan review for the Cedar Bluff property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| and for what Park West is wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| So, you know, if I had a chance to look at both of them, as I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and my recall of anything that we've done at St. Mary's North,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| I think you do have two different situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Well, they look awful similar to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I mean, I believe that was zoned commercial through there before it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| Here's what I'm afraid of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| and I understand the work that Mr. Norman's committee has done on slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| And what it looks like to me is that we are almost imposing this on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| and slope protection in the form that this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| the committee has not even drafted their resolution yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| This commission has not seen what they've drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| We've seen what they would like to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| but we haven't even seen a potential ordinance yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| And we're already imposing restrictions on these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| and the way this looks to me with the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| it looks like it's going to affect about 60% of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| and it's a law that hasn't even passed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| And I'm glad this came up while I'm on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| because I probably won't be here when the slope protection ordinance actually reaches the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| But one of the unintended consequences of this is that it will restrict their growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| It will restrict the growth of Knox County just as sure as it is restricting the growth of this hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| and it hasn't even passed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| If it passes, it's not on the books now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and I don't think we should restrict these folks with what they want to do because of a law that may or may not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| But I do hope that we'll look at this, because Knox County is just like this hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| If this goes into place, it's going to restrict the growth of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| which is going to spur the growth of the surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| which is going to add to urban sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| and it's nice that we mention borrow pits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| because a good bit of the land that is in these slopes is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| And under the Right to Farm Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| MPC has very little say-so in what grading goes on on agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| if that agricultural property is being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| if that grading is being done to improve that property's use for agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| And I think we've got a lot of farmers here from out in east Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| that will tell you it's a whole lot easier to grow corn on flat ground as it is on the side of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| So I would challenge you that if there are places that need dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| and some places used for a borrow pit, this isn't going to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| What it's going to do is instead of using dirt from land where there's a commercial expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:47| like a hospital, what you're going to have is the farmer is going to realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| well, I can sell off a lot of my dirt, and in the process I can increase the size of my fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| and therefore increase the yield of my crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| I don't think we're going to stop anything if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| I think what we're going to do is we're going to change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| And I think that right now, even if this is going to pass, and I don't believe it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| I think it is severely unfair for us to put these conditions on this hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| when we didn't put those conditions on a hospital that was just recently built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| That's why I intend to vote against the substitute motion, and I intend to vote for the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| There is no substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Tony, you look like you had something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| No, I just thought Mr. Lambert's talking about an ordinance that does not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| He's talking about a plan that we are in review of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| and we are talking about something, a document that the MPC goes by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| and a judgment that they made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| That's two totally different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| Author, Mr. McAllister, this is where you want to do the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| you want to do the parking lot now, right, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| That's their immediate need, Lester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| What percentage of the area is sloped area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| If you look at the map, it's a little hard to tell because we're working off MPC maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| but it's right in the middle of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| so it takes away the opportunity to do a lot in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| Typically hospitals will, you know, parking is a first thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| then later a medical office building or a parking garage and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| I'm estimating a good third of the property, but that's a guesstimate, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| I go back to what Commissioner Briggs, what he was saying in talking about what the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| and what you all do and what you all try to do into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| You know, to me, the hospitals that we have, the Mercy System, the Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| you know, you guys are first class acts and you all do first class things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| and you do put a lot back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| And, you know, you're in competition with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| and you want that feel good feeling of the patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| that's where I want to go have surgery this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| And, you know, I have trust that you guys are going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| In my opinion, you guys are the leader in Knox County when it comes to hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| as far as with your construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| And I just, I like what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Everything you do seems to be first class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| I do, I still have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Arthur, I've heard you say that there is no plan as yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| but then you said it's going to be a hardship on them if they can't develop it according to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| I've also, you know, you're talking about that this development might happen in 20 to 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:06| So it seems to me like it's even more important that we make sure we have the right guidelines now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| because we don't know what's going to be happening in 20 or 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| And there are a lot of approvals that the hospital is subjected to, and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| but none of them have anything at all to do with slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| We've been working on this issue, the county has, for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| We've put in a lot of work, and I think it's something that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| I'm going to have a really hard time supporting this unless at least that one condition is met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:45| The second one, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| But the first one, I really, really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| I think that's, we are working on slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Is it important or is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| And you're right, Parkwest should be leading the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| especially in terms of sustainable development, a facility that large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| And if you are a green hospital, I would think that you would welcome this kind of condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:17| May I respond briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| The OB zone sets out certain requirements and uses in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| And, well, I'm starting to repeat myself and I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Knox County Engineering has a very strict stormwater and street ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| which we will have to comply with before we can turn any dirt out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| And I know that Rusty Baxa, who is the engineer, is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:47| And, frankly, until we know what zoning we can get, we do not know how to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| Is that fair, Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| And where we are today, we're not even going to put the money out for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| unless we know what we can do with the property in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| It's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I don't think our board would approve this kind of expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| not knowing that we can go and do with that property what we need to 10, 15 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| And it's not like the land is going to lie fallow for 10 or 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| They will initially use part of it for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| And then as they go forward and their needs arise, I think Parkwest Hospital is full now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| So they need to start working towards an expansion of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| There's probably a need with an expansion of the hospital for more medical office buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| maybe stand-alone surgery center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| I'm not in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| That's Rick's diagnostic center and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| So they do not anticipate that the property will be fully developed for the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:57| It will be partially developed starting immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| And I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| And I also wanted to say I appreciate all of the employees from Parkwest who have contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| I very much appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And I guess I would like to, Tony, is there anything more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| I mean, I feel like this is, I feel like slope protection is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| We've been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Are we going to do it or are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Mr. Leister and Mr. Spezia, I want to thank you for having a vision and staying in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| I know that there's, you're probably one of the largest, if not the largest, private employer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| And what you've done downtown at the fort and what you've continued to do with all your facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| I have no qualms about approving this OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| I hope that you do in your future boards continue the vision that you have of being a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| This is risky for us, but I have faith in your organization that you'll do the right thing with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| And so I have no reason to have any heartburn about supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| But I ask that you refer to or relate to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| and ask them that part of the mission of that new property be to be friendly to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| as you guys always have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| And I do appreciate you investing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Councilor Seymour, I want to make sure I've got this process in my mind straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| What you're really telling me is that we have several layers of federal oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| We have some layers of state oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Then we have our county engineering department that has oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| And then under our request from MPC, we would have MPC oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| And these would be, the use on review would be for every modification of the plan once approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| If it's a major modification or if it's a change in the plan, yes, we would have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| In terms of just, I don't know if you can speak for Mr. McAllister or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| I'd be glad to hear on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| When you get started in this, I'm kind of looking at it, you know, from things I can relate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| like if I'm building a house or if I'm, Patty Jo can change things on me in a hurry, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| and it can run my cost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| And if I had to run over to get everything approved here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| what kind of additional financial burdens would this put on projects based on your all's experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| if we had beyond local engineering approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| I'm not sure if we can put a dollar value on time, but it's primarily, I mean, the filing fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| But in the grand scheme of things, it would be a time factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| and an additional potential roadblock for what they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| And like your house, if you get a building permit, you're okay, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| even if she makes some modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| But this is a large tract of property, 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| And I could see just going over it with Mr. Edsel and the other folks, Mr. Laster and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:32| you could come back to MPC 10, 15, 20 times as the health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| the hospital industry evolves over the next five, 10, 15, 20 or 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| One other question in the financing of this, because I'm not familiar with building hospitals at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| are there any like federal dollars or federal grants that would result in any environmental assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| environmental impact statement or anything like that, or is this 100% private?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| No, it'll be a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| 100% private?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| There's a need for hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| You look around here and you see, I don't even know why they even need to come in under zoning or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| Look at the people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| We've become a nation of older people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Knox County is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| We've lost one hospital already in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| These people are business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| They're looking at the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Whether you want to realize it or not, everybody in this room is going to die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| and most of us are going to go to a hospital before we die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| Now, this needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I don't care if they're building it on top of the Smoky Mountains, if we need this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| Somewhere, this commission has got to look at common sense and forget slope protection and all this on things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Now, they don't want to build this hospital somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| They're wanting to build it where it's needed at, and that's why they're trying to add on where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| That's where the hospital needs it, and I want to commend them for even building one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| but we just lost our hospital in South Knoxville, and we're going to need another one to take up the slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| So I think we should vote without restrictions, like Commissioner Hammond said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| and like I second, and get on about other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| I was going to call for the question, but I don't see any lights on, so I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Better hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| It's not without restrictions, it's without no conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| Is everyone clear on the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3043)|

| 0:53:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| I have some questions I'd like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| First, Mr. Troyer, if you would come down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| If you would, I'm not talking about the full five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| I'm talking about next year, starting July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| What is the total amount of the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| If you look on the printed material, if you have it in front of you, it's page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| $72 million of which 58, I'm sorry, you just asked for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| First year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| First year is $17.7 million of which $12 million relate to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| So the other $5.7 million, that's for roads, other capital needs, that's other than schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| Yeah, round number, $1 million in roads, $1 million on just improvements to existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| a small amount to parks and recs, a small amount to libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| and some countywide, miscellaneous countywide improvements, including energy management improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| How are we going to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| I'm talking about the $17.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Bond proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Now, will you release bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| And, again, I'm asking because I'm not a bond person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| Will you ask for all of the bonds for the total $58 million or for the five-year plan or just for the one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| We try to go, as a rule, just once a year and try to match the spending with the borrowing to keep our interest costs as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:17| So we'll be going and asking for basically $18 million in bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| What would be the difference in asking for $18 million as opposed to $25 million in bonds for the one-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:31| Round numbers, I hate to calculate here in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| There might be another $900,000 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:45| Okay, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| I'd like to ask him a question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| If you want to ask him, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| So that would equate to about close to a penny on the tax roll, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| Round numbers, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| If you've got a real short one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| I have a real short one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Did you say $12 million of this, $17 million is going to schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| The first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Out of that $12 million, is $5 million going to Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| How is it being broken up with Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| The Carter plan is $2 million in the first year and $3 million in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| That's what you needed or you want to know the rest of the first year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I didn't have anything further for you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| And I don't know who I'm going to ask these to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| whether it's Dr. McIntyre or Ms. Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| We talked briefly this over the weekend, and quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| I was on I-40 driving to Murphy's Broadway basketball tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| not for me, but for my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| And I was trying to avoid the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| My concerns about this project, as I related to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| and Ms. Kincannon earlier in the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| was I wanted to make sure that if we're going to do a renovation out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| that we have a sound structure out there to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| Have we had an independent engineering firm come out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| and do an analysis on the foundation, the structure itself, the plumbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| the electrical, so that seven, eight, ten years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| we've got some nice additions, but the building's crumbling around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| I want to make sure that whatever we do is a long-lasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| as permanent a fix for this community as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| Have we had an independent engineering firm come out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| and take a look at that structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| Mr. Chairman, you're asking about on the Carter Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| On the Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| As part of the initial, you know, we're sort of in the conceptual design phase right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| and as part of that, the architectural firm had a structural engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| go through the building with them as they began to do the initial drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| So the short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| I would very much appreciate, Commissioner and Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| the opportunity, and I know Ms. Kincannon would as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| to step back a little bit and really talk more broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| about the entire capital improvement plan that's before you this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| from the school's perspective, and then also certainly address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| some of the questions and concerns that have come up over the Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| the project at the Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| So if it's appropriate, Mr. Chairman, for us to do that at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| I would really appreciate that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| I'm willing to yield the floor to the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| as long as you come back to me after he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| And I'd ask Ms. Kincannon, the chair of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| to begin with sort of the overview, and then I'll talk to some specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Luthold, other members, other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| I won't take up too much of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| I've had the opportunity to speak to many of you over the last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| and I'm here tonight on behalf of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| to respectfully ask your support for the school portion of the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| which is $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| I believe and the Board believes that this plan is fiscally responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| It addresses needs across the county, and it addresses these based on need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| not on politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| The Board approved this unanimously back in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| and in my discussions with some of you over the last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| I heard several questions, and I'd like to try to briefly answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| The first question I heard from many people, many commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| is is the Carter Elementary School building worth saving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| And the answer is, based on the analysis we've had, is absolutely yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Renovation is cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| The building has good bones to the extent that there are environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| They're very similar to ones that Knox County Schools has dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| with many other renovation projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| and they'll be dealt with in a safe manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| and in a way that's healthy and safe for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| The second question I heard a lot is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Knox County Schools building schools at a greater cost per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| than the surrounding school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| The answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Our costs are similar, sometimes lower than projects across the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| And I'm going to let Dr. McIntyre furnish you with a memo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| and some backup material with some data to support these contentions over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| and he can delve into more details in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| The last question I heard a lot about, I heard from several of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| is what's the harm in delaying and studying this further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| And in my reflecting upon this, delay has certain costs and uncertain benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| If you choose to delay tonight, it postpones all the projects across the whole county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| including a lot of projects that aren't the kind of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| that you have ribbon-cutting ceremonies for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| but protect the taxpayer investment in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| We have projects to stabilize foundations, to improve HVAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| and to do new roofs at various schools across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| We have some renovation plans at Chilhowee Intermediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| You've had the opportunity to review it, but delay will postpone all of those projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| and it will not necessarily have any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| If you delay, there's no change in the underlying information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| upon which the Board of Education relied to set these priorities in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| So I urge you not to postpone this plan and to consider it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| and hopefully vote to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| I just want to end by saying we're in the business of educating children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| and making the best use of our scarce resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| and we want high-quality facilities for kids across the county, including Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| And I do understand the frustration of the Carter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| and I applaud them for their enthusiastic support and attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| at recent community meetings and tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| And this Board of Education is ready to spend $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| on a comprehensive renovation at the Carter campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| and I think that the Carter community will be proud of these renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| and I hope that you'll support us in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I'm going to now let Dr. McIntyre give you a few more details on the plan as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| and also in answering some of those questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Could I ask you one question first, Ms. Kincannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Did I understand you to say that in March the Board voted unanimously for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| That's correct. I reviewed it myself just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| But yes, and actually at the time a representative from Carter PTA urged us to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| saying they preferred a new school, but seeing that renovations were what was warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| and what the superintendent was recommending, they wanted us not to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| You said it was fair and equitable across the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| So you're telling me that the Carter school board member voted for this too, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| All I want to know. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| Thank you, Commissioners, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Chairwoman Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| I want to sort of step back for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| I'm the superintendent of schools, 912 South Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| and really step back a little bit and give a little bit more context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| about this entire capital improvement plan and what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| We've had a lot of conversation about the Carter campus project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| and I think that's appropriate since it's a major investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| But I also want to give the broader context of what this capital improvement looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| And I want to start by just stepping back a little bit and saying a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| more than a year ago, almost 18 months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| the Board of Education, with a pretty substantial amount of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| defined five capital priorities, five capital project priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| They were renovations at Chilhowee Intermediate School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| an environmentally friendly or green addition at Bell Morris Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| a new elementary school in the southwest sector of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| a facility for a potential STEM, which is Science, Technology, Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| and Mathematics, Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| and significant upgrades to the Carter Elementary and Middle School campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| This capital improvement addresses all of those issues in some way or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| over the period that it addresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| as well as many other important capital needs in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| in the school district across our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| There are three major components to the capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| The first is major projects, which, as it sounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| are some of the major construction, renovation, upgrade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| and expansion projects that we have in this capital improvement plan for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| The second is roofs and HVAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| And then the third is what we call physical plant upgrades, or PPUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| And those are typically smaller projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| than the multimillion-dollar major projects that we talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| but no less important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| And I would say that the roofs and HVAC and foundations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| and some of the PPUs really aren't the kind of glamorous stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| as Ms. Kincannon says, that you have a ribbon-cutting ceremony for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| but they are extremely important in terms of the ongoing maintenance of our school buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| and our ability to make sure that we have a healthy, safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| and appropriate learning environment for all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| I want to just give you a flavor of what some of that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| So in terms of major HVAC projects, we have two major projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| one at Carnes High School and one at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Those total $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Major roof projects, we have a major roof project going on at Bearden High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| and at Vine Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Those total $1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| And we've made, in addition to those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| we've made a $5 million commitment to our physical plant upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| And, again, these are important projects that need to be done across the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| to keep our facilities up to date and make sure we can provide that great learning environment for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| Just to give you a flavor of some of what's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| for PPUs across the district, $520,000 for electrical upgrades at South Doyle High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| $65,000 to replace worn carpeting at Sarah Moore Green Magnet School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| $120,000 for new floor tile and asbestos abatement at Bearden Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| $522,000 for new secure classroom door locks at one-third of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| $218,000 for new bleachers in the gymnasium at Halls High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| and $75,000 for the build-out of the Education Resource Center at the Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| So you can see, just to give you a sense of it, there's lots of important work going on across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| and we really do take a very close look at what the facility needs are across our school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| and apply resources to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| In terms of the major projects that are in this capital plan, this three-year capital plan that the board adopted in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| they would include a $3.5 million project at Chilhowee Intermediate School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| That will systematically address many of the concerns at that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| They would include plumbing, HVAC, electrical, accessibility, flooring, and some general facility upgrades there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4064)|
| 1:07:53| That project will take place over the life of the three-year capital improvement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| to give us the flexibility to address different issues at different periods of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| to ensure that the learning can continue at Chilhowee over that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| The next major project is the Southwest Knox County Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| and we're looking at, in terms of the capital improvement plan that was approved by the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| we're looking at targeting construction to begin in fiscal year 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| and probably a two-year or so construction period and design in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| design and the architectural work to be done in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| so that it potentially, if on an aggressive schedule, could open as early as August of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| The new Southwest Elementary School was approved by the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| predicated upon an understanding of our projected enrollment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| that in that sector of the county is projected to increase by some 500-plus students in the next five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| The board really looked at whether that magnitude of increased capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| and increased educational spaces could be addressed in any other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| and decided that really it required a new facility to be able to address that quantity of educational spaces that will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:11| Enrollment in the rest of the school district really is either looking flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| or modest to moderate growth over that same period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| So we have substantial growth in one area that we know we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| We know we're going to have 500 more kids, and we have to have a space for them to be educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| Bell Morris Elementary School, we're looking at in the very early stages of a preliminary design for Bell Morris Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:36| a green addition, an environmentally friendly addition at Bell Morris Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| It's about a $1.75 million project, and that's budgeted for fiscal year 2013 in this three-year capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:51| Gresham Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Gresham, as you notice, was not one of the capital priority projects that the board adopted a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| But in the meantime, we've done some additional work and assessment in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| and found really that we do have to have some work done to address some fairly immediate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| It's almost a $4 million project at Gresham over the three-year period that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| and again, plumbing, HVAC, electrical systems in that facility, and we'll do that over the period of the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:22| And then the last major project before talking about the Carter Campus Project is science labs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:30| We want to make sure that we have appropriate facilities for our students in high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| make sure that they have appropriate laboratories to do their academic work and to support their learning in the sciences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| And so we've taken an assessment, taken a look at all of our science labs across the county, across all of our high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| and an independent team, well, an internal team, but a team made up of science folks and facilities folks went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| and looked at each of those science labs and has made some recommendations around doing some work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| That's proposed for fiscal year 2013, but we think we're pushing to see if we can identify some funds earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| and we think that we may be able to do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Let me now turn to the Carter Campus Project, and this is a project, a major renovation and expansion at the Carter Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:20| It will do three major things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| One, it will build a new elementary, excuse me, a new middle school gymnasium at the Carter Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| It will improve the traffic flow of the campus, and then it will include a substantial renovation and expansion of the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| It's a $5 million project in terms of a major project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| There's also a couple of other things that are going on there, like the roof that we're going to do at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| and some of the tiling and asbestos abatement that we'll do while we're doing this major renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| so that we take care of some of that infrastructure along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| In terms of what we're going to see at Carter Elementary School, we'll see a new secure main entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| that is adjacent to new administrative offices so that they are in plain view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| and there's a single entrance that we'll use, and the folks in the main office can see who's coming and going from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:08| We think that enhances the safety at the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| We're going to see significant enhancements to the cafeteria, to the library media center, to the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| The elementary school will take over what has been the middle school gymnasium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| and while it's not up to snuff in terms of a middle school facility for athletics and physical education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| it does meet many of our specifications for an elementary school gymnasium, and so we're going to do some work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| Enhancements to the cafeteria, library, and gymnasium, improved infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| and then additional classrooms that will obviate the need for the portable classroom facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| that are currently associated with the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| I think it's an impressive design, and for those of you who have seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| we've had the architects both at school board meetings and at the community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| and it's an impressive design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| It's a substantial investment in the Carter schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| and I think it will create an attractive and functional learning environment for many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| As Ms. Kincannon said, I think it is a sound investment to renovate this existing structure that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:16| It is a solid structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| It's structurally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| It will be highly functional with this renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| and as we look at the building's infrastructure, to Commissioner Leuthold's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| when we look at plumbing, electrical, foundation, walls, HVAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| those are either in good shape or are going to be part of the renovation as it's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| and as we pursue it in terms of the $5 million project that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| and a structural engineer did go through the building with the architects as part of the initial conceptual design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| I do want to address the issues that we take very seriously our obligation around the health and safety of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| and if there are any environmental issues that are identified through this project, we will address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| but I do want to say at this point in time, there are no significant active environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| that we're aware of at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| We've talked with, we've had indoor air quality assessments done in 2004 and 2006 that came back positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:24| I've had some conversation with Ms. Julie Thompson, who's the principal at Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| and while there have been, occasionally in the past, there have been mold issues here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| they've been addressed by our facilities department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| and so again, we are not aware of any significant active environmental issues at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| but if we do identify those, those will be addressed as part of the work that we do in renovating the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| There was, at one point in time, a couple years ago, there was an incident with sewerage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| and there was at one point a backup of part of the sewerage infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| but I'm told that that was a specific incident and not necessarily endemic to a faulty sewer or substandard infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| It was something that got clogged in the piping, and it backed it up, and it was addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| So, you know, we do take our obligations around student health and safety very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| and if there are issues to be addressed, we're going to address those as we move along through this renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| We are replacing the tile, and we were scheduled to do that potentially earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:36| but we figured as we're doing a major renovation, we'd do that at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| We will replace those tiles and abate the asbestos that goes along with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| and take care of that issue through this major renovation that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| You know, at this time, I believe that renovation is cost effective, it is fiscally responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| and it is the best way for us to create a safe, healthy learning environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| and an inviting learning environment for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| And I think we really need to make sure that we do have a learning environment at Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| that is reflective of the outstanding education that our students are getting in that school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| Students are being extraordinarily well educated, and we want to make sure that the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| the physical structure, the physical plant is reflective of that wonderful education that they're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| We've done renovations in the past. We build in contingency in case we do find things that are unexpected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| In recent history, we've done Holston Middle School, we've done Cedar Bluff Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| Those were very complicated projects that came in within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| And, you know, so we have some history of being able to do this type of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| and being able to do it within the resources that we set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| So I wanted to address that question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| And then, you know, in terms of building cost, Miss Kincannon really did address some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| We've taken a look, and it's in your packet and it's online as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| Our Facilities Department has done a cost analysis of some of the projects that have occurred regionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| and also here within the Knox County Schools in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| The one example that folks seem to gravitate to is Paulette Elementary School in Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| The analysis that was done by our facilities folks says that's about a $103 per square foot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| Our Gibbs Elementary School that we built a few years ago was done $97 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| And the ball camp expansion that we just broke ground for recently is slated to be about $106 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| So we're not that far off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| I will say the Hardin Valley Academy, which is a much different project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| It was managed by the Public Building Authority, but it's a high school project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| And with high schools, you have laboratories, you have theaters, you have different types of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| than you have at an elementary school and probably not as comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| Came in, I'm told, around I think about $140 a square foot when you put it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| In terms of the Southwest Elementary School that we're looking at building in that sector of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| that's about a $15.5 million construction cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| And we are looking at probably in the neighborhood of about, our assumptions were about 135 or so thousand square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| for that project, which translates to about $115 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| So again, that's our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| That hasn't been bid yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| That hasn't been designed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| We don't know what that will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| But our budget is $115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| It could come in less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| But we want to make sure that we have the resources available, depending on what that bid does come in at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| to be able to move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| But again, it's not really outside the ballpark of some of the other projects that have happened within the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| We do publicly bid our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| And I think while we do have high standards for our facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| we do also make sure that we get the best possible value for the work that we do in our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| And that's important to us, and we take pride in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| I guess to wrap up, I would say I believe that the Board of Education has adopted a fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| fiscally responsible, and educationally sound capital improvement project, capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| that will help make sure that we have a suitable learning environment for all of our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| and an environment where they can be academically successful, which is what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| In this challenging environment, I respectfully request that the commission do move forward with adopting this capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:38| And I would also, as Ms. Kincannon did, ask that you take action on this capital improvement plan today, if at all possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:48| because another 30-day delay begins to jeopardize some of the projects that we had planned for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:56| And they are important projects, and they are projects that we do across the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| and that we try to get a lot of work done when our kids aren't in school so that we can be ready for the new school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| And if we delay another 30 days, we really jeopardize a lot of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| And I can be more specific about some of those projects if folks want to hear examples of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| but I think it's important that action be taken so that we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| Again, I would respectfully request that the commission adopt the capital improvement plan that was approved by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| I'd be glad to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| And we do have additional folks here who could be helpful in some of these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| Doug Dillingham, who is our supervisor of facilities, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| Jim French, who is our supervisor for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| And Rob Riley, who is our environmental supervisor, is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| And I'd be glad to take whatever questions that the commission may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| Commissioner Luthor, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Dr. McIntyre, out of that $5 million, you're going to spend how much on the gym?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| About $1.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Or how much is the gym?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| I believe that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Let me get the numbers in front of me if I may, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| $1.65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| $1.65?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| So a little less than $3.5 million for the rest of the renovations out there, which part of it is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Paving and new traffic pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| So you've got some paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| You mentioned the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Now, is the roof going to be within that $5 million, or is that in addition to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| It's in addition to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| How much is the roof going to cost, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| $224,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| $224,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Then you mentioned PPUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Because I'm concerned about when I toured through Carter Elementary a couple weeks back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| one of the things I walked away with is that it was dark, seemed a little dingy, and not a very –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:14| and not the most cheerful place for young students to try to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| So I'm concerned about the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| I'm concerned about the walls and the paint and making sure that when these kids walk in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| that it's a good environment for them to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| And I'm concerned about when we were looking at the map and what was going to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| and I saw the additions and I liked what you were going to do out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| so I'm concerned about the existing classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| and it didn't look like you were doing anything in the existing classrooms and down the main hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4972)|
| 1:23:00| So are there any plans for that, new windows, new lighting fixtures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| making sure that it's painted and it's a bright, cheerful place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| Because to me it was just – it seemed a little dark and dingy to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| Well, Commissioner, a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| One, you saw the school building when there were no children in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| You saw it when there was furniture in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| You saw it when there was furniture in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| You saw it when the lights were out in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| So I hope that you got an appropriate –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Well, actually, I didn't – we didn't get to go into the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| We walked back where the office was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| We went to the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| We went to the – I guess the playroom, activity room, whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| I walked into the library, and I understand you're moving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| And all those things, you know, what you showed me I'm glad we're doing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| But I'm just talking about the rest of the building seemed like it needed more upgrades to it than just those few areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| Are there plans to do any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| I think the honest answer is we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| The honest answer is we will look at – you know, we've identified the major components of the renovation that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:22| We have identified that floor tiling is one area that we will do some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| So if the bid comes in within an appropriate level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| certainly we will want to do some of the cosmetic things that will make it look bright and cheery and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| And we typically do that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| I mean, we try to – if we're walking away from a major renovation where we've spent more than $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| we're going to want to address some of those little things like –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| Well, and here again, I still have a problem with calling it a $5 million project because it's really about a three and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5089)|
| 1:25:02| I think it's three and a half for the elementary and a little over one and a half for the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| because the middle school definitely needs a gym that is up to snuff as far as the rest of the middle schools across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:17| Now – and I've heard some of the other examples that you were given in the three – was it about $3 million or $2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| How much were you going to spend at some of the other – I mean, like at Chilhowee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Chilhowee is $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| $3.5 million, so you're spending about the same amount there as you're spending at this school, which I don't know how –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| I've not been to Chilhowee, so I don't know how to compare it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| So I'm concerned when I walk through there, is $3.5 million going to be enough for what I saw as much as needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:57| And when we're done with it, like I discussed with you and Ms. Kincannon, was that once we're done, we're probably not going to be out there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5157)|
| 1:26:09| And I want to have a permanent, at least a 30 to 40 year fix, and you and I talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:24| Because I don't want to spend $3.5 or $5, however you want to term it, and in 10 years needing to go back to do more major renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:34| So I don't know if Doug needs to answer this, but if we need to go in there and really do this right, do we need more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:44| Because I'd rather go ahead and vote on that now, come up with the money now, if we're really going to do a renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| Because I see that it's going to take more than just the $3.5 million for just the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| And that's just my opinion. I'm not an engineer. I'm not an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| But just seeing what things have cost in Knox County when we get into them, I mean, just how confident are we that we're not going to be back here in another year saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:12| we need another million or two million to finish this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| And I will let Ms. Billingham come up and speak a little bit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| But I think what's important is you see our willingness as we're doing a major renovation to also look at the physical plant upgrade resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:28| And to apply those to a total project cost that will allow us to do some things at the same time, the roof and the floor tiles and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:37| So we're open to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| And I think we want to see what this, you know, we've defined the conceptual project and what that should look like and what the major components of that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| I think there is some to be determined in terms of will that include something like painting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| Will that include other other cosmetic types of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| We typically when we walk away from a major renovation like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| we typically walk away having done some of those cosmetic things because you want it to look nice as you as you've invested a substantial amount of money in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:07| Well, that's my fear is that we'd spend this three and a half million out there because I think the gym is going to look wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| I don't have a problem with the gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| I'm just concerned that with this three and a half, another 200 and something for the roof that needs to be done anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5295)|
| 1:28:24| I'm just concerned that once we spend this, that it needs, like I said, it needs to be a permanent fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| The parents, the community, when they walk back into this building, they need to go, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| And I don't know that we got the wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| I think we got barely the function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| And I think these folks deserve a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:51| So how sure are we that we're going to be able to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| Because, you know, my final question was how much PPUs are we going to spend out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| Is that going to be, how much more addition are we going to have on top of the three and a half million to go out of the PPUs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| Because that needs to be spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| I mean, and that's the problem we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| We just don't have a whole lot of money and we're spread very, very thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| And I understand how the complexity of what you're trying to do and balance this throughout the community, throughout the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:26| So, and I'm not trying to say this is a criticism at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| because I truly believe that you folks within the school system are trying to do the best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| And this is not trying to say that you're slighting one community or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| I just want to make sure that when we get done with this, this community gets what it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:50| And Commissioner, we have the same goal in terms of the outcome that we want to see is for all of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| including students at Carter Elementary, to have a safe, healthy, inviting learning environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| And so, you know, we're in the conceptual stage right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| We've addressed, we've identified the elements that we think address the major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| We've put into this plan, the architectural plan and the conceptual design, contingency dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| which we typically do, to ensure that we have the appropriate resources to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| I mean, we have a track record, if you look at Holston, if you look at Cedar Bluff Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| of working through major renovations and making sure that we do it right and do it within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| Now, getting back to the capital plan, you've got, actually the SPI mean is divided over a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| The plan that was adopted by the school board had the plan in year one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| but the financing, as I understand it, that's been recommended through the mayor's budget, has the financing over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:58| Well, this may be a John Troyer question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| We've already approved the 17 point whatever million dollar bond issue, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Let's say we approve what's before us tonight, and we get a year down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| and we're going to see that, hey, we do need another million or we need more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| then I guess the commission next year and the school board could come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| let's say we need another million or two or whatever to finish the project to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| Is that going to be feasible to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| One of the things that, you know, in this capital planning process, we would ask the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| and we would ask the county commission to make a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| This is what we plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| These are our full expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| But we fully expect to come back to this and review this, ask the school board to review it a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| ask the commission to review it a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Is this still what we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| What we're asking the commission for is to appropriate the money for the first year only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| and then we'll come back and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Will we be appropriating any money this year for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| Yeah, $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| And then so the other $3 million will be coming in the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| And if we need another million, say, next year, do you think that could be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| Well, it depends on, you know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| I know there's a lot of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| It depends on whether or not our property tax is coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| and whether or not the sales tax is picked up, which we've seen a slight increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| It's ticked up instead of ticking down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| And if you just say, you just assume that the economy stays the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| and conditions are just as we would expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| then it would be consideration for the school board to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| where does that fit in our priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| And they would have to take a look at all the different things that they're charged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| or the responsibility to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| and see where that project maps in with the rest of their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| And, you know, that's a process the school board would have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| And this is my dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| And I'm going to wrap this up, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| so I know there's a lot of questions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| and hopefully maybe some of this got answered with my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| I don't want to delay other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| There's projects that need to be done, as Dr. McIntyre alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| but I think this is a very important issue on this particular school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| because this is their one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| And I don't know if there's another shot come next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| but if you get into the project, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| and you see that it's going to take more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| are you going to be coming forward to the commission in a year and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| Hey, we underestimated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| We need more money to finish this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Are you going to be able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| The only way we would be able to do that is if that's the will of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Commissioner, and, again, I anticipate that we have requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:22| and approved the appropriate level of investment to get the project done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| Do we run into unexpected issues in building projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| Sure we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| And if we ran into one that was a major impediment to doing this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| and doing it appropriately and making sure we have a safe, healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| appropriate learning environment for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| then we would have to step back and talk to the Board about what our priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| But we've gotten to the point in the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| where we don't anticipate anything that would be a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| or a $2 million impediment to getting this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| Might there be $20,000 or $50,000 worth of cosmetic work that we might want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| while we're at it that might come out of our PPUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| or might come out of savings in another project that came in under budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| That's certainly a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| But I really don't anticipate, at this point in the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| having had the architects go through, having the structural engineers go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| I don't anticipate a major issue of that nature surfacing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| But could it? Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| And if it does, we'll have to reassess where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| And one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| If we do the renovation, what's your plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| or what do you think your plans will be to do with the property on Strawberry Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| that was meant to hold a new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Because obviously if we do this, like I said, it needs to be a 30 to 40-year fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| We don't need to be land banking a property like that for that long just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| So would you be looking to surplus that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| I think that's a good question, and it's one that the school board has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| And my sense of the will of the school board is that we take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| at all of the properties that we own across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| that are not currently being used actively as schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| and to assess whether there are any opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| to divest ourselves of those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| but to do so extraordinarily conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Because if there is ever an opportunity to use those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| even if it's 20, 30, 40 years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| we're not going to want to sell those properties right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| because it would be very difficult to get them back at the prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| at which we procured them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| I just think you need to do a complete inventory of all your properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| see what's needed and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| Earlier this evening, I'm going to read a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| I'm not going to ask you a question if you'd care to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| Save your strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| We'll be here till midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| This is page one of 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| No, seriously now, earlier tonight, I think by name, I thanked by name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| those commissioners that traveled out to Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| One commissioner, well, commissioners on both sides of me traveled two nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| So thank you for making those trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5851)|
| 1:37:41| Now, as those applause are still ringing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| you're also patting yourself on the back for being here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| being a concerned citizen, and looking for the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| whatever the best is, for the students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| As I was getting ready to do this about a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| I took my wife and we went and we shopped and we were looking for a green jacket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Our Larry Smith said he had one, but he didn't tell me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| I don't think he wanted me to wear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| He was afraid I'd get red on it or blue or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| I did get a green shirt and a green tie, and I've got green shoes now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| if you know anybody who'd like to wear a pair of green shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| Tonight, commissioners, we're making a once-in-a-lifetime decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| Since last month, there have been two public meetings in the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| to discuss the capital spending at the Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| As I've stated earlier, for me, this begins with that one word, possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:47| being placed in front of constructing four new classrooms in the county capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:58| That may be explained away in that if there's not a need for four additional classrooms at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| well, we won't have to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| But that's where I started, and I think that if the portables are moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:15| you have to have four new classrooms just to seat the kids that are there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| What really is at stake in the Carter community in this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| really comes a little bit more clear to me in the superintendent's most recent memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| He named five or six or so things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| New admin office, cafeteria, library, media center, gymnasium, infrastructure, and eliminate the modules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:51| I've written down here, I assume that each of you have had a call from the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| and the chairman of the school board to sell you on tonight's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| I received those same calls, but through an admission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| I know everyone received those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| It's only tonight, though, that I've had the opportunity to get your undivided attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| and tell you what I think of what might be going on and ask you to consider some certain points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| So far, we've authorized, the school board has authorized to spend up to $250,000 on a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:29| Arriving at a plan, we, the board of education, whoever, we have seven green pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:40| I'm sorry I don't have copies for everyone, but if you want to see my copies, I've got them right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| If you want to borrow my laptop, you can see them online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| But really, after I count the seven pages, you only have to look at two of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| for it's a ground floor and an upper floor, just block diagrams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:59| The redo that we're looking at at Carter Elementary is a huge undertaking of small things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:10| Whether it be large to small things, whether it be large things like heating and air conditioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:19| or whether it be four tables and a cafeteria, or as mentioned earlier, whether it be the plumbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| but I assume the plumbing from the new building is going to go to the old place, so I don't know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| We're going to take down a boiler room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| We're going to add an acre of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:43| We're going to have new administrative space, but first we've got to move a grease pit, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| I don't know, maybe we're not going to have a grease pit in the new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| but the grease pit I think sits where the new office space is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| I have questions, but I've not really asked them out in the open about how fire safe is the place going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| What are we going to have to do to make the place fire safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| Hallways, fire hardened, or doors where we now have doors with just plain glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:17| A moment ago we even added to it we might have to do something with the foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| I didn't have that down until I wrote it down just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| I didn't have relighting. We're going to rewire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| I did have down, how about windows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| And how about fire escapes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| I'm a retired AT&T guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| AT&T building, I moved from one end of Gay Street to the other end of Gay Street, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| In the AT&T building at the other end of Gay Street, there's at least three or four fire escapes hardened outside the footprint of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:55| At Carter Elementary on the front of the building, there are four fire escapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| Their door is about so big, painted red, I guess the teacher grabs up the kid, opens the door, and throws him out with a scruff of his neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6180)|
| 1:43:09| I'm saying that tongue in cheek, but really to me that's one of the things that's on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| We've talked about asbestos abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| We've talked about lead paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| We're not even talking about how's that going to be done when the kids are on their way during the summer for ten or so weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:28| We're removing the portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| I think there are six portables on the campus, but the next question comes is maybe only three or four are associated with the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:39| Two are in the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| That's four more classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Is the middle school at capacity or close to capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| What's the growth there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| But that's not really a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Let me focus now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Let me regain my focus and get back on Carter Elementary because that's what we're talking about tonight is Carter Elementary and its capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6230)|
| 1:44:00| And then, wait a minute, I need to back up to floor space, I mean floor tile, don't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| EPA has new recommendations that were going to be in effect now, but now they've been put off this fall because we've got some kind of flood in Nashville that's got things slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:14| I don't know if there's going to be in the middle of or before this contract is bid, will there be new EPA stuff on how do we renovate a historic location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:27| And by the way, I don't have my historic register application here, but if this is a historically registered school building, I know we won't want to renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:43| Right off on the deep end of historical registration there, I want to go back for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| It's a school with solid bones like Holston, and I heard someone compare it to Cedar Bluff at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| I believe on the other page that I wrote, Commissioner Leuthold compared it to Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| If I remember the renovation that took place at Cedar Bluff, it took a long time, and parts of the old school are no longer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| which might mean that if part of the Carter School is not there, the part that's at the front, right now where the front door is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| with the wooden floors that was built in 19- and we have a question there, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| 1938 or 1913?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| 1938, 1913. Just pick a date from the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:33| In the Carter case, though, if we begin to expand the scope, we may not be able to meet the monetary standards as set by Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:43| and his definition of TIFs, and I only throw that in there because I appreciate your comments, Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:51| but you did make one other comment about closets and storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| There is none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6356)|
| 1:46:05| Change of subject just for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| Carter is the top 1% school in the state of Tennessee, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:31| But I think there's some perennial concern associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| Not all the students that should be zoned, that are zoned to Carter Elementary are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| I don't think there's a pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| I don't think Americans with Disabilities are serviced at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:55| and some parents that attended some of these meetings are saying they have students that are zoned to Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| but they are not in Carter's school because they have concerns about their children being in that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:11| So I think that whenever we do look at the head count, and I've got head count figures here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| the MPC's estimates from four or five years ago are still 40 or 50 head beneath the number of kids that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:29| and all the kids aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Now, for just a second, I want to change from the focus on what we're going to do to how we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:42| Commissioner Leuthold, I really appreciate your in-depth study into where the dollar goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| but as I said, there was two pages of the ground floor and upper floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| There's only a half a page of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| It's true on the dollar page there is $224,000 appropriated for the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:13| $122,000 for design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| There are no dollars on this piece of paper for floor tile, but let me let that one slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| The subtotal of all this is $5 million, but if you add those back into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| the amount that's going to be spent at Carter Elementary is $5,346,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:38| We're going to get $150,000 worth of furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| I just hope it's – this is really terribly for me to say, but I'm going to say it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| I just hope it's new furniture and not furniture from somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:58| Construction subtotals, then to back on out to a number of what the construction subtotal is going to be, $5,096,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:07| but the best line on here is the line you need to replace your $3.5 million with is additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:16| and renovations to elementary school is $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:29| Not 5, not 3.5, 2.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:40| Now, a couple of other points that I think that have been made derogatorily about Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| I really appreciate it when people send me emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| I get down to reading them every two or three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| One of the comments that's been made about Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| the reason that there's no need to spend money there is because we don't pay any taxes in the East County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6601)|
| 1:50:12| There's no tax base in the East County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| I received two or three insulting emails, and that one I want to say that I think, I firmly believe that in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:29| the school board is dedicated to education in Knox County and that it's equal across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:38| I expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| So if someone says that education is poor in East County, that's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| I'm talking about dollars and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| And last, maybe we should have said this a few hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| I'm not opposed to any other action on the Board of Education's capital spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| I'm not in opposition to any other item on Knox County's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:13| No questions about any other items in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| I'm focused only on Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| And for Commissioner Pinkston, rhetorically, I might ask which schools in South Knoxville are older than 1913,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| but whenever you ask rhetorically, I'm not looking for an answer, so forgive me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| I'm also not interested in did Mr. Phillips vote this way or that or give input to the school board plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6695)|
| 1:51:43| or how did my current appointed school board member vote on any issue if he's the only vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| That doesn't really mean anything either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| Really, what my statement is about is that the Board of Education has brought us Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| The people here assembled this evening have brought me a question to ask Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| Are we doing the right thing at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| Will all that is promised come in or at under $2.2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6732)|
| 1:52:21| An answer, to be quite honest, Dr. McIntyre, is I'm quoting you, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| This is not about politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| It's about dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| I think we agree in the fact that we're looking for a 20 or 30-year fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:41| without it coming back at being over $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| And I go back to something, fellow commissioners, that I opened with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| It's my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| We're making a once-in-a-lifetime decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| We need to make sure it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Commissioner Strickland, could I answer a question I was asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Mr. Strickland, could I answer a question I was asked by Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| He said it was rhetorical, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| I'll answer it when you get to my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| We're going to have to start tightening up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| I'm going to have to go to the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Hopefully we'll, I speak in 30-second increments, so hopefully I'll be done in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| Superintendent McIntyre, I joined you and I joined Commissioner Wright at Carter Elementary several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| when we were doing a tour of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| It was rather cold that day, and we toured probably about five or six different classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| and I remember that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| The first thing I remember is walking into the school, and I was taken aback, I guess really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| by the long hallway and how long it took you to get down to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| Now, I will say that security is very good at Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| because I wasn't in that building more than 10 or 15 seconds before I was approached by the school security officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| wanting to know who I was and why I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| But still, the long hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| That's what Commissioner Luthel had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| That was the second thing that I seemed to notice as I was walking down the hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| was it just seemed to be, I don't want to use the word dingy or dark, but I guess those words would suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:29| Then we met with the superintendent, we met with the folks back in their office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| and then we went into the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| Those classrooms appeared to me to be very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| Now, again, I'm sure that since it's an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| that the square footage may be smaller than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| I don't know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| But I remember talking with a couple of the teachers who were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| because I noticed that the backpacks and the coats and all of the things that children bring with them to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| they didn't seem to have lockers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| They had some hooks on the walls, and they were able to put their belongings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| A couple of other teachers, at least two teachers, mentioned the fact that they had 24 students in their classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| And so we asked the question, well, what happens if you get two or three more students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| And they said, well, we're probably going to have to go into, I guess it was a gymnasium type area where there was an auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:22| So they took us in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| We went in there, and they said this is where we would have to handle an overflow of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| if indeed we do get more students that come to Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| Another issue seemed to be the handicapped students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| In the public hearing the other evening, the statement was made that students who have children who are handicapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| are told you can't come to Carter, we can't accommodate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| Now, I'm wondering if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| If that is, that's to me a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| The sewage backup was also mentioned, and it's been stated that that was a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6954)|
| 1:56:01| The other things that we talk about are the asbestos issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| I'm wondering, do we really know the extent of the asbestos issues in that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| The other thing is with the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| It was brought up at the community meeting, brought up here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| the fact that the playground is an issue because you have to cross the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| Then we look at, okay, what is going to happen to the land that's there if we're not going to build a new building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| How many classrooms are we going to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Is this going to eliminate a potential for some of those classrooms that have 24 students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| Let's say that you do get some other students who come in and it approaches 25, 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| Will we go with 25, 26 students, or will they indeed have to move into that other area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| I was also told that they're already using that area some for some of the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:49| The other thing that struck me too is I understand now why Carter is in the top 1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| because the teachers that I met were first class, top notch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| I mean they, you could tell that they were, you could, I've had four children go through Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:10| You can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I mean you can tell after you've talked with somebody for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| and after talking with these teachers it was pretty obvious that they're there to teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| They're there for the kids and they're there for their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| And so it seems to me that every child in Knox County is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:26| Every aspect of Knox County is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| And I guess my bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| I remember going to Cedar Bluff when we were talking about what we needed to do to Cedar Bluff representing that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| And I remember going in at lunchtime and here comes these little kids who were in another building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| They had no cafeteria in their other building and it was also a very cold day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| And they had to bring the kids out and march them down the way into the central area to get their lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| They got their little trays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Then they turned right back around and had to walk back across to get their lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| And so I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| I said, well, what happens when it rains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| They said, well, we get umbrellas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| And I said, well, what happens when it gets really, really cold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Well, we put coats on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| And I said, but you're having to walk through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| And I remember looking at my commissioner, Commissioner Luthold and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| and we looked at each other and said, we can do better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| I would say to our folks here and to the taxpayers of Knox County, we can do better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:35| It is a hard thing to come in and say, let's appropriate more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| But I am willing to go for a new school for Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| I am willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:55| I understand that there are financing issues, and so I don't know if there's going to be a resolution to this effect or a substitute resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7135)|
| 1:59:04| But I would be willing to incorporate a substitute that we approve the capital plan with the exception of Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| and that we take another 30 days to study it, and let's see if we can come up with some additional funding, or at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| let's take a look at what substantial renovations would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| Because I'm with my colleagues, after having been there, looked at it, talked with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| and had hopefully taken, and again, there are needs all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| I'm not saying there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| But what I am saying is that with regards to this particular facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| I'm convinced that just spending $2.2 million just ain't going to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| And so I'm very willing to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| I'm going to go ahead and make that in the form of a motion that we pass the capital plan with the exception of Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| It will be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| Who will second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| I'm going to beg this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Mr. Chairman, that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| I'm just wondering if the commissioner would like the answers to any of his questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| What questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Did you ask any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| I believe you asked about several different things, and I can shed some light on some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| You asked about safety issues and the fact that the main office was all the way down the other end of the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| and that's precisely one of the design elements that we're looking at is reconfiguring the main entrance to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| so that the main entrance is where students are dropped off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| and that it's right next to the new administrative offices precisely to address that safety issue that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:53| You asked about compliance with ADA and accessibility issues at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7253)|
| 2:01:01| and that is part of also the conceptual design is to add an elevator at Carter Elementary School for just that purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7261)|
| 2:01:09| to be able to ensure that students and teachers and parents and visitors with disabilities have access to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:16| and are able to have mobility within the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| We do believe that we are aware of the extent of the asbestos that's in the tiling in the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:30| and are, again, looking to provide the resources to make the abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7290)|
| 2:01:38| and to replace those tiles that do have asbestos with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| And then the other question you asked is about space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| And this, again, this plan, this project for Carter Elementary School does contemplate the addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:55| a net addition of four additional classrooms to ensure that there is additional space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| if we do see some growth over the next many years at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| I agree with you. I think we can do better, and we plan to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| That's what this investment of $5 million is about at the Carter campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| is to make sure that we have the safe, healthy, inviting learning environment that our kids deserve in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:21| And I would agree with you also on the issue of the wonderful faculty that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| the wonderful leadership that we have, the wonderful parent involvement that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| I mean, look at the folks who have come out this evening to talk about they're here because they care about their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| and they're here because they care about their education of their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| And we agree, we want to make sure that we have a learning environment that is befitting the great education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| that our students get at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| We just differ on how to go about doing that in terms of what this plan outlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| and we believe that we can do that through a major renovation and expansion that's outlined in the Capital Improvement Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| One other, one final thing, Mr. Chairman, that I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| Commissioner Leuthold, I'll yield the floor to you. You had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| Mr. School Superintendent, how much are we spending on the elevator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7388)|
| 2:03:21| Doug Dillingham, Supervisor of Facilities and Construction, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| Mr. Commissioner, typically a full-blown elevator to meet ADA standards to stop will run roughly $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:39| $75,000, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| So that's going to come out of that 2.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| I'm going to beg this commission's indulgence for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| I have a reputation for being a bit long-winded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| One that I have done a lot of work on in the last few months, and if I go over the five minutes today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7436)|
| 2:04:03| I just hope you'll be patient with me because I have done a bit better with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| I'm going to vote for the substitute motion that Mr. Hammond has proposed, but I want to make it very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:17| I don't know that more money can be found for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| The numbers are the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| I also fully am aware of our authority as the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| The authority really lies in the hands of the school board and in the school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| I want to assure folks that the next mayor's administration, whoever that may be, they're just a human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7477)|
| 2:04:45| They're not going to be superhuman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| They're not going to be able to change the numbers as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| So I don't want to get folks' hopes up that there may be more money coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| because the truth is I don't see where more money could come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| I'm going to vote to send this back to the school board in the hopes that they will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:08| The comments that I'm about to make are suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| because I clearly acknowledge that I don't have the authority to dictate to you guys what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| You all are duly elected officials with your own authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| One thing that concerns me in Knox County in my years that I've spent on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| is it seems like we spend a lot more on schools per square foot than other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:33| When we were building Hardin Valley High School, beautiful school in my district, proud to represent that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| Sandy Loy with Construction Plus, and full disclosure, Sandy Loy is a friend of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| he built two schools in Claiborne County, one that won awards for roughly the same price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:56| As I was texting earlier, I love technology, with Sandy Loy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| he tells me that he can build a school for $5 million that will accommodate five to six hundred students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:16| Now, I know that Mr. Loy has not participated in Knox County with public buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7576)|
| 2:06:23| and the reason why is that until recently he was Mayor Ragsdale's brother-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| and I know that it wouldn't have looked right if Mr. Loy had built a school for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| while his brother-in-law was the mayor, but that is changing very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| and I think that you guys should meet with him, I think that you should talk with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| even if he's not the low bidder on a school, I think that perhaps you might benefit from his knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| because he's building schools all over Tennessee, brand new construction schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| and he's in agreement with me that it is cheaper to build from scratch than to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:12| And I warned him, you know, when we were texting back and forth, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| I can build a school for $5 million that will accommodate five to six hundred students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| I said, Sandy, and I texted him back, I said, Sandy, I'm going to let folks know that you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| And I said, you be ready for them to take you up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| He said, Mr. McIntyre, he said he would be delighted if you took him up on his offer to build a school for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7650)|
| 2:07:37| Now, again, the authority is with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| The authority is with the school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| In fact, other than the indulgence that my chairman has indulged me with today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7663)|
| 2:07:51| allowing me to have a bit more time on this issue, I have a little more power than these citizens out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| But I'm going to vote for Mr. Hammond's proposal, not that I think we can find more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| but I think that you guys can find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| This is an opportunity for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| This is an opportunity, Mr. McIntyre, for your office to be creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| and to find a way to build a new school, not a renovated school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| but to build a new school where it's much needed for these folks in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7700)|
| 2:08:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7722)|
| 2:08:49| Chairman Strickland, before you guys vote on the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| if I could ask a couple of questions to make sure I understand as chair of the board what the motion says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| But I can wait and hear the rest of the discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7739)|
| 2:09:07| Once again, I want to thank India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| You're the first school board, school board even member, let alone chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| to you've called me two or three times on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| And I appreciate your leadership, what you're trying to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| Dr. McIntyre, same with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| You called me Saturday, and I was in the middle of a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| and I thought of a question after I got off the phone with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| And, Doug, I enjoy these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| I enjoy when we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| I really get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| David Collins, you do excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| You know, your architecture skills and stuff, and I admire you as a former commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| What I want to get, that I want to relate to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:50| but I'm not going to talk a lot because I think you deserve to have, this is your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| and I want you to have the main say, you and David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| but I want to piggyback off some stuff that you all have said at some of the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| about being fiduciary responsible for what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| My concern is, you know, I don't want to tell you all what to do with the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| but we've been talking this for a couple of weeks is we can build other schools for the same amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7809)|
| 2:10:17| And I don't hear from you is, okay, we're going to try that or that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:23| And people are coming to, just like Commissioner Lambert said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| there's people here today that they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| People are starving for work right now, and we'll get a quality school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| But, you know, I'm for the thing is, guys, if we can give you five million of renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:41| or five million of a new school, what are we fighting over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| Let's go look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:52| So, Indian, Dr. McIntyre, you know, I want you, you know, and the people of Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| I want, number one, the best that we can do and the best for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| But I don't want to take a lot of time because there's a lot of things I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| and that you spoke at the meeting, and I want you to be able to say that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| I do have some comments and a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| One is that looking over this list of all of the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:29| I was looking at some dates and some notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| and it looks like over one quarter of the Knox County schools are as old or older than Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7893)|
| 2:11:52| I also have made notes here that over 70% of our Knox County schools have been remodeled or renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7912)|
| 2:12:02| and about 60% of those have had multiple renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| In fact, the school board has done a total of almost 150 renovations on our school buildings in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7929)|
| 2:12:22| Those are additions and renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| So I feel like the school board has had a lot of experience with doing renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:36| and knowing how much these are going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| I don't understand why we are treating the school board like they don't know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7959)|
| 2:12:46| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| I know that from experiences even in my own district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:58| the problems that we have with vacant school buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| and those properties become blighted so quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| and they are a tremendous drain on a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| We're struggling with that in the 2nd District right now with two empty schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:17| and another one that's right on the border between the 1st and 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| I'm sure that as you all have done almost 150 renovations on schools that are as old or older than Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:36| that you have run into problems with asbestos abatement and lead abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| and you have experience with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| In talking with some of the parents who called me this weekend and last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:50| I understand and share their concerns about student safety while renovations are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8030)|
| 2:13:58| So I would like to know if there is someone who can speak to how those kinds of renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:05| how that abatement is handled when there are students in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| And like I said, I'm sure that you have had experience with these kinds of abatements in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:19| in any old building you're going to have lead, you're going to have asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| And also I want to ask in the course of almost 150 additions and renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8065)|
| 2:14:33| that the school board has been in charge of for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| how often have you run into major cost overruns as the kind that people are suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8077)|
| 2:14:44| that you can't possibly do your renovations for this X amount of dollars because it's just not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8084)|
| 2:14:52| And I really feel like you all have done enough of these to have the kind of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:59| that you could make a fairly good educated guess on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| So I'm wondering if you would address those two questions for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8103)|
| 2:15:11| Yes, Doug Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| Commissioner, to begin with on asbestos abatement, abatement is scheduled when children are not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:22| So we originally had the abatement scheduled for Carter Elementary School for the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| but we have postponed it to coincide with a major project that we are planning over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8127)|
| 2:15:34| because in doing the abatement, we would take the old out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| we would put new floor tile down to come in a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| and start renovation to take the new floor tile back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| And so it just didn't make sense to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| So we have postponed that to happen to coincide with this major project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:56| So the asbestos removal will not take place while the children are in session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| And we adhere to all federal regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| We actually have a staff member and environmental engineer on our maintenance staff now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| that helps oversee all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| As far as the second question is concerned, in major overruns that we've had on projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| the facilities department has been in existence since 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| During that time, we have had one project that we actually had to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| and request additional money for a change order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| and that was phase three of Cedar Bluff Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| Otherwise, every project that we have handled, we have completed under budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:44| and had one final change order at the end that was a credit back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8204)|
| 2:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| I do want also to say that definitely this school needs work, no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8211)|
| 2:17:07| There's also no question that there are a lot of other schools too that also need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:15| I know that the students at Bell Morris, their parents would love to have a new school for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:21| Richard Yokely is a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| It's a disgrace and needs serious help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| There's no question that Carter needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| I don't think any of us are debating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| We all want top-notch first-rate facilities for all of the children in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:46| not just in one community or another community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| All the children are deserving of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| I also know that from the schools that I have visited where there have been renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| such as Beaumont and some of the other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| the renovations have been absolutely fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| And in many cases, it looks like a totally different school when you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:15| So I do have the faith that you will do a first-class job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8295)|
| 2:18:22| that the renovations done will be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| and that it will be a beautiful and safe learning environment for the children of Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8305)|
| 2:18:33| I also believe that not just for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| but all the renovations that you've got planned at other schools will also follow your tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| of coming in on budget and doing what needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| and creating the kind of environment that we all want for our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| for all of our children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| So I wish that we had enough money to build brand-new schools all over Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8334)|
| 2:19:05| but also I'm concerned about the blighted facilities when they're vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8345)|
| 2:19:12| It creates a huge drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| I really think that the school board deserves our support in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| and I don't see it as an either-or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| I think that in supporting the school board's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| it also is supporting the children in the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| as well as the children and the parents in the other communities in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| who are also deserving of renovations to their schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8376)|
| 2:19:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| Commissioner Boyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| One question that I have, the word was mentioned one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| but we haven't gotten back around to it, and that's the famous word mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| From what I understand, as far as the federal government is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8398)|
| 2:20:05| that's more serious than what the asbestos is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| So what's the mold situation at Carter Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Again, the statement I made earlier was that we are not aware of any significant active environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| That comes from Ms. Julie Thompson, who's the principal of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| and also from Rob Riley, who's here, who is our environmental engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| Have we had minor mold issues in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| Sure, and we've dealt with those, and we've taken care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| At the moment, my understanding is we don't have any significant active environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| I'd like to begin by thanking Superintendent McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| He was very kind and courteous to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:08| and gave me probably more time than a commissioner deserved in our meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| We had a discussion in depth, probably over two hours, I guess it was, we talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:23| on behalf of Carter Elementary School and on behalf of what we agreed to disagree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:31| And unfortunately, we're going to agree to disagree as we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8491)|
| 2:21:40| There are a lot of issues that he and I discussed that I will not discuss today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8500)|
| 2:21:47| But I will bring out the idea of a new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8507)|
| 2:21:54| because with the money and the budget that we have in place for the Carter project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8514)|
| 2:22:02| and the Sandy Loy issue, there's been some misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:09| I truly believe that some of the information that's been published is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| It's not only that I truly believe that it's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| I know absolutely that it is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| The actual cost per square foot on the Union County School is $82 a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8542)|
| 2:22:29| Got it confirmed this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| And the project cost pops up $103 with the land included in site preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:39| But the actual facility itself is $4.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| It's 55,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| It's about 12,000 bigger than the Carter School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| We could build a new school in the Carter community, as we just said, for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:57| We can expand the square footage for our kids from the 1930s model to about 74 square feet a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8577)|
| 2:23:05| We can have a clean, healthy environment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| We can bring them state-of-the-art education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| We can put our first-class teachers, our first-class curriculum, our first-class world in a first-class school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:20| I know the history of Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8600)|
| 2:23:30| I also know how the repairs of Carter Elementary School have been made in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| I know that we have heating and air conditioning problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| I know that our kids have sat in class with coats on just to try to study and stay warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| I also know that the sewer system issue was not just a backup stuff-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| I know that we've replaced sewer lines in the walls where they were deteriorated and decayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| and that's what happened to cause a flush down some of the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| I'm not just talking about in the laboratories downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| I know that our kids have been in there at times where they can't use the bathrooms, have to go upstairs because things aren't working right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:10| I hate to admit it, and, you know, when the hair turns gray and starts turning loose and age gets on things, a lot of things just don't work right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:21| And eventually we just get wore out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| And I can go to the doctor 50,000 times and take the shots and the vitamins, but in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| there's going to come a time when, you know, Bud's irreparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| And based upon the history of Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| at one time we had a school board that said this was actually the best thing to do for Carter in its current condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| is that we build these people a new elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8686)|
| 2:24:56| That was the difference between one school board and another school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| The building hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| Carter Elementary School got to the top of the list on one occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| And for other reasons, it got bumped down and we built other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| We built schools that I'm not saying who built them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| but I do know that one of the schools that was built had a $6 million overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| Whether it's our one project or not, I don't know who built it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| I don't know who was in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| I'm just telling you the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| That would be a Carter Elementary School we wasted right then because we didn't get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8724)|
| 2:25:35| Dr. McIntyre and I talked on many issues during our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| I think it was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| I think it was a truthful meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| I think we were up front with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8743)|
| 2:25:50| I believe to a large degree part of the things that we discussed we were on at least close to even keel on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8750)|
| 2:25:58| The real issue at hand today, though, was the Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| They were at the top of the list because the board said they needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| They were at the top of the list again because the board said they needed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| and they needed it so bad the board said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| well, you know, we just need to buy some property for Carter Elementary School because it's that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| We need school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Then we had some other financial issues come up in Knox County, so we didn't get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| Now Carter Elementary School comes back and we decide, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| we need something done at Carter Elementary School because the building is just in bad shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| and we want the best for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| I do know we had a mold issue at Carter Elementary School, and I know we still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| There's no doubt in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| Because the reparation of that mold was let's scrape it off, wash it off, and paint it over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| That's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| I know we have asbestos in Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| and I know we haven't had a certified asbestos inspector go in there to determine what degree it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| whether it's friable or whether it's whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| I do know that to be a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| I'm not spinning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| I'm just saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| I do know that we have some potential sewage problems beyond what's in the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| but what's in the transportation issues out of the building and otherwise because they're old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8826)|
| 2:27:11| They're worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| I do know that bricks and mortar cost what bricks and mortar cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| but I do know we spend too much money on our schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:23| We can build a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| I was just told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| I didn't know that figure for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| I had it down to $5.6845 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| and then we could build it with a base core capacity of 750 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8853)|
| 2:27:39| That would take care of our kids, and they would have somewhere to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| and it would be a place to be proud of in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:47| We just disagree how our children should reach that same goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| and I think we talked about that, and I used the analogy in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| I said, Dr. McIntyre, both of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| believe that our children should be able to get to downtown Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| And during that meeting, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| the only difference is between my approach and your approach is we want most of the kids to ride in limousines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8884)|
| 2:28:11| or at least buses, but my kids out in Carter, they've got to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8891)|
| 2:28:23| Well, we've got an old tractor in the barn out there, and it's about to fall apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| and we're fixing to spend enough money to buy a brand new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| And all I'm asking the Knox County School Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| I hope still, my dear friend, Superintendent McIntyre, to let us buy a new tractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:45| and let us do the right thing for the kids in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| I'm not going to go down the rhetoric that I've been down before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| but I do think as a county commission we do have a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8933)|
| 2:29:00| And if we're in within a million or $2 million of repairing an old car that might break down at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:08| because things that are unknown or buying a new car for almost the same amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8948)|
| 2:29:17| I personally believe it would be irresponsible on our part as county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| and our fiduciary duties to the Knox County citizens to budget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8962)|
| 2:29:36| I looked at what we have had offered on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| What we're going to get for our money is we're going to move an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| We're going to move a media center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| We're going to add four tables to the cafeteria and 15 feet of rail so our kids can go to lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:57| We're going to add an elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| And if the heat and air will work in the gymnasium, maybe we'll add some of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| We're going to get rid of our outside, I call them outhouses, but flat tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| And we're going to make space available from existing rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9011)|
| 2:30:16| But I've been in the office and they're barely big enough to be a bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| It's not a classroom, so we're not really creating two new classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| but moving one of the most precious professional quality principals in our school system into a new complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9023)|
| 2:30:36| I'm going to bring up one other thing, and I'm not going to speak to it in specifics, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9036)|
| 2:30:47| but I am going to implore you to consider the discussion one more time, just between me and you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9047)|
| 2:30:58| You know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| I still think it's the right thing to do for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| I think it's the right thing to do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| I think that we can take this $25 million budget, that's what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9067)|
| 2:31:13| between the Southwest Elementary School and the Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| I think we can look at those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| I think we can build two elementary schools out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:36| I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| And as I said when I was campaigning against my dear friend and colleague across the aisle over there, Commissioner Shouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9099)|
| 2:31:49| I said the people in West Knoxville need new schools because they're stacked on top of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| But the people in East Knox County need new schools because the schools are stacked on top of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| They're falling down around their ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| So you just can't talk about growth being the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| I'm going to support Commissioner Hammond's bifurcation of this capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| I really wish that he would bifurcate both schools to give you an opportunity to come back with a plan like we talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9137)|
| 2:32:27| But I think that we deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| I think it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| I really do, Doc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| From the bottom of my heart, I think it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9152)|
| 2:32:40| We really want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| And you're saying, you know, you want it done this way, and I'm saying I want it done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| And the board is saying they want it done your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| Commission, I hope, will say they want it done somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| But the community that is paying the freight, which is Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| and the community which will be riding in this facility, whatever it is, they've asked me to ask you to give them a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9181)|
| 2:33:13| So that's what I'm doing tonight on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:21| And I think that it is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:26| That school has asbestos problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| It has mold problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| It has electrical problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| It has heating air problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| It has water and moisture problems and humidity problems that are ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9215)|
| 2:33:43| We almost have a swimming pool at times in one end of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| Have to run dehumidifiers all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| We have families in our community that don't go to that school because of their children's sensitivity to the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9232)|
| 2:34:00| I mean, there's just a lot of things out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| And we're so close on this budget to a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| I just cannot fathom in my mind why we cannot and why the board would not be willing to build this community a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9245)|
| 2:34:15| based upon the facts that they can be built for the budgets that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9255)|
| 2:34:23| And as we've talked about building schools, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| you know that when it comes to building schools, this isn't my first rodeo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| And we had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| And I truly believe that we deserve a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| that we in Knox County for the Budget of the Corridor Plan can have a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| Two other school boards said we needed a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9286)|
| 2:34:52| And I'm just going to implore you to give the corridor community the new school that they need and that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9292)|
| 2:35:00| And I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9300)|
| 2:35:21| Okay, we're going to keep moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| Yeah, I'm really not going to speak too much about, you know, whether the corridor should have a new school or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| But I would like to speak just to the relationship between the school board, the county commission, and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:42| As you know, the school board is a democratically elected body, you know, by the citizens, just like this county commission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:51| Their mission is to look at the facilities, to look at what it takes to educate the children in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9351)|
| 2:36:00| Part of what I've been, I guess you'd say, disturbed about, not only in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| but also last month when we were having, or the month before when we were having the budget discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9365)|
| 2:36:11| is that we had people on the county commission talking about what kind of cars that the school people should drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| who should be hired, how many secretaries, and, you know, and many other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9377)|
| 2:36:22| that I personally think we probably don't have any business talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9382)|
| 2:36:28| Tonight we've been talking about what kind of elevators we're going to put in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| who's going to build the new school, how much he's going to cost to build the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| and I really think we're starting to cross the line on what the responsibilities and duties are of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| and what are the responsibilities and duties of the board of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| If we're going to be up here talking about what color paint to be put on the walls of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| why do we even need to have a board of education? I mean, why do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9412)|
| 2:36:56| I mean, and it's not like this is an appointed committee. This is an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| And I think for us to try to overly manage the school system is really subverting democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9422)|
| 2:37:09| because this was a democratically elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| What they have to look at and really what we have to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| and I'm not even going to comment about the particularities of the schools because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| Carter needs something done, and I'm going to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| They need something done, and I think the county needs to provide the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| to get it back to being a healthy and safe learning environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| But we have to look at the bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| One of the things, and this is the only comment I'm going to make about the schools themselves at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| other than what I talked about what I think is the proper relationship between the county commission and the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:46| is that there indeed are 14 schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| I'm not going to count intermediate or high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| There's 14 elementary schools in Knox County that are older, and I'd be glad to read those to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| if you don't believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| Eleven of those schools have had renovations, or Carter has had a major renovation more recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9480)|
| 2:38:07| than 11 of those 14 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| I mean, if we want to build schools for all of those that are older, that are older than Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9490)|
| 2:38:19| and older since their most recent major renovation, we need to put another $70 million in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9499)|
| 2:38:29| I mean, we're really supposed to be looking at the big picture, and that does not take away one bit from Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| I know Commissioner Lutho has some concerns that when we start the renovations, we may run over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| If we find out that we need to put more money into it once the renovation started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| if that's what we indeed decide to do, I personally don't think that we should be deciding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| This argument should have been occurring with all the people out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| and I really do appreciate everyone for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| This argument should have been in front of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| And the school board, from what I understand, voted unanimously to go ahead with their capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9535)|
| 2:39:00| looking at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| And just one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| You know, we put off so many decisions, we're almost becoming an object of community ridicule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9546)|
| 2:39:11| I mean, if we want to go ahead and vote down the budget we have, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| If we want to go ahead tonight and vote money, which I assume, because I don't think we can direct it directly to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| I think that's the, or to a particular school, I think that's the school board's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| Let's go ahead and do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| You know, I just don't want to put things off forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| But I do want to speak in support of the school board and that I do respect the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| I do respect the democratic process, because they are a democratically elected body by the citizens of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9574)|
| 2:39:42| whose charge is to be certain that our kids have their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9582)|
| 2:39:47| And I respect the job that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9587)|
| 2:39:53| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| First of all, I want to thank everybody in Carter being concerned like they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| I wish the people in the ninth district would like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| I'm going to have to agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| This should have been taken before the school board and tried to put in the capital plan before it came here to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9606)|
| 2:40:12| Everybody up here would like to build a new school like Ms. Bross said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9612)|
| 2:40:17| Now, we have two in South Knoxville that are quite a bit older than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| and they haven't had any renovations since 1960 and where Carter had it in 83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9621)|
| 2:40:26| Now, I'd like to ask Doug a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| I guess Doug could probably answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| Doug, if you had the funds to build a new school, how long do you think it would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| To design and build a new elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| Between 18 and 24 months total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| Between 18 and 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9651)|
| 2:40:52| Would the people out here in the audience, would you be willing to go without any kind of renovations or anything for 24 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| if we could build a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9658)|
| 2:41:04| I'm taking it that you would agree to do without any renovations for 24 months if we could get a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| Commissioner Hammond says that they can build a school for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9670)|
| 2:41:15| Well, the thing about it is I don't hardly believe they can the way he's asking them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:21| He's asking the school board to come up with some cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| Now, if they come up with cuts to get this $5 million, then to build this new school with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| they're going to rob some other district of some needs they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9691)|
| 2:41:36| So I'd like to ask Commissioner Hammond, first I'd like to ask Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9696)|
| 2:41:43| We've got too many doctors up here, Dr. Briggs and Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| Dr. McIntyre, with 24 months and you're spending approximately $5 million up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9708)|
| 2:41:57| do you think that you can build a school if we've got bids for it for $5 million that that would be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9717)|
| 2:42:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| What I'm trying to say really, would that bother your capital plan is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| Well, if you didn't have to come up with this $5 million for the capital plan in two years up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| it's going to take us 24 months to build that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| Would that hurt you in any other areas in your capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| Well, I guess let me answer this in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| I think it's very easy for us to be up here this evening and throw out numbers of what we think it might cost for a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9751)|
| 2:42:38| I'm really not convinced that we can build a new school that meets our educational specifications for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9758)|
| 2:42:44| I would like to, you know, we've been doing this a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| As Commissioner Boyle said, we have some experience around building schools since we've done that quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9768)|
| 2:42:55| And while we're open to looking at designs, in fact, we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| we're in the process of beginning to design a school for the southwest sector of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| While we're open to looking at various designs, I'm not convinced that we can build a new school for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| And as Mr. Troy said earlier, any additional fiscal impact on the capital budget has a fiscal impact on our general fund budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9791)|
| 2:43:22| And as you all know, from the discussion that we had, we're extraordinarily tight on our general fund budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9802)|
| 2:43:29| We got some good news recently with the end of legislative session and the state budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9809)|
| 2:43:34| to be able to help us restore some of the positions that we had cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9814)|
| 2:43:38| But we're, you know, we're in the position where we're literally trading off teacher positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| if we're adding any more additional expenditure obligations to our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| So I'm not convinced that that is a viable option for us in terms of some of the figures that have just been thrown out this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9827)|
| 2:43:55| And I think anything that we put in terms of additional expenditures on the capital plan has an implication for the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9835)|
| 2:44:04| which is already extraordinarily tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| But now you have to realize these people here have agreed to do without any kind of renovations for two years if they get a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9847)|
| 2:44:16| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| Now I'm asking the audience that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| Now, in this $5 million you were spending, some things weren't going to be done that didn't come out of this $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9859)|
| 2:44:28| Am I not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| Did you not say, like, the roof and a few more things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9869)|
| 2:44:33| And they've agreed to do without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| I want you to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| That's that much more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| But what I'm trying to say is I don't think they can build that school for $5 million either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| But there is a possibility that they might be able to build this school for $7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9884)|
| 2:44:53| with the money that you're not going to use to do things that weren't in this capital plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9893)|
| 2:44:59| So, really, you're going to be talking about close to $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| Do you follow what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| No, Commissioner, I'm not sure I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9905)|
| 2:45:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| I believe somebody gave a roof figure here a while ago and another figure of about $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| Do you have those down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| A quarter of a million dollars and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| These people are willing to do without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| So that's another quarter of a million dollars you have right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| And what I'm saying is, if you could take this $5 million in the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| I realize it's coming in in two years, but Doug says it will be two years before we can build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| I don't think this county commission should ask the school board to come up with any more money than the $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9935)|
| 2:45:43| I think that we should come up with a difference up to $7 million, and that would give you roughly pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9943)|
| 2:45:50| You're going to be talking about $8 million, roughly, to build this school with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9950)|
| 2:45:56| I've lost you again, I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| Well, Commissioner, I guess what I'd like to say at this point is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| you and I can have a conversation or Commissioner Armstrong and I can have a conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| but ultimately the body that is authorized to make these decisions is the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:14| And they have had a public process by which they have made this assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| They have made their decision around what their adopted capital improvement plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| They are seeking appropriation from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| And so, you know, any conversation along the lines of what you're talking about has to be a conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9990)|
| 2:46:37| and among the Board of Education, and I can't make commitments in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| I agree with you 100 percent, and I'm not asking you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| And personally, I don't like this kind of politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| I think this is worsening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| If you don't do this, I'm not going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| I don't like this kind of politics we're going through up here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| But what I'm asking you is, could we vote for your capital plan, pull this out, the Carter Elementary deal out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10013)|
| 2:47:02| until you all can come back with what it would cost to build a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:10| and if the county come up with a difference, up to $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10030)|
| 2:47:16| Again, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| I realize the school board is going to have to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| The board is going to have to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| Again, I don't have, you know, again, it's very easy for us to stand up here and throw out figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| Again, I'm not convinced an additional $2 million would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| I don't know that, short of stepping back and doing some additional planning around what a new facility would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10050)|
| 2:47:37| I'm very skeptical of the figures that have been thrown out here tonight, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:41| because we have specific educational specifications that speak to spaces for things like special education and art and music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10061)|
| 2:47:49| and other things, and we want to make sure that any facility that we build, you know, has those specifications taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10069)|
| 2:47:57| So I'm not sure I can answer your question standing here up in front of you this evening, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10077)|
| 2:48:02| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10082)|
| 2:48:03| But would you be willing to let us vote for the rest of the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10083)|
| 2:48:08| I mean, I know you can't make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| We can make that decision ourselves, pull that out if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| My understanding, Commissioner, of what you can vote on is the appropriation level for the capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:22| I don't think we can build this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| Not specifically what's included or not included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| I don't think we can build this school for less than $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| But if we're trying to tell you what you have to do, I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| If we're trying to tell you what we have to do, you've only got $5 million to work with in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| This body right here needs to come up with the funding for that instead of asking you to go back and cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| So I don't know what else to say, but how long do you think, Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10131)|
| 2:48:57| how long do you think it would take to get bids on building a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10137)|
| 2:49:04| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10144)|
| 2:49:12| Commissioner, from a design standpoint, we're probably looking at six to seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| And then from the procurement aspect, it has to be on the streets for a minimum of 21 days for the bidding period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10157)|
| 2:49:24| So basically you're looking at somewhere in the eight to nine month range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10164)|
| 2:49:29| And that designing prospect includes the 24 months you were talking about, too, about building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10173)|
| 2:49:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| I'm afraid we're setting a precedent here, and I know it sounds like I'm talking in all kinds of circles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10178)|
| 2:49:43| but I want to see these people get a school, but I know the school board doesn't have the money to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10183)|
| 2:49:49| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10189)|
| 2:49:50| And it's easy for us to sit up here and say for you to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10190)|
| 2:49:53| I feel like you've cut as much as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| I think you've done everything possible this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| It's been a tight budget for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| But if we're going to dictate a new school for you up there, we've got to have a way to come up with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10201)|
| 2:50:07| Would you people be willing to wait the six or seven months before we voted on giving any money up there at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10207)|
| 2:50:16| until they come back and give us a price on this school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10216)|
| 2:50:19| Now, when they come back, if they come back, I want you to realize if it's up there $15 million or better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10219)|
| 2:50:26| the county may not be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| We may have to go with this capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10227)|
| 2:50:35| Nobody's for that, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10235)|
| 2:50:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| Well, if anybody has any suggestion how Knox County can come up with the money, I'd like to know right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10239)|
| 2:50:46| John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10246)|
| 2:50:57| John, we've been in the hole the last three years on our budget here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| When we come back, we have to take money even after it's appropriated out of the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| How much shortage do you think we're going to have this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10263)|
| 2:51:11| Shortage, I think we're going to come out slightly better than what we budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| You think our revenues are going to be more than our expenditures for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10275)|
| 2:51:22| When you consider where we expected to be and what our actual revenues and our actual expenditures will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10282)|
| 2:51:30| I think we'll be just slightly better than what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10297)|
| 2:51:40| I'm awake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10300)|
| 2:51:41| Oh, I thought you were sleeping there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| If you're the one that comes up and wants to build this school, how do you think we need to get the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| Well, my resolution, by the way, I was not the one who threw out the $5 million figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10312)|
| 2:51:53| I just wanted to make sure that was my colleague, Mr. Lambert, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| What I'm suggesting is let's pass the capital plan without Carter and then let's talk about it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10315)|
| 2:52:01| Let's find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| I don't have an answer tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| That's what I've been trying to say, but only we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| And again, I'm for the new school, but I've also said let's look at the renovation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| Do we need a couple of million more for renovation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10330)|
| 2:52:13| I'll do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| I think we need to sit down and talk about it with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| and let's have a good discussion on what do we need to do, and that's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10336)|
| 2:52:22| Well, I think Knox County needs to come up with the money for them, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| whether it's more money for renovations or a new school instead of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| Well, now, are you making a proposal that then we go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| You're making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| My substitute motion is that we approve the capital plan minus the money that would be designated for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10355)|
| 2:52:41| Let's sit down with the school board over the next 30 days and see what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| We may come back and say there are no options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| I think there are, but also I recognize the fact, as Mr. McIntyre has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| we can't tell them how to spend their money, and so we're just going to appropriate dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| And if they want to go ahead with Carter, I mean, they can go ahead and do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| but I think that the sentiment here is that amount of money is let's hold that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10378)|
| 2:53:03| and let's talk about it and let's see if there are some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| I can go along with that, but in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| I don't think we need to be trying to get some kind of bids on this school or something to see where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10388)|
| 2:53:16| Commissioner Pinkston, Mr. Chairman, could I have an opportunity to address the commission since I'm the chairman of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10396)|
| 2:53:23| and we're discussing the board's authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:30| First, I want to thank Commissioner Briggs, Pinkston, Commissioner Royals and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10410)|
| 2:53:36| for raising the very important point that you all are the funding body and we decide how to spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| If you all appropriated $15 million, the board may say that the priority this year is to allocate 100 percent of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10421)|
| 2:53:50| to spending down our debt obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10430)|
| 2:53:53| And believe me, we need that $15 million just to cover our ongoing debt financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10433)|
| 2:53:58| But the board has said, no, this is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| We do have these ongoing debt obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| It is eating into our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| But we have some things that we need to do to maintain the facilities in which our children learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10445)|
| 2:54:11| And my own children attend a school that's as old as Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| And it's been renovated and it's a good school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| And I think that it's very important everybody in this room agrees that there are deficiencies at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10457)|
| 2:54:24| Everyone agrees about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| What I would ask commissioners to think about is you should go visit the schools that have been renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10466)|
| 2:54:34| Powell Middle School, Holston Middle School, Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| I mean, there's dozens and dozens of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| And when I visit those schools, I see that they're very well done, that the communities are very pleased with the results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10480)|
| 2:54:47| and that the Knox County Schools and Knox County Board of Education has an excellent track record on doing these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10487)|
| 2:54:53| on time, under budget, and getting great results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10493)|
| 2:54:56| And there's no reason that you shouldn't trust the same that will be true for Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10496)|
| 2:55:01| To me, your choice tonight is not whether or not to build a new school or renovate the existing school at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| That's not your decision. That's our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| Your vote tonight is you can support our capital plan and guarantee that Carter Elementary School will get fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10509)|
| 2:55:16| and get a high-quality renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| Or you can vote against our capital project and guarantee that they'll be in limbo for an indefinite amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10518)|
| 2:55:25| I mean, those are the – well, I'm not saying – it's just that I can't speak for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10525)|
| 2:55:33| There's going to be at least four new members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| But in the past, even in our most recent vote, I think all nine of us were persuaded in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10535)|
| 2:55:42| by the commentary of the people from Carter who are tired of waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| You know, they're tired of waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| And I understand that they've been over-promising in the past by previous leaders in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10548)|
| 2:55:55| And that is regrettable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| But two wrongs do not make a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| And I think when we think about building new versus renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10558)|
| 2:56:02| we have to be fiscally responsible stewards of the properties that we already own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10562)|
| 2:56:07| And just abandoning them every time that they need to be fixed is not fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| And that's not been our practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| And I would encourage you to consider that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| And I'm not closed-minded about considering other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10579)|
| 2:56:24| but I would never support building a school for the students of Carter that was lower standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10584)|
| 2:56:33| than the standards that we supply for the rest of our students across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| And that's where I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| You know, you can slap something up there for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| But what will the quality be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| And what will the duration of it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| Would we be, you know, you've mentioned, Commissioner Luthold and others have mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10606)|
| 2:56:50| we don't want a Band-Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| We want a long-term solution, 30, 40, 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10611)|
| 2:56:56| And that's what the school board wants too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| And that's what I would expect the community to want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| A slapdash building, even if it's new, that's not built to last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10620)|
| 2:57:04| is not in the taxpayer's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| It's not in the student's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| It'll be shiny new for a couple years, and then, you know, who knows how long it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10628)|
| 2:57:13| if it's not built in the high-quality fashion that we demand for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10633)|
| 2:57:19| So, you know, I hope you'll consider this when you vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10639)|
| 2:57:24| because, you know, I'm not against Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10644)|
| 2:57:29| I'm for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| I think this is a good plan that will help Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| and you can vote tonight to make it happen, and I hope you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| You know, I think we're in agreement with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| What I was trying to do was reach an agreement between everybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| trying to help everybody get this problem behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| But that school up there, when you go up there and build a new one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| if you renovate this school, it'll probably be standing when that new one's falling down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| the way things were built to this day and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| Well, it may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| It may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628part2?start=10675)|
