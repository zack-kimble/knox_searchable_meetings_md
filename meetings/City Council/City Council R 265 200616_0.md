| 0:06:07| It's agenda item 12 be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| I sent an email to finance to get more information on the different capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=373)|
| 0:06:27| and because of our system being down, they were not able to send me that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| And we've had discussion previously about one of the projects having additional funds available for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=394)|
| 0:06:43| And I thought it would be good for us to understand to know the funds available for all of these projects so we have the full picture of that five year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=403)|
| 0:06:53| Motion made to postpone item 12 be by council member Parker. Is there a second to this motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=413)|

| 0:07:08| Usually give a specific timeframe. When you move to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| I believe, since the issue is only the system being down, we should be able to get that information by our next meeting so for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=433)|
| 0:07:26| Okay motion made to postpone item 12 be for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| Motion made by Councilmember Parker seconded by Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| I would like to just ask Mr. Evans, if there any, any reasons that this would, you know, any time sensitivity to this, or Miss Miss writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=456)|
| 0:07:48| Do you have a question or comment along the same line I want to ask Mr sponsor Mr frost what the charter requirements where we have specific requirements about passing the capital improvements budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=468)|
| 0:07:59| and I don't remember what that specifically is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| Mr Swanson. Yes, we do have to pass capital improvements budget, but we do have another meeting in June, get accomplished by the end of June will be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=484)|
| 0:08:16| So, as I recall the next meeting is as long as it's addressed by June 30 I think we'll be all right with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=496)|
| 0:08:26| That would be our first reading right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| If we postpone it would be on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| We might ask for a motion to do it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| We would need to do it on emergency right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Any, any other information from staff, you know, law or finance that we need that council members need to know before voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=524)|
| 0:08:57| Ma'am boy sevens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Yeah, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| I guess the only thing I would say that this is a planning document planning type ordinance, and not a budgetary monetary type ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=542)|
| 0:09:15| In other words, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| counsel is already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| The first year capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| These other five years here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| It does not reflect any intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| You know, if you approve it, there's no monetary effect it doesn't doesn't go into effect that just says that would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=577)|
| 0:09:48| But if we had, we may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| The main reason this has to be sent to capital Knoxville Knox planning commission is that it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=592)|
| 0:10:05| They have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| They know how to work with the various developers, you know what the potential plans are and so forth, particularly for this year, but also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=608)|
| 0:10:21| Like I say, it's a planning document, it's not a budget document, you're not allocating money out years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=621)|
| 0:10:32| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you, Mr Evans council member saying, thank you. Is this one of the items we often refer to as housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| I don't know that it's housekeeping but it's kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| It's the formality, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| The main thing has already been done, which is as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| the year, the capital improvement plan, which for 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| This is just that the planning has reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| They are good with, with that doc with the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| Like I say, so it's a formality, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| May I withdraw my second I don't know about procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| Yeah, you may withdraw your second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Back to the original motion to postpone for two weeks by council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| Is there a second second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| Okay, seeing no second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| We don't move forward with that so back, back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| any other items for postponement that council wants to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| Postpone any items to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| Okay, and consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| Is there a motion on consent or, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Is there anybody who wanted to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| I know Mr Swanson Could you advise me I think there was a consent item that we may need to need to postpone for legal legality reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=744)|
| 0:12:37| Okay, about whether they had been administratively dissolved I talked with council's attorney about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| There was some reason to suspect that there was an administrative dissolution of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=763)|
| 0:12:53| And so that it could not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| But it could not be distributed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Let me ask Mr Frost about that whether that's been resolved yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Yes, the internal auditor contacted the organization, the organization got back in the good graces of the Tennessee Secretary of State and I confirmed that on the Secretary of State's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=782)|
| 0:13:14| So they are eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Passing that on I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| So, is there a motion on the consent approval to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| Approval of the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Motion made to approve the consent items by Councilmember if you get seconded by Councilmember Roberto any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=812)|

| 0:13:59| Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Councilman writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=844)|

| 0:14:31| Okay council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Bear with me a little bit I'm using a different computers and usual. And so, I, you know, so just appreciate your patience as I navigate this so anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=873)|
| 0:14:44| Good to see everybody council members and thank you to everyone watching from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| This week marks my six month anniversary serving as the mayor of the city of Knoxville and everything has gone just as I expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=891)|
| 0:15:01| But anyhow, despite the significant challenges we face, I'm very honored to be Knoxville's mayor and grateful to have the opportunity to work with all of you to lead our city through these tumultuous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=901)|
| 0:15:15| So I'm going to first talk about bring you up to speed on the cyber attack on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| As you know, late last week, the city of Knoxville experienced a malware event that resulted in the disruption of certain services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| We immediately took steps to respond to the issue and that response is ongoing. We are working diligently to restore our systems to full functionality with the assistance of industry experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=929)|
| 0:15:40| We will continue to work with our residents and remain committed to ensuring prompt delivery of city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| We will keep everyone up to date on this investigation investigation as definitive information becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| I want to thank our chief technology officer, Mark Parker, and his entire team for the around the clock work they've been doing to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=952)|
| 0:16:01| They've handled it expertly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| The next subject I wanted to discuss is about police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| I want to update you on our ongoing efforts with Chief Thomas and KPD to review policies and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| A few weeks ago, I pledged via the My Brother's Keeper Alliance to take a comprehensive and collaborative approach to reviewing police practices and reimagining public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=977)|
| 0:16:29| That pledge commits to a thorough look internally and with community members, and I want to thank everybody who's reached out to share their concerns and their suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=989)|
| 0:16:39| Chief Thomas and I are actively working to review and reform as necessary our use of force policy, beginning with the eight can't wait, eight specific use of force policies that can reduce police violence by 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=999)|
| 0:16:53| KPD has already adopted the majority of the recommended practices and policies, and we'll be making additional updates where needed to reflect all of the eight can't wait best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| We also know, however, that nationally, some of the flaws in policing reflect deep rooted issues that have been centuries in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1021)|
| 0:17:11| Generational poverty, systemic racism, disparities and opportunity, lack of a robust social safety net, among many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1031)|
| 0:17:20| Like teachers, police officers are often expected to solve problems that are far outside the traditional realm of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| They respond to the 911 calls that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Last year, there were more than 275,000 calls, and they respond regardless of whether that call would have been better suited for a social worker, a mental health professional, or even a marriage counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1050)|
| 0:17:43| Our officers do a remarkable job, and they serve an absolutely critical role in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| But I'm a firm believer that there's always room for improvement, and our law enforcement systems are no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| We have an opportunity, and I'd argue an obligation, to take a comprehensive look at public safety in Knoxville, not only to consider where KPD policies and practices can be strengthened, but also how law enforcement functions as one piece of a larger public safety system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1074)|
| 0:18:11| This is not a quick conversation, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| It must be intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| It must reflect not only national best practices, but also meaningful community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| We need to take the time to take it, to get it right, to find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| And I know many council members have been meeting with people and thinking about solutions and discussing some of those ideas with me, including future conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1103)|
| 0:18:33| So we need to find solutions, both short and long term, that work for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Chief Thomas and I are committed to that conversation and to exploring these issues together as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Last, I wanted to talk on COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| COVID-19, the pandemic is still very real, and we each have a responsibility to mitigate the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| As of today, we have 102 active cases in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| That number is four times we were seeing at the beginning of May, and these numbers are concerning and certainly give me pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| Also, I know that some surrounding counties have had a recent uptick, and the COVID virus does not stop at county boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| So I want to thank, again, the Knox County Health Department for their rigorous efforts to offer robust testing and tracking of the spread of the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1154)|
| 0:19:23| If you want to get tested, you can go down to the health department any Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| That's at 140 Dameron Avenue off of Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| You don't need an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| There's no cost to the people getting the test, and it's open to everyone, whether you have symptoms or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| And you can call 215-5555 if you have any specific questions about COVID issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| So we will be looking to the health department's guidance as we consider how to proceed as a city and as a community in the coming weeks and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1187)|
| 0:19:56| The Knox County Board of Health meets tomorrow, June 17th, at 5 p.m., with an agenda focusing on the reopening plan and associated benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1196)|
| 0:20:05| It'll be broadcast on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| Okay, so that concludes my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Do any council members have reports to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Last week, I was happy to join the United Way in announcing the House Knox program for housing navigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1222)|
| 0:20:30| Anybody that cares about our affordable housing issue in Knoxville knows we need more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| But given the resources we have and the programs that are available, a lot of times they are open beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| And so those housing navigators at United Way will seek to identify open beds for people who need it, whether it's emergency housing or longer term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1244)|
| 0:20:55| So the program just launched last week, and they're going to have to figure some things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| But some of those housing navigators have been successful in other markets, other cities across our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| And it's a good addition to the services across our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| Their VMC, Salvation Army, and a number of agency partners are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| It's a good program, and we should all be proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| Hopefully, they can help us make a dent in the affordable housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| So I wanted to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Council Member Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| This week, you and I have spoken a great deal about police reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| I'm just going back to that to just stress how important it is and that I know you're not putting it to the side at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1301)|
| 0:21:50| But I think with so many people with such strong feelings right now, when do you think we're going to begin looking at the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1310)|
| 0:21:59| We cannot change the budget, but we can change other aspects of the police department this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| That's like five questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| You know, I just got a little indicator that my Internet connection is unstable, so I missed a little bit of what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1329)|
| 0:22:18| Could you just say, I mean, when are we going to get started on these discussions on reimagining public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1338)|
| 0:22:29| I have heard from council members, and I've heard from members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| This is an urgent matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| People are eager to start the discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| So I think that council members want to have, I think there's a workshop planned in the near future where council members are going to have an opportunity to work with Chief Thomas and some members of her senior leadership team on some specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1356)|
| 0:22:54| The issues are so broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| I think it's going to take multiple meetings, because it's about KPD first and foremost, but we also want to see what the capacities are for the fire department, how we might explore and build the capacity at the Family Justice Center and the BHUC and the mobile crisis unit and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1376)|
| 0:23:16| So I will work on this with my administration and come back with a proposal to council and share that with you in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1396)|
| 0:23:28| I don't have anything ready right now tonight, but I do share your urgency from every single council member and hundreds of emails and other ways the community is contacting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1408)|
| 0:23:41| I realize this is an urgent matter, and it's also an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| It's a rare opportunity where there's a lot of consensus to have this discussion and see how we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1425)|
| 0:23:56| So I don't have a specific timeframe in mind, and I welcome input from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| And also we'll come back to you all with a proposed framework for how we'll go about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| So I don't have any specifics right now tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| I wanted to give a report, and I'll start with the topics that Councilwoman Singh brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| And so hearing from several, multiple council members, specifically Councilwoman Singh and Councilmember Roberto, is where the thought process came into place that we should have a workshop with KPD, with Chief Thomas and some of her staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1461)|
| 0:24:38| So we will be soliciting specific areas that council members have an interest in looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| So, Mayor, we appreciate that you've gone ahead and you started some work and looking at some policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| I think that that will make for a more robust conversation because I think that we as council members, we don't necessarily, we want to collaborate and all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1488)|
| 0:24:59| So it could be that instead of you bringing something to look at, that we all will work on that together based on the preliminary work that you're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| So, council members, Mr. Johnson will be polling you guys for probably three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| We probably will need to break that up into three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| We will submit our specific areas of interest and probably will ask Mayor and Chief Thomas to get some policies maybe in advance for our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| So therefore, we will be able to have a more regularization of the time that we'll have together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| So please know, council members, that we will be busy in the coming weeks and months ahead to be able to aggressively look at some of the things that are going on in ways that we can contribute to improving those areas of reform in our Nassau Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1530)|
| 0:25:46| Mayor, if you will, I do want to remind everyone that Friday, June 19, is known as Juneteenth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| That is the holiday that's celebrated to commemorate the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| The holiday was first celebrated in Texas, where on that date in 1865, in the aftermath of the Civil War, slaves were declared free under the terms of the 1862 Emancipation Proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1560)|
| 0:26:13| There are several events that will be taking place on that date, which is this coming Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| The first of which will be the Beck Cultural Exchange Center under Reverend Renee Kessler's leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| She will be hosting a virtual town hall meeting from 4 to 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1583)|

| 0:26:32| She has a panel of Black leaders that will be discussing several different topics that will be germane to what's happening in the country and here locally today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1592)|
| 0:26:45| Also, there will be a Juneteenth Black Lives Matter rally that will be held at Castle Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| That will be from 6 until 9, and there will be a short march as well back to that starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1611)|

| 0:27:04| It is a Women's Heart to March Calling All Women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| It's a peace solidarity march in love and unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| It is organized by Zenobia Dobson and Terry Walker Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| That will be Thursday, June the 25th from 6 to 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Rain or shine, that march will start at the Civic Auditorium Coliseum, and they will march to the City-County Building Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1639)|
| 0:27:28| Then on June the 27th at 10 a.m., there will be a silent march that will start at the New Harvest Plaza in front of WJBE radio station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1648)|

| 0:27:45| This will be a women's march as well, where women will march to the Morningside Park and will then call the names of over 100 people who have lost their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1665)|
| 0:27:56| African American people have lost their lives in the last few years to violence and police violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1676)|
| 0:28:04| Then at 5.30 on June the 27th, there will be a I Am My Brother's Keeper Unity March that will be hosted by World United Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1684)|

| 0:28:32| That is a Unity March, where KPD officers have been invited to attend and march as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1712)|
| 0:28:41| And that is the end of my report. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie. Any other council members have reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| One thing to follow up on the discussion, I just wanted to clarify that the mayor can bring a budget amendment to us at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1733)|
| 0:29:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Also, I should report that the Knoxville Transportation Authority has not met essentially since the pandemic began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1750)|
| 0:29:23| And it looks like our June meeting is also going to be canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| And I do not know about our July meeting yet, but just an update that we have not met since I believe February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1767)|
| 0:29:37| But hopefully we'll begin meeting again soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Okay, thank you, Council Member Parker. Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| Okay, seeing none, we'll move on to the next agenda item. Mr. Johnson, could you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Sorry, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Mayor, I'm very sorry. I needed to add that on the Girl Trek walk, they do ask that people wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| And of course, we would encourage people to wear a mask at any public gathering, as you mentioned earlier, as it relates to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| So I did want to make sure that I said that because that is specifically indicated in their flyer and registration information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=1814)|

| 0:36:02| Council Members, you're very familiar with this. Appreciate your support of this at the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| As you know, I think establishing an HR is going to be a good thing for our city, for our residents, for our employees, and of course we will protect all the civil service protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| We have a number of people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| So we'll start with the public speakers and then move to any council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| First person signed up to speak is Robby Quorum. Mr. Quorum, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| I am, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| I just wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| State your name and address for the record. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Robert Quorum, 108 Oakwood Drive, Maynardville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| I just wanted to voice my support once again for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| I appreciate Council taking time to listen to everything that's been said and I appreciate the efforts the Mayor's put in, both Mayor Kincannon and Mayor O'Hara over the past 14 months that we've worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2211)|
| 0:37:05| I was in the original group working. I haven't had the pleasure of working with Mayor Kincannon outside of workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| But I do feel that this will help us better separate the powers with Council being the legislative branch, the Mayor being the executive, and then civil service serving as kind of our judiciary branch for city employees, protecting our rights as employees to the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2232)|
| 0:37:30| So I believe this better helps them serve the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| I just believe that it will help the city all together as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| So thank you for your consideration of it and I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| And once again, I would like to voice my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2266)|

| 0:38:07| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Mr. Taylor, if you could just identify, or Officer Taylor, Lieutenant, I'm not sure what your rank is, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| I'm just a cop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| I'm just a cop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Just a cop. Officer Taylor, if you could please just say your name and address for the record and then you have up to five minutes to speak to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| Thank you, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| My name is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| I am the immediate past president of the Fraternal Order of Police Volunteer Lodge No. 2, located at 720 North Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2315)|
| 0:38:46| And I want to speak in support of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| So, you know, I listened to a little bit of the conversation a few moments ago about ways to improve and different areas and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2331)|
| 0:39:01| And quite honestly, I get, you know, that I think that a lot of folks don't understand police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| And anytime we can increase dialogue and better educate folks, I know that that's something I always try to do when I have the opportunity to interact and explain why we do certain things and how we do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2349)|
| 0:39:22| And our logic behind it, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| And I think that an HR department, quite honestly, would help us with some of those communications between police officers and our elected officials and our policymakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2365)|
| 0:39:42| So a lot of times in the current system, I have felt while acting as the FOP president that, you know, I couldn't really get the importance or emphasize enough some of the trends that I saw happening in the marketplace and in the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2382)|
| 0:40:01| And so that's been hard for me to swallow over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| And I think that HR serves a critical role in that because they're kind of exclusively responsible in most organizations for those very functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2408)|
| 0:40:21| Getting organizations the resources they need, helping them attract those resources, getting them the best training, the best policies in order to be effective, and creating, quite honestly, the conditions under which they can be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2421)|
| 0:40:34| So just like those conversations we were talking about between the community and police and leadership, I think that HR is a necessary thing in the current marketplace to achieve those functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2434)|
| 0:40:51| Is that almost equated to, like, if the city actions with the police department were a jetliner, it'd be like we had the 737 on cruise control because we've done it a certain way and it worked for so long on recruiting people and retaining people and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2451)|
| 0:41:10| And so, you know, at some point the pilot went missing there and the planes carried on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| But we're in bad weather and we've taken it really rough over the last several years and we have to do something to turn that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| And I think HR would be a good way to start doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| I think it's going to be critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| It's almost like we're flying blind right now, in my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| So I hope the council seriously considers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| I think the time to act was several years ago and we're already at a big disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| So I hope we act without delay on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And I fully support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Thank you for your time and thanks for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you, Officer Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Next person signed up to speak is Larry McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| Mr. McAfee, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| I don't see him, but there are several telephone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| So if Mr. McAfee will raise his hand by hitting star 9 on his receiver, we could see that he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| And someone has raised their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Okay, Mr. McAfee, could you start by stating your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2543)|
| 0:42:30| And then you'll have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Yes, my name is Larry McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| My address is 3333 Cleaver Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| I'm the Vice President of the Knoxville Firefighter Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| Knoxville Firefighter Association is in favor of the Mayor's HR department and the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| Initially, we had some reservations due to some of the language that was in within the ordinance and some of the language that was missing from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2572)|
| 0:43:02| The Mayor and her team has worked diligently to address some of the questions and concerns that was brought forth by the workshops that was held throughout one of the many work groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2582)|
| 0:43:14| So I'd like to say thank you, Mayor, and thank you to the team for working with us and trying to address some of our concerns as far as the HR department goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2594)|
| 0:43:24| Like Officer Taylor said, somewhere along the lines, there has been a disconnect between civil service and their responsibilities and their role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2604)|
| 0:43:35| Throughout this process, we've heard how much their duties are HR related duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| Well, as an employee, I feel like we need an advocate for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| And that's what we felt the civil service department was for, the advocacy group for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| So with the creation of the HR department, I hope that the civil service board can focus more on their duties and become more of an advocate for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Next person signed up to speak is Jamie Ballinger, the chair of the civil service board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| Ms. Ballinger, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Please start by saying your name and address for the record and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I'm Jamie Ballinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| My address is 1205 Luttrell Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| As most of council knows, I have the honor of chairing the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| That is a five person board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| We each serve a five year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| We are appointed by the mayor of Knoxville and confirmed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| I know you guys have a lot on your plate these days, so I will really quickly walk through procedurally what the civil service merit board has been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2690)|
| 0:45:00| And as you will recall, on May 13th of this year, we reviewed this proposed ordinance in front of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| Now, we reviewed the April 28th, 2020 version of that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| And after a lengthy meeting, the majority of our board elected to oppose that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| It's my understanding that since that time, the ordinance has been revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| That ordinance was presented to council for a first reading on June 2nd of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| And then civil service merit board, we met again last week on June 10th of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| The new revised ordinance was not on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| But what was on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| And so the board did not make a point of saying that we have not reviewed as a board together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| The revised joint ordinance, but what was on our agenda was a concern that the civil service merit board would need to pursue litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2759)|
| 0:46:12| Against the city for some concerns regarding issues that the ordinance might pose with the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2772)|
| 0:46:21| And also some functionality issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Civil service merit board on June 10th, we debated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| And the board elected to vote to ask this body to defer voting on the ordinance to and send this matter to workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2788)|
| 0:46:39| To allow us to continue to address some parts of the ordinance that we fear create some functional hurdles to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2799)|
| 0:46:49| And perhaps some charter issues to us fulfilling our duty as an advocate to protect merit principles in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| I've also asked, as you guys are aware that Mike Winchester join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| Mike Winchester is legal counsel to the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| And he can speak to the issue spotting we have done with this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| Again, our job is the civil service merit board is to make sure that merit based principles and Knoxville are here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2833)|
| 0:47:21| And that we hire and promote on the basis of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| So we are committed to doing that and we want to avoid any scuffles in the future and whatever we can do to be collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| We want to be involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| We want to be involved in rulemaking, et cetera, to make sure that merit principles in the city of Knoxville will remain strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| Again, I appreciate you allowing me to speak and I will be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| Should counsel have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Thank you, Miss Ballenger. Next person signed up to speak is Mike Winchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| Mr. Winchester, you have if you could start by stating your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2878)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you, Eric, can you hear me? Yes, we can. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you very much. Mike Winchester. My law office is 800 South Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| Sweet one thousand Knoxville, Tennessee. First of all, let me thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| And thank the vice mayor and all the council for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| I'm not here to give legal advice or to criticize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| I'm here to try to point out some of the issues that we have with this proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| I've been the civil I've been the civil service merit boards attorney since March of 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| And this is probably, in my view, the most significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| And quite frankly, overall change and not just function, but in how things work at the civil service level and the city personnel or HR department, as you as you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2931)|
| 0:49:07| I want to make sure one thing is very clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| It's not the civil service position that all we do is monitor what the city does or what the HR department will do, as noted in several of the sections of this proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2951)|
| 0:49:29| Establishing an HR department does not require that changing the classification and compensation duties or rulemaking duties from civil service to a new HR director is necessary to have an HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2969)|
| 0:49:47| I know you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| One of the things that I do want to point out, section 231 of the of the charter that's mentioned in the preamble of this ordinance says that the city of Knoxville has the power to create abolish departments and to confer authority for carrying out the powers and to promulgate rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=2990)|
| 0:50:12| There's no doubt that you have the authority to establish an HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| That's not that's not an issue with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| But the second part of that particular chart provision says that when any power is vested by this charter in any specific officer, board, commission or other agency, the same shall be deemed to have exclusive jurisdiction within that particular field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3019)|
| 0:50:39| That having been said, our concerns, my concerns from a legal standpoint, which I have voiced to the law department and met with both Charles Swanson and George Schultz from time to time, and we've worked through some of these issues and the ordinance has been modified to some extent to address some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3039)|
| 0:50:56| So we've made some progress, but the issue becomes, are there powers and duties of the civil service merit board that will be impacted by or infringed upon or encroached upon or that may not be allowed by ordinance to go to a different department since those powers have been granted to civil service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3056)|
| 0:51:20| Those are the those are the main concerns I have with my duties to the civil service board merit board to make sure we protect our duties under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3080)|
| 0:51:32| Neither we cannot waive those duties and there's no ordinance that can be passed that can change those duties or modify them if they're if they are provided by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3092)|
| 0:51:45| Those duties are set forth in charter provision one thousand three F for the civil service merit board and are called powers and duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3105)|
| 0:51:54| And the first three of those powers and duties are to represent the public interest with regard to merit system principles in the management and administration of the personnel system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3114)|
| 0:52:06| We are also supposed to protect employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| One minute, one minute left, Mr. Winchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Right. And to do things that that allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| We have a problem with the reclassification section for 13, even though it was modified to take out the lack of an ability to appeal by a employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3140)|
| 0:52:34| It still would allow a director to agree with an employee to a reclassification of a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| We think that violates the charter. Only the only the civil service can agree to that and allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| We also think that taking the civil service totally out of the classification system involves impacts our right to our exclusive right to prepare examinations and certifications based on classification and specifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3170)|
| 0:53:09| because we need those and need to have impact on those to prepare our exams and to certify employees as eligible for positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3189)|
| 0:53:18| Mr. Winchester, that that is a full five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Thank you, Mayor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| Let's see, there's another person speaking who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| Steve King, are you on the call, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Yes, I am, Mayor. OK, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| Yes, thank you, Mayor. My name is Steve King. I live at 6016 Apache Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3225)|
| 0:53:56| Mayor and Council, I represent the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| I was recently elected president. I also appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| Miss Ballinger and Mr. Winchester speaking tonight to provide some clarity, I think from hearing both of them, you can see why our association has expressed that continues to express some concerns with the HR proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3247)|
| 0:54:27| When we hear the attorney that's represented the Civil Service Merit Board for several decades express concerns, it it brings some level of concern among employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3267)|
| 0:54:46| Like in my email that I sent counsel, there are several things that that we can agree with, but there's several things that we think that this ordinance should be postponed and conversations and work continue with, particularly the merit board and its attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3286)|
| 0:55:08| I shared with the merit board last week my concern about strengthening Civil Service Merit Board rules to prevent things that happened like happened to me in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3308)|
| 0:55:26| As many of you know, my position was eliminated. And I had to hire an attorney, file a grievance to fight for my civil service rights. So I would like to see to see things improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3326)|
| 0:55:46| And I hope that counsel will continue to allow employees groups and civil service merit board and staff to continue to work toward things that we can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3346)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Law, could you clarify for members of these issues that were brought up? Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3366)|
| 0:56:30| We can't hear you. I can't hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| I have to unmute myself for you to hear me. Okay. All right. We're ready. We can hear you all to learn how these machines work, but I'm starting to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3393)|
| 0:56:46| And I just wanted to address a couple of the legal issues that have been raised with regard to this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3406)|
| 0:56:55| I would like to say that I have great respect for Mike Winchester for Mike Winchester's legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| He's been around a long time as attorney for civil service merit board. And I like him a lot as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| But as often as the case, reasonable minds differ with regard to some legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| And clearly, this is a mind upon which this is this is an issue upon which reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| I would like to point out that the core functions with regard to civil service are to have merit based hiring, merit based promotions, merit based employee discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3440)|
| 0:57:34| All of those things are the real core functions of what a civil service department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Now, if you adopt this ordinance tonight, that's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| That's still going to be the core function of the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| Nobody is going to be hired in a classified position for the city of city of Knoxville unless they have passed a validated test and been registered by the civil service merit board as one of the top five to get passed on to the directors to be hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3469)|
| 0:58:10| That's not going to happen on the back end. That's going to happen on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| That's what happens now. That's what's going to happen after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| With regard to promotions, that will not be different. That will be handled through the same sort of process that is handled right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| And it will be merit based and it will be come through the civil service merit board and the civil service merit board will again provide directors with a group of individuals who have qualified for promotions on a merit based basis before any promotion can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3506)|
| 0:58:47| So that's going to be on the front end. It's not going to be on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| And the same thing with regard to employee discipline. When something happens where an employee and an action occurs that negatively impacts an employee, if the employee thinks that action was not merit based, then that employee is going to have the same right after this ordinance is passed that that employee has right now to go to the civil service merit board, file a grievance, file an appeal of that employee action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3532)|
| 0:59:19| and to have that heard by an independent officer who is appointed by the civil service merit board, have a full hearing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| And then if they're not satisfied after that, they can always take the matter to court after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| All of that's going to happen after this ordinance passes just the same way as it happens right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| So, you know, there's not going to be any impairment of the merit based employee system with regard to classified employees in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3579)|
| 0:59:51| So if that is your concern, it's not a real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| So I think that addresses the legal issues with regard to whether or not this ordinance impairs the merit based hiring promotions and adverse employee actions with regard to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3596)|
| 1:00:11| And if there are any other legal questions, George Shields has been working on this and is very up to date on all of the technical issues related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3611)|
| 1:00:22| Any of the council members have any questions regarding the legal issues associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| We would be glad to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| So we've heard from the merit board's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| We've heard from the city attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| I reached out to Mr. Frost and asked him, would he be prepared to give us his opinion as our attorney, as city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3645)|
| 1:00:56| Does he see legal problems with the ordinance as it's written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| You have to unmute yourself, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| My computer is having issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| I just got on my phone and caught part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Briefly, I reviewed the ordinance line by line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| I had the charter and the current code of ordinance beside me, and I went through it and spent a few hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| Personally, and I don't mean to disagree with Mr. Winchester, I guess I'm a mere babe of only my 25th year of practice in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3696)|
| 1:01:46| But I didn't see anything in the proposed ordinance that caused me heartburn from a legal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3706)|
| 1:01:55| In many circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3715)|
| 1:02:03| that is for years and some circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| In many circumstances, the big difference is in the proposed ordinance, the proposed new department rather than civil service will be tasked with the duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3729)|
| 1:02:22| I've heard the discussions that there may be issues with the proposed ordinance and the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| I personally did not see those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| And if they did exist unequivocally, what the charter says overrules what's in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3752)|
| 1:02:42| Actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| We're losing you a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| Proposed under the ordinance have been previously over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| For example, if you go to page 33 of the agenda and look at section two, there's a there's some changes to ordinance to dash one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3777)|
| 1:03:12| To dash one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| Losing you. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| Take the video video off. We can't hear you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Maybe just have your voice only and maybe that'll help with your connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| Look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Sound better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| So, do you look on page 33 of the agenda and you go to the proposed changes for ordinance to dash one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3822)|
| 1:03:55| That one has been amended six times since 2004 and most recently as 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3835)|
| 1:04:05| My point is that ordinances change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Some of the ordinances being proposed tonight for change have actually been amended over the years with the support of civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3848)|
| 1:04:20| The issue tonight is really a reorganization of the executive branch proposed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3860)|
| 1:04:28| Mayoral reorganization often occurs when a new mayor comes in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| For example, I served the last two years of Mayor ashes 16 years in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| Mayor Ash had organized things one way. And then when Mayor has them came in office, he wanted to change a few things himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3882)|
| 1:04:51| And he caused a reorganization back then when Mayor has made his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| Some people did not like it. And that's fine. Ultimately, it did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| I see this as a similar situation where, as Mr. Swanson said earlier, good and reasonable people can disagree about Mayor can canons proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3903)|
| 1:05:13| I just don't see this proposal having legal issues, but it's really a policy decision where the council needs to decide whether or not it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3913)|
| 1:05:25| If it ultimately goes to court, that's fine. You know, that's what the law department is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| And I just think it's it's a policy that council needs to decide whether or not it deserves your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3931)|
| 1:05:39| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Frost. Miss, do you get any any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| Yes. So I'm not certain what items it's only the one item that attorney Frost just just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3947)|
| 1:05:55| But are there additional items that attorney Winchester is referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| And were those items were all of those items discussed? It sounds like you guys may have had a workshop and there were some changes made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3961)|
| 1:06:09| Were the additional items that Mr. Winchester is referencing, whatever they may be, were those discussed as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| Mr. Swanson. Yes, they were discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| We had Mr. Mr. Winchester on two separate occasions for a total of six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| George Shields and I met with Mr. Winchester for six hours. We went through every provision of the ordinance together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3987)|
| 1:06:35| I can't say full agreement with regard to those provisions, but we did go through them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=3995)|
| 1:06:44| We understood what he was saying. We did, in fact, make some revisions to the ordinance to provide assurances that we were not in any way intending to impair the protections afforded to employees under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4004)|
| 1:06:57| We very specifically said that we've said that throughout the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| We changed the ordinance a couple of times to to address the issues that he raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| And I think it's fair to say that we have not cured all the concerns that Mr. Winchester has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| But we do believe that we are offering to you an ordinance that does not in any way impair the protections afforded to employees under the civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4035)|
| 1:07:28| Thank you, Mr. Swanson. Vice Mayor McKenzie, did you have any further questions at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| I mean, does anyone know how many specific items there were that no consensus or agreement could be made on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4053)|
| 1:07:45| I do not know how many were enumerated at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| Mr. Swanson or Mr. Shields, did you have any? Was it more general than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| Rather than specifically enumerated things as we went through our six hours of discussions that tended to be a moving target and it changed from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4076)|
| 1:08:09| I think one of the real things that we were unable to reach a genuine consensus agreement about had to do with the reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4089)|
| 1:08:18| I think you need to understand that a classification is nothing more than a job description and the job description is now being moved to the executive branch service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4098)|
| 1:08:33| But there's still going to have to be a valid test. It's going to have to be a job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| And then civil service is going to take that job description. They're going to turn that job description around and make a test that has to be a validated test or person to operate in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4118)|
| 1:08:53| And when that validated test is rendered to employees, then the civil service merit board will decide who is on a merit-based basis, who is qualified to take that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4133)|
| 1:09:06| And then they will send the top five scoring candidates to the administration to choose who to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4146)|
| 1:09:15| And that's not going to change at all. So I don't think there is a problem with the reclassification that has been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4155)|
| 1:09:24| And we have talked about that. We've tried to resolve our issues on that. We've been unsuccessful, I guess, in reaching a full agreement. But we try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4164)|
| 1:09:34| Mayor, if I may, I'd like to ask Mr. Winchester, is that his understanding as well of the outcome of the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4174)|
| 1:09:44| Mr. Winchester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Could you address the vice mayor's question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Yes, I'll try to. Thanks again for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Thanks. I'd like to thank the law director and George Shields. They did meet with me virtually for many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| We did work through several things that did result in changes to the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| And I believe with further discussion, some more things can change. But let me address the specific issue raised by Vice Mayor McKenzie and your law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| The reclassification provision that we had the most trouble with is under Ordinance Section 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4217)|
| 1:10:27| And what it would do would allow the employee to request classification adjustment, which is another way of saying reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4227)|
| 1:10:40| It involves Code Section 2452. When you read it, it's the one that I believe, respectfully, that the City Council had a lot of trouble with in the very first time you considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4240)|
| 1:10:53| It was the one that denied the employee a right to appeal and also had provisions in it that I believe were of some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4253)|
| 1:11:05| It was changed to some extent. But what it does is this. It allows the city director to agree with an employee who wants a classification adjustment to that adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4265)|
| 1:11:26| I'm just reading from the proposed ordinance. If the director agrees with the employee, the director shall recommend the change to the Department of Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4286)|
| 1:11:36| After reviewing the recommendation, the Department of Human Resources may approve or deny the recommendation upon its merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4296)|
| 1:11:45| It goes on and says if the director does not agree, the request shall be referred to the Department of Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| In either case, the Department of Human Resources decision will be final. If the request is denied and the employee believes the denial was made on other than basis of merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4313)|
| 1:12:06| the employee may seek a review of the denial with civil service in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| The problem with that ordinance is this. First of all, if the employee and the director agree, then the change is made and civil service is not even notified of the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4334)|
| 1:12:29| In other words, there is a reclassification and a repositioning of that employee without civil service receiving notice of it, certifying it, putting it up for promotional list or for comment, which is what the current rules allow us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4349)|
| 1:12:51| We believe that is a direct violation of the merit system principles and it goes around civil service. It prevents us from being able to whether you want to call it a promotion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4371)|
| 1:13:04| It's directly contrary to Section 1005 of the Charter. It also violates 1004 of the Charter and Section 1003F2, which allows the board to be responsible for certifying, that is saying and confirming to the city that a particular employee has the requisite skills and abilities to perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4384)|
| 1:13:33| under that classification. It carves this out totally. So and it also limits the employee's right to appeal only if it's based on something other than merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4413)|
| 1:13:45| So the Charter specifically allows an employee to ask for and to have a hearing examiner hear an appeal. And I'm just reading from Section 1003F6 of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4425)|
| 1:13:59| It says that to hear or designate a hearing examiner to hear appeal submitted by an employee in a classified position relevant to any personnel action adverse to that employee, whether it's a discharge or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4439)|
| 1:14:16| So what that specific section would do, it would keep civil service from being involved in the reclassification of a position. And it would also potentially limit an employee's ability to appeal. That's what the ordinance as drafted says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4456)|
| 1:14:35| So, yes, we have a problem with that. And what's a particular concern to me is that the city law director, by opinion of a prior city law director back in 1982, John Roach wrote an opinion number 823 that basically addressed reclassification of employees and said that under the law and under the Charter provisions as he read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4475)|
| 1:15:03| And I'm just reading from his opinion. It says that the civil service office is to be notified of any intent to reclassify positions. This ordinance section is totally adverse to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4503)|
| 1:15:18| It goes on and says that pursuant to the memorandum of understanding that the civil service had with the city from 1982 forward after the Charter was amended, it says that that while the board doesn't initiate reclassification, it does have the role of monitoring the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4518)|
| 1:15:40| Section 1003 F10 gives the board the necessary authority to veto any proposed reclassification, which it determines to violate merit system principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4540)|
| 1:15:52| So what amazes me, and again, I have all the respect in the world for the law director, for George Shields, Rob Frost and their opinions, but on that particular section, which is just one of our concerns, we have a direct opinion from a prior law director saying that that reclassification should at least notify us and give us the right to veto that on merit system principles or look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4552)|
| 1:16:22| and decide whether it should go forward. So that's my response. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| Thank you, Mr. Winchester. Vice Mayor McKenzie, I'd like to ask our George Shields to respond to that because I think there's a little misunderstanding of the context. So, Mr. Shields, could you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4587)|
| 1:16:42| Yes, Mayor. Thank you very much. George Shields, City Law Department. I want to begin with the idea that we're violating the Charter with this. Let me start at a high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4602)|
| 1:16:56| The Charter doesn't refer to the Civil Service Merit Board having a role in classification. It says the City of Knoxville performs the classification function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4616)|
| 1:17:05| When that section of the Charter was written, we had a personnel department that was in fact performing the classification function. Mr. Winchester agreed that that was true at last week's Merit Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4625)|
| 1:17:16| So when the Charter was written as it exists today, the drafters of it had a personnel department in mind because it existed. And the function that it was performing in the classification space is exactly what this ordinance proposes to restore to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4636)|
| 1:17:31| Approved that ordinance, sent it to the voters to make it an amendment to the Charter. When the voters approved that amendment to the Charter, everyone did it knowing that the personnel department performed the classification function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4651)|
| 1:17:44| And then less than three months after the voters approved the current Charter, the City Council made some adjustments to the Code in order to conform the Code to those new Charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4664)|
| 1:17:55| And what that change said reconfirmed exactly that the personnel department continued to perform the classification function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| What the Code added, what the Council added was that the Merit Board could monitor their classification function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| The Code did not say anything about notifications. It did not say anything about advanced notice or involvement of civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4690)|
| 1:18:18| Those procedures were worked out through an MOU. Those were not necessary to be put in the Code. No one at the time thought that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| And so to the extent that civil service and there's a need to provide that notification, we can provide that through rules, through MOUs and through secondary and tertiary rulemaking, not through this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4705)|
| 1:18:41| I want to mention as well that Mr. Winchester acknowledged that that opinion from the law director in the 80s acknowledged that the Board does not initiate reclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4721)|
| 1:18:51| And that's what this ordinance also confirms. The Board is not initiating. That was a role that the personnel department performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| And this ordinance restores the initiation to what we will call the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| I think that responds to the bulk of it. Oh, I think he noted something too about this impinging on promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4744)|
| 1:19:14| But the Merit Board's own rules acknowledge that a reclassification can go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| And we've yet to find a system that includes any other employer that has a civil service system that defines promotions and reclassifications as synonyms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4759)|
| 1:19:30| They are separate functions, and I think that's proven by the Board's own rules. So reclassification does not impinge on promotion. They're just two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| And again, for the entire lifetime that the City had both a Merit Board and a personnel department existing under our current charter, the same as it is today, reclassification and classification generally was handled by the personnel department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4777)|
| 1:19:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Mr. Shields, could I just ask a clarifying question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Is it true that right now classification things don't actually go to the Civil Service Merit Board, they just go to Ms. Hatfield and her team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4796)|
| 1:20:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| The Board, through its rules, has basically delegated virtually all of its authority over classification and reclassification matters to the Executive Secretary rather than for the Board as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4815)|
| 1:20:28| Okay. Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| I just want to say thank you for clarifying that, because when we first discussed this prior to it going to workshops with the different employee groups, I asked a series of questions of Ms. Hatfield and got that exact answer that Mr. Shields just clarified for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4831)|
| 1:20:47| That it wasn't the Civil Service Merit Board, that it was Ms. Hatfield solely that handled that from top to middle to bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4847)|
| 1:20:56| Judge, jury, determiner, which is why I said in the last meeting when we passed this on first reading that I was supporting this, I don't feel there's a system of checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4856)|
| 1:21:08| Thank you, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Just to reiterate, Ms. Singh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| There's some points that we're real stuck on, and I've gotten a lot of emails from employees asking for more time, but I'm wondering if more time would be helpful or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4878)|
| 1:21:31| Can we discuss this, I guess, with Mr. King and the attorneys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| Well, Council Member, well, you didn't, I'll let you, you asked the attorneys, so we can let the attorneys speak more. I'd be happy to address that question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4899)|
| 1:21:50| Okay. Would two weeks give, change anything? Would that give time for any sort of resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| I would just like to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| We have had three workshops with the Civil Service Mayor Board so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| In addition to those six hours of sessions we've had with the Civil Service Mayor Board's attorney, we've had three workshops with each of the various employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4929)|
| 1:22:20| We've had two working group meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| We have had lots of hours, lots and lots and lots of hours devoted to this whole subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| And really the issues have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| Everybody is saying the same thing they were saying when this whole process started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| So it doesn't feel to me that devoting more time to this subject is going to make a significant difference in the decision that you're going to have to make here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4958)|
| 1:22:47| I think you're just going to have to decide whether this is an appropriate measure for the Chief Executive of the City to make in terms of organizing her administration or whether it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4967)|
| 1:23:00| And then we'll just have to go forward from there because I don't see us making any progress by spending more and more time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| Ms. Singh, I would just like to add that we do have a transition team ready to work on this starting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4987)|
| 1:23:17| This is approved tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| And Christine Fitzgerald would be the acting HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| And we have members of the committee ready to start tomorrow from police, fire, general government, law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5005)|
| 1:23:32| I invited Jamie Ballinger, the chair of the Civil Service Mayor Board, to serve on this transition committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| There are going to be a transition time where we work on how all these details will be ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| We don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| The best way to move forward is to vote to support it and then we'll work out the implementation details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| I don't think delaying is going to move the ball forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| It'll just delay things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| And I would ask for your support in part because this HR department is going to allow us to help our employees and support better recruitment, more diverse police and firefighters and other members of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5044)|
| 1:24:20| We have so many challenges facing our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| And the more we can support our employees, the better they can serve our residents and the better that we can adjust to these challenges facing our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5063)|
| 1:24:34| As far as racial bias and training on that and giving people pathways to move forward and all of the protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5074)|
| 1:24:44| I, as mayor, would never condone discrimination or nepotism or patronage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| But if any employee ever feels like there's those issues, all the protections remain in place and they can appeal to the Civil Service Mayor Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| And Ms. Ballinger, you can speak to this, but in our phone conversation, she said she'd be happy to serve on the transition committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| And she would welcome the opportunity to represent as chair of the Civil Service Mayor Board, be a voice to make sure we're implementing in a way that is consistent with the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5104)|
| 1:25:15| And I trust that she would do a good job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| So there's a lot of willing and able people ready to move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| And I appreciate the questions and hope you'll vote to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| Mayor, if you will, and I want to go back to Councilwoman Ryder's remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5129)|
| 1:25:37| And I think that at a minimum, if we could get an assurance that there would be at least some type of MOU as relates to this one specific item that that's been discussed here today about notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5137)|
| 1:25:48| I think that may give a better sense of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| And I know we've got a great transition team that's going to be in place, but I think just an assurance that they're going to work in tandem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| And if there's MOUs that are needed, and specifically, it sounds like particularly on this particular issue, there is a need for one for checks and balances purposes, if nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5160)|
| 1:26:10| I think that that would give me a greater sense of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| Well, I certainly commit to working on this and addressing issues as they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| And if they need to be addressed in formal ways, happy to do that, working with the law department and the transition team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5181)|
| 1:26:30| If they need to be addressed in more administrative ways, that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| I saw Mr. Roberto, did you have your hand raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| I just wanted to address, I think, the conversation that Council Member Singh wanted to have about, you know, if there would be some amount of delay, maybe two weeks or so that would maybe change some minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5200)|
| 1:26:58| You know, I think we had a very robust City Council workshop where a lot of these provisions were discussed and, you know, changes were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5218)|
| 1:27:07| You know, I don't, I haven't seen that there's been, you know, I think what you've heard from several of the attorneys is, you know, you are now presented with, you know, an ordinance, a document that you either are comfortable with moving forward with or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5227)|
| 1:27:24| Now, that being said, you know, I think there's not really any benefit to delay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| There is merit to the idea of an HR department and good parts and I believe good intentions behind the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| For me, though, I'm concerned with the expansion of executive authority and some specific provisions contained in the ordinance that just prevent me from being able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5259)|
| 1:27:50| So, I don't think we should delay, but I also can't support the ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| Thank you, Mr. Roberto. Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| There are several issues that still have not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| From my point of view, even particularly the issue with some of the transparency that would be removed during the reclassification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5286)|
| 1:28:24| And the fact that, you know, I think what Vice Mayor McKenzie might have been referring to with notice, Civil Service Merit Board is not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5304)|
| 1:28:36| And that brings these disputes to a court of law when they could have been resolved previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5316)|
| 1:28:44| And it just does not seem like a good idea for us to commit to an ordinance that essentially puts our Civil Service Merit Board in a position of having to seek that resolution in a court of law when we could resolve it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5324)|
| 1:29:04| I think that's one reason to delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| You know, one discussion that took place during the last Civil Service Merit Board meeting was that there's an implementation plan in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5348)|
| 1:29:18| And if the Civil Service Merit Board could have a sense of what that plan is on the front end, they would have a sense of how some of the rules would be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5358)|
| 1:29:29| And would have a better understanding of whether it would, you know, remove any of their authority under those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5369)|
| 1:29:39| You know, other issues are, I just, I really think that it's, even though there have been a lot of conversations, I do not think there has been thorough conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5379)|
| 1:29:55| It takes time to fully understand everything that's in these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5395)|
| 1:30:06| And then once changes are made, those need to be reviewed and discussed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| It does seem like this was the only opportunity for any sort of changes to be made, any sort of compromise to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5412)|
| 1:30:22| It doesn't send the message that there's any willingness to work together moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5422)|
| 1:30:31| It is, you know, what has been presented, either you accept it or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| And I don't think that sends the message to employees that they will be listened to, you know, moving forward as things would be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5439)|
| 1:30:48| I also, I do not, I have not been able to, you know, become an expert on this issue as I would like to have, because there are so many issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5448)|
| 1:31:02| But time after time, when looking at the executive secretary's role, either when it comes to administrative rules, those have to be signed off by the mayor anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5462)|
| 1:31:15| And so we're removing that position, which is our EO officer, essentially, and putting all the power in the hands of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5475)|
| 1:31:26| And so I feel like we have checks and balances in place that we are now removing, because that position would no longer be in the mix, and it would just go to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5486)|
| 1:31:38| So there are a lot of things that are being discussed that I think with further discussion could be fleshed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5498)|
| 1:31:46| Ultimately, though, I will have to say that my opinion is that during a pandemic, this is not the time to create this new department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5506)|
| 1:31:58| There are much more urgent needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| I thought that there was a good report from the Civil Service Mayor Board on progress that has been made in the city around recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5521)|
| 1:32:13| And I think that that department could use a bit of more support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| But the idea of an entire new department that does put more power in the hands of the mayor, I worry that this will only break down trust, break down transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5540)|
| 1:32:34| And I worry about how conversations around this will move forward if passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Just a couple points of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| First, our Equal Employment Opportunity Officer is Charles Lomax, who's also the Director of Community Empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| Also, I think we have over the, you know, during Mayor Rojero's administration and just in the six months where I've been mayor, we've had many meetings with employees and their employee reps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5573)|
| 1:33:05| And just since your April council meeting, when we first had this on, we've had 13 changes to reflect employee concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5585)|
| 1:33:15| Those were just sections 6, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, and 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5595)|
| 1:33:22| So I submit to you that we have been very responsive to employee concerns and we will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| And we have a great transition team in place that includes the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| And I believe that this will be, continue to be a transparent process that makes our employees better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| Well, let me correct myself because maybe the title is not EEO Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| But it's a position that is established by our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| And it's a staff member appointed to the Civil Service Merit Board, which hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| The Secretary is the only one who is appointed to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| So we may call another position or give those responsibilities to another position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| But I believe by charter that those responsibilities are supposed to be held by the position appointed to the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5657)|
| 1:34:25| And you all can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| We're not changing the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| And the charter is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| The protections and duties listed in the charter are also not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| You know, I don't know how many times we can say that, but it's still true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| And, you know, Ms. Hatfield and whoever in the future may serve in that role would still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| their primary role would be to help address employee concerns and grievances who feel they've been discriminated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5689)|
| 1:35:01| And so, you know, that stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| And they would, you know, those separation of powers would be more distinct than it has been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| So charter doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Civil Service Merit protections don't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| We will gain an HR department like every other large organization and peer city in the state of Tennessee and across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5714)|
| 1:35:23| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| I have one follow-up for Mr. Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| I think there's general consensus, as I mentioned in the first reading, there's general consensus to the benefits of an HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| There are peer cities that have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| The important part, I think the crux of the matter for most of us, if I've listened well, is a check and balance and protections for employees, particularly as it relates to classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5738)|
| 1:35:50| And while I don't think that there's a required notification from HR department or a director to the Civil Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| I do believe, Mr. Shields, you said the Civil Service retains its monitoring authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| Can you unpack that word a little bit more from the city's perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| Sure, Councilman Smith. Thanks very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| You're right. Part of what we've done with this ordinance is put back in the code the same monitoring language that was used in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5771)|
| 1:36:19| And so what that could look like in practice is something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| Board has under the charter several different powers that can be relevant to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| One is maybe the most obvious, which is the power to hear complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| You know, if an employee brings a complaint of an action that's contrary to merit principles, the board can hear that complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| If it investigates it or if it decides to investigate an issue on its own, either way, it can call witnesses and compel testimony through subpoena and also documents, if necessary, as part of that investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5800)|
| 1:36:54| If the board concludes at the end of an investigation like that, that there has been some violation of merit system principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5814)|
| 1:37:02| the board can order that whatever that practice was stop and order that whatever violation occurred be remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| And if for some reason it was necessary for the board to go to court to have a court order to enforce that decision, it has that power as well under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5829)|
| 1:37:19| So it doesn't have to come from an employee's complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| They can take it up on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| But however it comes to them, I think they have robust powers to look into something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| Robust monitoring power applies both to classifications and promotions based on the distinction between those two things that you made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5850)|
| 1:37:38| That's right. Promotions stay with civil service under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| So HR won't be involving itself in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| But if there's a classification issue and that issue implicates merit principles, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| Those powers are there for the board if they choose to exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| To be clear, if an employee thinks another employee is receiving unfair treatment as it relates to reclassification changes, they can raise that complaint with the civil service board and that board would hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5874)|
| 1:38:06| That's right. The board can hear complaints about adverse employment actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| And so if someone's being mistreated in a classification matter, that would be within that scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| Okay. Thank you. That was my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Thank you, Mr. Smith. Any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Mr. Shields, one of the comments that was made previously was something about transparency of classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5905)|
| 1:38:33| And I feel like we touched on this a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| I believe when I asked Ms. Hatfield about it, there is no publication or public notice of classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5915)|
| 1:38:47| There is no removal. Can you speak to that, Mr. Shields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| Sure. In classification generally, the classification plan comes to council ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5933)|
| 1:39:00| And so that's the public input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| Which we voted on some at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| That's right. That's right. You sometimes see, you know, sort of small changes to it over the course of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| I think probably what you were referring to has to do with reclassification specifically, where there's an individual employee who is requesting to move, you know, from their existing classification to a different classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5951)|
| 1:39:24| And the transparency that exists in that process has never been set out in the charter or in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| It's all done through the next level down, if you will, which currently is the Civil Service Merit Board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| And those rules say that a proposed reclassification, you know, that there will be an announcement made that there's a reclassification being considered in case anyone wants to provide comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5977)|
| 1:39:49| So the absence of that from the ordinance does not necessarily indicate an absence of that procedure because it's not in the code right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| And yet that is the procedure. And I don't have any reason to think that that would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| I think reclassifications would still be, you know, made as an announcement so that anybody who wants to comment on it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| Okay. So the idea that we're removing it from the code is a fallacy because it's not in the code right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6008)|
| 1:40:15| That's exactly right. There's no notification or announcement or any of those requirements set forth in the code right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| Okay. And then another question that may be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| On the comments that this moving power from one entity to another, being the mayor's office or the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6027)|
| 1:40:38| Currently, the executive secretary answers to the Civil Service Merit Board on Civil Service Merit Board and classification matters. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6038)|
| 1:40:50| That's the oversight for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| Yes, I think that's theoretically correct. But in practice, the board has delegated much of its role just directly to the executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6054)|
| 1:41:02| And they serve advisory to the executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| It's hard for me to characterize that because I'm not sure that the board involves itself, frankly, in classification matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6067)|
| 1:41:15| I think it's just been treated as two separate lanes. One is exclusively the executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| So in terms of the ordinances that we have currently adopted now and the charter as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6082)|
| 1:41:31| whom does the executive secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board answer to in terms of personnel and HR decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6091)|
| 1:41:40| I think part of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| There's nothing? Is there anything in the code that specifies that hierarchy or structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| Not clearly, no. I was going to say if I had to apply a word to describe it, it's very murky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| Ultimately, the executive secretary should answer to the board, but there are several roles that the executive secretary plays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| Some of those roles were transferred to that position because the personnel department went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| They were never really the board's powers. They were the personnel department's powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| But they have landed essentially on one person for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| And so when the executive secretary is performing those old personnel functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| the code doesn't really give us a lot of guidance there as far as to whom she is supposed to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| That's part, I think, of the reason why this ordinance arose was to straighten out those structural problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6147)|
| 1:42:34| So I asked this question in response to comments that I have gotten from employees and past issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6154)|
| 1:42:43| some employees who've been with the city for quite a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| is that you have one person who doesn't answer to the administration who gets to make the personnel decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6166)|
| 1:42:54| And then if you don't agree with the personnel decisions, you file your complaint with that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| And the Civil Service Merit Board, or actually it doesn't even go to the Civil Service Merit Board from the discussions that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| And that person gets to decide whether they did a good job and they agree with the decision that they made as the personnel director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| And based on that, that is compacting all the powers of personnel and fairness and equity into one individual that can consult with the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6193)|
| 1:43:28| Uncoupling these things puts personnel decisions with another entity and gives you a fair complaint process for disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6208)|
| 1:43:40| And that is what I've been given feedback on from employees who have not had that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| So that is why I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| I have a question for Mike Winchester, if he's still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| Mr. Winchester, he's still there. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| Mr. Winchester, did you hear what was just outlined by Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6252)|
| 1:44:19| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Is that a good description of the process in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| Could you clarify for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| Let me tell you why. First of all, the current code does have, and I respectfully disagree with Mr. Shields on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| I'm not saying that Council Member Ryder doesn't understand it that way, or maybe she's heard it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| But right now, current code section 2-447 on the maintenance of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6287)|
| 1:44:54| That's one of the code sections that will be modified by this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| It involves 2-447, Sub-A deals with classification of classification plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6299)|
| 1:45:09| The first sentence says, the Civil Service Merit Board through its Executive Secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6309)|
| 1:45:17| is responsible for the proper and continuous maintenance of the classification plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| so that it will reflect on a current basis the duties being performed by each employee in the City Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| and the class to which each position is allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| The next sentence is very important in response to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| The Executive Secretary shall periodically review the classification of positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| and upon the basis of his investigation, shall recommend to the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| or submission to Council necessary amendments to the classification plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| in the form of new classes, revisions of existing classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| and the abolishment of classes no longer required in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| Let me stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| So right now, in response to the statement that somehow the Executive Secretary doesn't answer to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| on classification issues, it's totally opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| The Executive Secretary can only act under rules and regulations permitted by the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6377)|
| 1:46:24| but when she does make recommendations, they go to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| The Mayor can submit them or not to the Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| and the Council has to approve those amendments to the classification plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| It's not done automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| It's certainly not done solely by the Executive Secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| and if that was someone's understanding of the current law, it was totally incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I would just, if I could say that one of the challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| one of the reasons police and firefighters are supporting the HR Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| is that when they have tried to, you know, have some help and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| through the current structure of civil service doing HR, it hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| And I don't, I as Mayor and Mayor Rojero and Mayor Haslam before her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| don't have an HR team to say we want to try this strategy for recruiting more diverse police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| We want to try this strategy for being more competitive on our retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| We don't want to spend thousands of dollars training our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| just to have them leave to another city after we invest all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| So this is part of the reason we think it's a good idea to have an HR Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| Mr. Shields, did you have something that you wanted to clarify in response to these comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| Thank you, Mayor. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| What I wanted to do was return to that text because I think it's instructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| The text that Mr. Winchester quoted from said the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| through its Executive Secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| And what past board members have informed us is that that language has been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| to suggest to the board that when it comes to classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| the duty rests with the Executive Secretary because it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| because that office is specifically named, that it's the board not acting as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| but the board acting through its Executive Secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| And the Merit Board's own rules confirm that, you know, Mr. Winchester is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| The board could write rules that would say otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| but they haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Their rules say that when a reclassification is requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| if the changes are approved by the Executive Secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| a pay increase may be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| There's no reference to the board approving anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| The Executive Secretary does the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| The Executive Secretary does the approving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| and the board isn't part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| And I just wanted to make sure that that was clear for members of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Thank you, Mr. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Just my apologies if there was any misunderstanding of what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| I heard what Mr. Winchester just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| and everything he specifically read to us was specific to classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| And I was speaking about personnel decisions not specific to classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| So just to clarify my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| I think we're ready to call for the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| Seeing no further comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| do we have to vote on calling for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| There's no comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| No comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| Then, Mr. Johnson, would you please conduct a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6573)|

| 1:50:26| and reconvene at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=6626)|

| 2:10:40| I asked because the resolution says it's for routine replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=7840)|

| 2:17:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Ryder. So, I believe that Mr. Johnson has sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| out some dates, and we're just trying to get a date confirmed on the calendar for that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8274)|
| 2:18:03| It needs to happen in July if it's going to happen prior to the next vote on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8283)|
| 2:18:10| development transition rule. And this would be part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| Okay, to talk about plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| The plan development rule, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| That doesn't impact this particular...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| No, not at all. It's just in reviewing this agenda item and watching the NPC footage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| this and the next agenda item, just a lot of questions come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| And I don't know, I have reservations about plan development and when and how we're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8318)|
| 2:18:47| it in the future. Mr. Green, could you clarify, so this particular agenda item and the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8327)|
| 2:18:55| they have gone for this preliminary review to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| and then they'll come back with more detailed plans to the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| and the Building Department, and they don't come back to Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| And they're not publicly vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| They're not publicly vetted. It's a staff review for the detailed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| No, they come to the Planning Commission. Those meetings are noticed publicly through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| posting of property agenda on the Planning Commission agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| and postcards to the surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| Okay. So there is public notification process input for that final plan. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| Okay. And then just, this is more of a housekeeping thing for plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| not to this agenda item. I'm so sorry, Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| The other thing is when you read the AIS and the agenda packet for these, they both say they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| to be heard twice at Council, but they're on our agenda as resolutions, not as ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| So that means we'll only be hearing them one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| They were advertised twice, if you look at the packet, to be heard twice at Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8407)|
| 2:20:14| So I think that's just something that needs to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| I did not write the AIS and the intention to have it as a resolution came from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| City Law Department. As it is not an ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| the resolution seemed the appropriate way for Council to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| Okay. All right. I'll... Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| I'll ask the Law Department to address... Do you want to speak to that now, Mr. Swanson, or is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8436)|
| 2:20:45| I think Mr. Green gave the correct answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Originally, it came as... This is a brand new process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| and originally it came in the form of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| Upon further review and looking at what we were really doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| changing another one anyway. And so it seemed more appropriate to do this by resolution than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| by ordinance. And so the original ordinance was changed to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| It came to you initially as a resolution. That's why that was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| The AIS statement was listed in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| Thank you. Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| Yes. I've got some late communication from some of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8479)|
| 2:21:26| on the specific project there with the VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| And they're not necessarily opposing the project at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| but the concern was that they would like to have some more input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8494)|
| 2:21:40| into some of the periphery matters. They're subject to trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| possibly impermeable surfaces, or surfaces rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| Director Green, is there going to be an opportunity for these neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8509)|
| 2:21:54| to have some input as this project is implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| To be quite honest, Council Member Thomas, I think it's a bit disingenuous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| for them to provide their comments at this late hour on the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| There was a public hearing before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| Not one member of the neighborhood spoke at that public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| That would... Of course, at this time, the council can still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| One of the reasons... Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| One of the reasons for this hearing before the City Council on the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| is to make recommendations for changes. So this is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| But again, I think it's a bit disingenuous for the neighborhood who knew the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| to wait until this late hour to make those comments known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| If they had spoken at the Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| the plans could have been revised before they got to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| But again, the City Council can direct revisions and recommendations for changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| to the plan as it goes into the final planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| Okay. Thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| As I mentioned, the communication I did receive rather late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| and I would have probably called you before the meeting, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8583)|
| 2:23:07| Mayor, we do have one person who signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| Mr. James Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| Okay. Oh, that's an L, not an I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| Yes. I almost missed it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| Yeah. Mr. Waldrop, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| Excuse me, Mayor and Will. Council Member Parker has her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Why don't you go ahead and then we'll get to the public speaker after you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| Well, I just wanted to clarify the process because this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| a development that I've tried to follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| And when this came to us as a planned development with new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8624)|
| 2:23:48| it seemed a new process attached to it, it was a surprise to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| And so it was helpful for me to hear from Councilwoman Ryder that this is the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| that a planned development has come to the City Council since free code was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| So I'm not sure how we, whether we should really expect the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| to be experts on the process. And this is new to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| And I also wanted to clarify when Director Green said this was before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8651)|
| 2:24:19| the Planning Commission, whether he was speaking of the meeting that just recently happened in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8659)|
| 2:24:29| 2020. Is that the meeting that you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| That's correct. And this project was noticed through signs on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| through notice on the Planning Commission preliminary final agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| through postcards to the property owners and through a legal notice in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| The applicant sponsored a community meeting and the Planning Commission meeting was announced at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| that meeting. So the Planning Commission meeting was noticed pretty heavily to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| Thank you for that. I just, I do want to lift up, you know, that many people are still sheltering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| in place. I'm one of those folks, a postcard to my home may have reached me, but many of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8707)|
| 2:25:15| neighbors may not see those signs as much. So I think it would be good for us to show a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| grace and patience as our neighbors are learning a new process. And I have other questions, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8720)|
| 2:25:34| going to let the speaker at public forum go forward as I think on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| Okay. Mr. Waldrop, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8741)|
| 2:25:51| Mr. James Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| Mayor, he is not unmuted himself. There is a caller that has raised their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8754)|
| 2:26:02| Perhaps he's had issues with his, I'll enable the caller to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| Yes, this is James Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| Okay. Mr. Waldrop, you could just start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| and then you have up to five minutes to speak. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8775)|
| 2:26:21| Thank you, Mayor. My name is James Waldrop. I live at 1710 East 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| just down the block from this project. I'm sure most of you are in the last few meetings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8785)|
| 2:26:32| First, I'd like to begin by stating that I can't believe that any public servant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8792)|
| 2:26:36| Gerald Green especially, saying that it's disingenuous for public input at any point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| in this process. And my blood pressure is so high about that I may ramble. So please excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| I'd like to say that during this process, the neighborhood has been treated as an enemy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| be conquered at any cost instead of a partner. We've never said that we absolutely want this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| under any cost. We have simply said time and time again, to please include us and let us know so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| can help shape this to fit our neighborhood. And we have not gotten anything other than lip service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8822)|
| 2:27:09| There's only been three public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| Let's see, one was a Zoom meeting. That last one was a Zoom meeting. And so only the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| could figure out how to use this, which I'm still trying myself to figure out, were able to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| it. The other two meetings were only presentations. And the fact that Mr. Green said that no one spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8841)|
| 2:27:28| at the neighborhood is at the NPC meeting was simply because we couldn't keep up when it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| It was moved, postponed, and then it was moved again. And so we have not gotten anything other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| than that. And then it was on online meeting. And well, quite frankly, that's just too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8860)|
| 2:27:46| to keep up with. So during this COVID-19 period, and to use that as an excuse that no one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8866)|
| 2:27:53| no one showed up to speak about it, especially after the way this neighborhood has been treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| And if he is, I would have to say Mr. Green is disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8877)|
| 2:28:05| And because of COVID-19 as a neighborhood, we have not been able to meet as we normally do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| nor have any of the churches or other gathering places where this can be discussed have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| meeting. So it's been really difficult to discuss it. I'm sure if council members and the mayor were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8895)|
| 2:28:25| to walk the idyllic streets of Park Ridge or even most of East Oxville and ask detailed questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| about this project to any passerby, they would likely get one or two answers. We've been lied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| to and they're going to do what they want, like always, or I have no idea what you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| about. And that points to the lack of information that we had from VMC and from the city. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8920)|
| 2:28:48| only way we've been able to obtain information on this at all is through open records requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| And in fact, some of us in the 1700 block went and performed an open records request to THDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8932)|
| 2:29:02| in order to ascertain more information about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8942)|
| 2:29:10| And we cover many interesting things about this project in the city. And one of those was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8950)|
| 2:29:18| including the THDA was calling in the project into question as evidence from correspondence we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8958)|
| 2:29:26| obtained from the board of directors for VMC to Joe Bethel, who is the multifamily coordinator for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| THDA. And he asked for supporting documentation for the site plan and pointed out that the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8972)|
| 2:29:40| zoning doesn't support the plan structure. And it also noted that VMC lost points in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8980)|
| 2:29:47| process because they submitted a plan that wasn't the original rehabilitation and reuse of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| existing building, but instead completely new construction. Another excerpt from that email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=8992)|
| 2:30:01| chain, Mr. Bethel asking again, he doesn't know if the zoning will allow for the project and he'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9001)|
| 2:30:08| ask for clarification from the zoning process. He says, I have to look back at the whole thing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9008)|
| 2:30:15| because this is not what I was thinking when I received the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| I especially need to review the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| So if THDA who is receiving the application and is well versed in this is confused about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9023)|
| 2:30:29| project, what in the world is the neighborhood doing about it? I mean, it's just unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9029)|
| 2:30:35| to expect us to be exact experts on all this and follow it to the T when a lot of this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9035)|
| 2:30:41| is simply trying to survive and wondering when unemployment is going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9041)|
| 2:30:45| You have about 30 seconds left, Mr. Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| Thank you. If laws meant to protect neighborhoods against development did not apply in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9048)|
| 2:30:53| Knoxville, why is that? We may be so bold to venture that at this critical time of national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9053)|
| 2:30:58| conversations about equal treatment under the law in the American community. Why is one developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| pursuing a project in a minority community being given a free pass to skirt laws that are supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| to protect everyone equally? Why is East Knoxville the Tuskegee Airmen for RICO? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9068)|
| 2:31:13| times demand we take the time to get this right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| Ms. Parker, Ms. Welch was going to speak to some of these things unless you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| had a follow up comment at this juncture. No? Okay. Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9087)|
| 2:31:35| Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to maybe clarify a couple of points and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| note that Bruce Bangler is on the phone and may be able to give some updates regarding their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9101)|
| 2:31:51| the process that VMC is going through. So we've had just in the past several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9111)|
| 2:31:57| there have been a couple of community meetings about this particular project. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| was an in-person meeting. It was pre-COVID in February and there was good community participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9123)|
| 2:32:10| lots of concerns expressed about the project that I think we did our best to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9130)|
| 2:32:18| There were several items that came to council that were either modified or the plans changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9138)|
| 2:32:26| over the full course of the project, including assuring that the open space is going to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9146)|
| 2:32:34| open space and part of the park, including some changes in the way that the street closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9154)|
| 2:32:42| the Myrtle Street closure will be happening and leaving half of that street available to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9162)|
| 2:32:49| a green space and accessible to the park. So I hope that some of those considerations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9169)|
| 2:32:59| recognized by members of council and by the community. Also, there was a community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9179)|
| 2:33:05| on April 23rd. Not only was the plan presented to the neighborhood, and I realized that was a Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9185)|
| 2:33:12| meeting, definitely not an ideal time to be holding community process. We are all in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9192)|
| 2:33:19| where we're making the best of that. I will say that that Zoom meeting was as well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9199)|
| 2:33:26| There were as many people on the Zoom meeting as came to the in-person meeting prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9206)|
| 2:33:31| The VMC presented a preliminary site plan and we went over in detail the plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9211)|
| 2:33:41| Which was really intended to address a concern raised by the community about rezoning the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9221)|
| 2:33:47| property. There was some concern about rezoning the property because if for some reason the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9227)|
| 2:33:54| project with the VMC didn't go forward, the neighborhood I think rightfully felt some strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| concern that rezoning it would leave it open to another type of development that may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9240)|
| 2:34:07| something that the neighborhood wanted. So plan development seemed like a good way to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| that would allow the property to remain in its base zone and would allow this project to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9253)|
| 2:34:21| forward. So there have been several open community meetings and then the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9261)|
| 2:34:29| process which included notification of the planning commission meeting, notification of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9269)|
| 2:34:35| this meeting, there will be another notice meeting of planning commission to review this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9275)|
| 2:34:42| project. So hopefully that kind of sheds some light on the amount of community process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9282)|
| 2:34:49| that's involved in plan development in general and this project in particular. And Mayor, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| wanted to note again that Bruce Fangler is on the phone if anybody had any questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9296)|
| 2:35:01| Ms. Fangler, head of VMC. Council members, does anyone have any questions for Ms. Welch or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| Ms. Fangler? Mr. Spangler, sorry. Ms. Ryder, yeah. If no one else has a question I just thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9307)|
| 2:35:14| I'd ask. I have a question about the time frame for the plan development approval but I'll ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| Mr. Spangler first. What is the time frame for this project at this point? Yes ma'am, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9319)|
| 2:35:28| anticipating closing on the property with positively living on the middle of August and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| then we will work diligently to provide temporary relocation for those 13 residents there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| continue to serve them during the demolition as well as construction of the building. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| we would hope we have to have the plans definitely through the planning commission as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| engineering. And so we would hope to break ground probably about late part of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9353)|
| 2:36:00| We're looking at a construction time frame of maybe 12 to 14, 15 months thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9360)|
| 2:36:07| That's where we are. I would like to say two quick things is that during this COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9367)|
| 2:36:14| the directives to safe at home or safer at home really underscores the value of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9374)|
| 2:36:22| And this project begins to address the needs of folks who are really, really struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9382)|
| 2:36:28| And so I appreciate everyone's support on that. Second of all, relative to THDA, we did submit an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9388)|
| 2:36:35| application for their innovation round which is a competition of sorts. Our application was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9395)|
| 2:36:43| accepted and we did present before THDA for that innovation round of low income tax credits at 9%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9403)|
| 2:36:51| and we successfully received those tax credits. And so in that competitive process, we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9411)|
| 2:36:58| demonstrate how innovative as well as the enhancement in all the services and the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9418)|
| 2:37:07| in which it is designed. So I felt a great accomplishment from my team in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9427)|
| 2:37:14| presenting to THD and those core members and I was excited with that award. But I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9434)|
| 2:37:21| gets at some of your questions, Councilwoman Ryder as well as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9441)|
| 2:37:26| Thank you, Mr. Spangler. Ms. Ryder, any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| So the question for Mr. Green, so the timeframe for any plan development, because this is new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9449)|
| 2:37:37| process for the community, some of the concerns that were emailed to Council today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9457)|
| 2:37:43| obviously because they missed the opportunity to give their comments before the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9463)|
| 2:37:49| However, you might want to characterize that. The next step is contingent upon the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9469)|
| 2:38:01| and they, when they have a final plan, meaning when the applicant is ready to go, they make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| an application to the Planning Commission and that goes to a public notice and meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9485)|
| 2:38:12| That's correct. And the preliminary agenda would be at 21 days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| The legal add about 15 days before the meeting, the postcards back to the adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9500)|
| 2:38:28| 12 days before the meeting, the signs are posted at least 15 days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| The final agenda is a week before the meeting with full packet of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| Okay. And then those decisions and the review of that final plan, the public can make comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9519)|
| 2:38:51| because the preliminary agenda is out there and it will be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| Then are those decisions final with MPC or does something come back to Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9535)|
| 2:39:00| Those are final with the Planning Commission, the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9540)|
| 2:39:05| unless there's an appeal to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| Okay. All right. Thank you for clarifying that process, just because this is new to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9549)|
| 2:39:13| and it's new to the public. I know the members of the public, when I look at the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| it says stuff about landscaping, final landscaping. Some of the questions we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9558)|
| 2:39:23| were about that. And so there was an understanding that it wasn't going back through a public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9563)|
| 2:39:28| there was no more public vetting of this past this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| Okay. So the plan, even the preliminary plan has been revised based on some comments from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9573)|
| 2:39:41| public. The comments from the public that we received via email addressed some architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| concerns about the initial building design and landscaping. The landscaping plan was enhanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| and there's a preliminary landscape plan with the preliminary plan, but it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| address all the concerns. The architecture was enhanced significantly in response to public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9598)|
| 2:40:05| comments from the plan first submitted to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| Okay. I just want to make the point, this is, my comment is not about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9609)|
| 2:40:15| My comments, and I'll reserve some of my comments to when we have a workshop and talk about plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| development, because it's been raised multiple times as potential solution for even a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9619)|
| 2:40:27| in the fourth district. This project in particular, not about this project, but as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9627)|
| 2:40:34| this originally would look at a rezone to allow the number of units as well as a one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9634)|
| 2:40:43| Plan development gets into what I think is kind of a gray area with contract zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9643)|
| 2:40:50| which is governed by the state. And it includes variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9650)|
| 2:40:58| the ability to make variances and other things based on public benefits. Is that correct, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9658)|
| 2:41:06| Green? That's correct, except for the issue about conditional zoning. As Ms. Walsh said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9666)|
| 2:41:14| this does not change the zoning of the property. So it offers some protection to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| and only the project that's, if this is approved by city council, it's the only thing that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| built. If a rezoning occurred, then this project could go away and- Then what happens to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9685)|
| 2:41:33| building? The corporation could build a 48-unit or 50-unit apartment complex on that property. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9693)|
| 2:41:40| this provides additional protection. It also provides a more intense level of review than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9700)|
| 2:41:47| a typical rezoning request. So it provides for that opportunity for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9707)|
| 2:41:54| public to be engaged. And I apologize if you felt I was a bit critical of the public, but as I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9714)|
| 2:42:01| said over and over again, democracy is a participatory sport and we all have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| attention to what happens in our neighborhood. And the planning commission's planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| do a great job of trying to notify the public. In this instance, as Ms. Walsh said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| there were two community meetings prior to the submission to the review of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| by the planning commission. The planning commission meeting at which this plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9740)|
| 2:42:24| to be reviewed was announced at those meetings. So there was a great deal of opportunity. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9744)|
| 2:42:30| public, again, has an opportunity at this meeting to weigh in and provide comments. At the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9750)|
| 2:42:36| plan review at planning commission, there's an opportunity for the public to be engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| So this process goes far beyond a typical rezoning in terms of the opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9761)|
| 2:42:48| public input and the assurance that what is said at this meeting is what's developed on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9768)|
| 2:42:56| So real quickly, I'm not going to hog the mic. I'm going to turn it over. I see Ms. Parker with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| her hands raised. I think these have been trying times for everyone, Mr. Green. And I think I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| speak for other people. Blanketly, paying attention to public process as a public sport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9786)|
| 2:43:12| can sometimes be a full-time job. So it's hard. It's something that I was only able to juggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9792)|
| 2:43:20| at times in my life when I didn't have an outside the home job and I was home with my kids. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9800)|
| 2:43:24| that's my defense of other people. Anyway, neither here nor there, I'm not going to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9804)|
| 2:43:29| Plan development, my issues with it, not about this project, but also pertaining to anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| that comes forward to us with plan development is a way to, it's a rezone without a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9815)|
| 2:43:41| And I'm concerned about how many times it's coming to us. It's variances and a multitude of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9821)|
| 2:43:48| things based on, anyway, we'll get into it at a workshop. I'm not going to tie it to this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| item. There were concerns that were sent to all of us about the trees. Will those things be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| to be addressed? There's a review of, there's a city tree ordinance. Will that be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9838)|
| 2:44:04| and applied the next time? Casey Krause has provided comments regarding that and the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9844)|
| 2:44:12| trees on the site have been reviewed and it's part of the plan review by Mr. Krause and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| continue to be reviewed. The landscape plan that has been presented goes beyond what's required by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9859)|
| 2:44:26| the ordinance. The positive aspect of the plan development process is that the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9866)|
| 2:44:32| commission and the city council can require more than the base standards of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9872)|
| 2:44:39| and the plan review and approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| Mr. Krause is on the call if he wants. Casey Krause, are you on the call? I see your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9882)|
| 2:44:51| I don't know if that means you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| Yeah, I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| If there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| Yeah, Ms. Ryder, I mean, did someone have a particular question about the trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| I think you already reviewed that concern that someone sent to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9903)|
| 2:45:10| Tell us what you learned from that review or your conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| Yeah, I actually was just introduced to this project recently, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| I did get out there and reviewed the trees as they pertain to the tree protection ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9919)|
| 2:45:26| And based on some of the comments and feedback I got, I think there's minimal concerns as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| as the public trees go at this point in time. There was one concern about a tree along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| street right of way. That particular tree is in poor health as it is stands right now. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| as far as the property, it butts to the rear of the property in the park. Most of the impact is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9942)|
| 2:45:49| going to be over existing asphalt or concrete where minimal impact to the trees would exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9949)|
| 2:45:56| So as of right now, I think more details when the final plan comes out would be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| you know, final grading plans, things like that for if any need to enact any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9962)|
| 2:46:09| aspects of the tree protection ordinance at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| Thank you, Mr. Krause. Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| I think that I have a lot more questions. I'll say that for the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| that pretty much answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| Okay. Any other questions? Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| Yeah, just on this specific item, the important thing to me is regardless of what's happened in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=9993)|
| 2:46:40| the past, there's still an opportunity coming up for there to be some public input. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10000)|
| 2:46:46| I would just urge the parties to take advantage of that opportunity. I know Mr. Stangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10006)|
| 2:46:51| would assert himself with an open mind and the planning commission. And so let's just take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10011)|
| 2:46:57| advantage of this opportunity that we still have and try to settle whatever differences that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10017)|
| 2:47:03| can. And I appreciate Mr. Krause's information about the trees because that was one of the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| concerns. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. I'll just add that as we address issues facing our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10028)|
| 2:47:18| unsheltered population, permanent supportive housing is a big part of the answer. And so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10038)|
| 2:47:24| want to thank council for supporting permanent supportive housing. I want to thank VMC and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| board members and all the people who donate to your efforts and our community development or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10049)|

| 2:47:39| It works. It's working at Menville. It's working at Flanagan. And it's more than just a roof over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10059)|
| 2:47:46| people's heads. It's support. It's for people who might otherwise be in mental health facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10066)|
| 2:47:53| that have been shut down. And this is part of what is going to make our city stronger and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| equitable. And it's rebuilding that social safety net that's been undermined over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10078)|
| 2:48:05| decade. So I want to thank everybody for the support of permanent supportive housing. It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| huge part of the answer to some of our biggest challenges. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| Ms. Parker? No? Okay. Anyone else? Okay, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200616?start=10096)|
