| 0:00:46| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| Tonight's devotional, I'll call on Commissioner Charles Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| Sometimes we get instructions from the Bible, and I'm going to be reading from 1 Corinthians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| 3, 16 through 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| It says, Do you know that yourselves are of God's temple, and that God's Spirit lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=64)|
| 0:01:11| in you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| And no one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| For God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| Do not deceive yourselves if anyone thinks that he is wise by the standards of the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| He has become a fool so that he must become a fool so he can be wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| For the wisdom of the world is foolishness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| In God's sight, as it is written, he catches the wise in their craftedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| And again, the Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| So then no more boasting about men, all things are yours, whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=107)|
| 0:01:55| the world, the life, or death, or the present, or the future, all are yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| You are of Christ, and Christ is of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| But Paul also tells us that all this is for naught when you go down to verse 1 Corinthians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=127)|
| 0:02:17| 13, 2 through 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| If you have the gift of prophecy, and if I understand all of God's secrets, plans, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| possess all knowledge, and if all I had so much faith that I could move mountains, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| do not love others, I have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| If I give everything to the poor and sacrifice my body and boast about it, but if I do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| have love, I would have gained nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| And I want to tell you about a story about this college professor that had this sociology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=169)|
| 0:02:57| class, and this college class was in Baltimore, and he sent his students out to get case studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| of 200 young men, young boys, and they were asked to write evaluations of each boy's future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=185)|
| 0:03:14| and in each case the student wrote, he hasn't got a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| 25 years later another sociology professor came across this earlier study, and he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| his students to follow up on the project to see what had happened to these boys, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| the exception of 20 of the boys who had moved away or died, the students learned that 176| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| of the remaining 180 had achieved more success than the ordinary people being lawyers, doctors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=218)|
| 0:03:47| and businessmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| The professor was astounded and decided to pursue this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Fortunately, all the men were in the area, and he asked each one of them, how do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| account for your success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| In each case, the reply came with feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| There was a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| The teacher was still alive, so he sought out and asked the old but alert lady what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| magical formula she had used to pull these boys out of the slums into this achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=254)|
| 0:04:23| With a sparkling eyes and her lips broken to a gentle smile, it really is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=263)|
| 0:04:31| She said, I love those boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Oh Lord Jesus, thank you for being the example of living obedience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| Empower us with your spirit to make decisions based on your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| In your holy name I pray, Jesus Christ, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Commissioner Anders, would you lead us and our guests in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| I stand to give proper salute to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=308)|
| 0:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Chairman, I know we've got a big, full audience of lots of folks who are here to visit us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| and to be recognized, and I know we've got an audience of folks who are watching this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| meeting at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| My fellow commissioners know I like to do this at the meeting, but for many of you this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| may be your first time attending a county commission meeting, so I'd like to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| a very brief overview of how these processes work and how we got here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| First of all, county commission meets twice a month for our two formal meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Last Monday night, excuse me, last Tuesday night, we had our county commission work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| session where we took our first pass through this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| We debated quite a few of the items, and some of the items were passed and placed on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| So tonight you will notice that there will be a couple of times where we will vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| multiple items with one vote after the county clerk has read those items into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| Other items were sent forward from the work session to have the actual vote take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Some of the items were sent forward to tonight's meeting with no recommendation, so that final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| decision will be made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Also, as I said at the work session last week, we had quite a few presentations last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| and as I said, in honor of or in respect to folks who may be here to give us a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| some of those pressing items, I'm going to move to the top of the agenda to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| of those presentations, discussions, and our most pressing votes taken care of at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| of the agenda before we get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| I will say this for everyone's benefit, we do have quite a few items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| I think in my four years on county commission, this is one of the longer agendas with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| most debate that I've seen in my four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| So anyhow, that's kind of how we got here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| Also, next we're going to have public forum, and then we will set the agenda before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| I've got three citizens who have contacted us in advance to speak at public forum, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| I will call on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| However, they did indicate the topic that they wanted to speak at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| Two of them wanted to speak about the sidewalk ordinance, which is actually further on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| our agenda, and one of whom wanted to speak about Beverly Road, which is a zoning matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| which comes up at the zoning meeting, and one of the county growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| I'll give all three of you a chance, if you want to speak now, you can for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| However, I will be happy to grant you the opportunity to speak on these items when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| get to them on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| So is Sherry Raymond here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Sherry, if you could raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| I think she actually called into the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| Is Sherry in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Just by a raise of your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| I don't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| Maybe she realizes that she'll show up later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Also, Brenda Patton and Caroline Cooley, both of you all expressed interest in speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| on sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Ms. Cooley, you said when the item comes up, but I didn't get that clarification from Brenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| Patton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Is Brenda here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Brenda, do you want to speak about that item now, or when we're actually discussing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| item in the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Seeing no other folks who have expressed an interest in public forum, unless there's someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| here tonight, I'm going to move forward on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| So on our agenda, we're at the point now where we actually set tonight's agenda, and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| the benefit of the public and my fellow commissioners, I want to clarify a few things that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=517)|

| 0:24:57| is there to provide counsel and advice, not to make policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1497)|

| 0:25:11| I'd like to thank everyone in my office, PBA and others who have worked so hard on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1511)|

| 0:25:22| I realize this is a complex matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I'd like to thank all of you for your consideration and the time that you have spent on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you, and I'm sure that you will make the best decision for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| I'll do my best to recognize every person in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Commissioner Gill, your line was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| We received an e-mail, and I would like to make a substitute motion to take a look at the additional changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| that were made to the resolution that is in our agenda so that we can begin to discuss that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| So the original motion came from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| The second was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Yeah, so we've got the second, so you're good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| So we have a substitute motion before us, and that was, I believe it was that e-mail clarified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| to take a look at the separate, which had everything broken out and itemized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| So if I may, let's look at the substitute motion that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| that the resolution is coming from Knox County Commission authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| and administering the agent on behalf of the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| and looking at a complete list of items under Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| And the second biggest issue under Second Four is the document execution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| which is to be delivered by September 30, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| and have an opportunity to discuss those items because I know Mr. Mametoff is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| and any other additional questions and outstanding observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Because this particular resolution placed some clarifying language in Section Two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| that we just need to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Is there a second for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| That was Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| So what is now on the floor is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Now, moving in order, Commissioner Schoonmaker, then I recognize Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Well, I guess as the follow-up to the mayor's statement, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| these are the documents that we've received to decide on about this, the TBA towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| I guess at this point I'd just like to hear from our attorney, the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| as far as what his take is on all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| First off, I'd like a little clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| The substitute motion is the resolution now that was handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Because it has a little better foundation than the one you had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| The law director's issues, and one of them I think is being cleared up as we speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| President Boyd and I had a discussion earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| and I had an issue related to, a legal issue related to our agreement with UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| and so he's going to send me some paperwork I'm sure that's going to satisfy that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| So I no longer have that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| We have some issues related to assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| I think that the overall contracts, we're still working on clarity between easements and leases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| and leases greater than five years is what I'm waiting on from TVA to actually give me an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:59| that clarifies that you can use these permanent easements for main buildings and apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| That's just a concern I have to make sure that the taxpayers are protected in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| And I think that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| They've sent a draft over the weekend, which was not quite there, but we're still working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| The major piece left that we're still negotiating on has to do with an assignment with the Summer Place Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| and that has to do with a multiyear lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| I think they're in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Mark, you can help me with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| He's not listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| 15, 16, or 18th year, and I want to make sure that is still enforceable under federal law, and we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| It also has some indemnification clauses in it, and we cannot indemnify by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| So those are issues that the law director's office is still dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| We can only, and the mayor made it clear, and I made it clear to the mayor in writing back in October, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| these are the same issues that we've had on the table for over a year, and we've still been trying to get them cleared up with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| And I advised the mayor that our advice is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| What you all do as a legislative body deals with the what, and what is policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| The law director deals with the how, and how is the legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| And so we're still working on the legal form, but we do not work on the what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| And I think the mayor made that clear this evening, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| So those are the things that are still before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| We have a September deadline now to get those things cleared one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| We also have, I think, an illegality clause, which would, if things come out the wrong way, the taxpayers could be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1850)|
| 0:31:01| So we're still looking at that, and we're still in negotiations with TVA, and we're still working with Mark on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| So that's where the law director's office is at this point in time, and those are the three or four main issues that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:18| And TVA is working diligently to eliminate the indemnification clause in an assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| The assignment, it happens to do with someone leasing part of a building that we're going to end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| And in that assignment, TVA indemnified them, and they were kind of surprised, I believe, that they did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| And we can't do that, and they're working to get that excluded with the person that they have the lease with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| So that's where we stand right now, and everything else before this board is policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| and what you believe is in the best interest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| And then you, Commissioner Skoomaker, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| I've got one other question. I don't know if this is something Mr. Caldwell could – I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Do you have a question for Mr. Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Go ask it, but Skoomaker still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Since the subject was breached, I'm going to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| The indemnification clause is with the sublease of an entity that's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| That entity can indemnify TVA, can they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| No, it's the other way around. TVA indemnified them, and they're wanting to assign that lease to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| which means Knox County would indemnify them, and we cannot indemnify anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| So we're trying to get the indemnification clause removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| TVA's working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Knox County's not, but we cannot accept an assignment where we are forced to indemnify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| That's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| I was thinking it was more about the sublease he was wanting TVA to indemnify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| That the person that was occupying the building had to indemnify TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| No, it's the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| All right, back to you, Commissioner Skoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| And I just wanted to find out, did Senator Massey execute the letter to the Tennessee Attorney General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:19| And if so, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| Mr. Skoomaker, Mark Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| My understanding is that Senator Massey has sent an unsigned version to the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| to make sure the format was correct, and that once the Attorney General signs off on that or suggests changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| then she would submit the formal signed version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| I have not seen a signed copy yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Okay, so the process has been started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Definitely, it's been started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Yes, extensive discussions between myself, the law director, her legislative liaison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| and definitely a draft has been submitted to the Attorney General's office for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Commissioner Skoomaker, you're good there with your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| We've been looking over 200 pages of an easement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| It's a 15-year easement agreement, not a lease, not a purchase, but an easement agreement with the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| The cost is between, I don't know, I've heard anywhere from $30 to $40 million to get this move started for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| and some of the buildings that we're getting into, like the Summer Place building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| But this money is going to the federal government and not staying in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| It's taxpayers' money that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| We're not talking about just plain money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| It's taxpayers' that we're charged to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| And again, this easement is over 200 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| And it should be a simple line easement if we're going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| and not so complicated for our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| I know that we're going to be giving up our sovereignty of this body to be in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| because we don't have control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| And why would we want to move some of our best offices and things to those buildings that we don't have sovereignty over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| or have control over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| The taxpayers have no control over that building easement in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| And as of today, we're talking about either moving school offices or the mayor's offices to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:42| We're not sure who the tenant's going to be in that building as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| But what I do know is at the end of the 15 years, there will be a final cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| and we don't know what that final cost is going to be because each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| TVA has the right to audit their O&M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| It's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| We can't determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| And it is a federal government building, and we've talked about the getting in and out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| and how hard it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| And I was at the John Duncan Building this morning seeing my oldest granddaughter sworn in to the Air Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:33| It took me a little bit longer and more strenuous to get in that federal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| It's not going to be easy access for the taxpayers of Knox County, no matter what anybody says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| It's a federal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| It appears that we really want this building, but as of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| we really don't know a lot about what we're getting into as far as what we're going to have to give up to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2215)|
| 0:37:04| We've heard about TVA subleasing the top six floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| and I don't think we have a contract in hand right now if that's part of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| We may have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| I'm not sure, but we just don't have it in hand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:23| But that, again, is that contract with the University of Tennessee for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| like we're going to have to lease it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| We talk a lot about taxpayers' money for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| Is there a better way to utilize that money that we're going to be spending in non-county owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| non-purchased, non-leased property for the school systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Now, we've been told that the school system is going to get an extra million dollars a year to advance programs for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:56| They've got 60,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| You divide 60,000 into a million dollars, and you've got $16.68 a student per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| Is that worth giving up the school's sovereignty to move in that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Is that enough money to do the proper things for the kids that we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| What about if we just take the whole lease money that we're talking about that we're going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| and put it in in a way that we can take that full $20, $30 million, whatever it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| and put it into the schools for the betterment of the kids of this county, and that money stays here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:36| My deal as a commissioner of Knox County is to see the best use and the proper use of taxpayers' dollars of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| And I cannot cease giving a federal entity money that will go out of this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| and not stay here for the betterment of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| Yes, TVA has supported Knoxville in the past and has a lot of people employed in that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| but we have a total building that has not been utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| And what we're going to do is we're going to take that building off the federal government's hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| because it is a drain on the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| and we're going to supplant their money that they're using on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| It kind of bothers me, but the taxpayers ought to know that we're dealing with the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| and it scares me to death to deal with the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| And I know how I'm going to vote on this issue because of all those questions that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| about how the taxpayers of Knox County are going to be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| and is the schools going to be that much better for moving one building to another building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| What's the thing wrong with the building that they're in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Why can't we use that money again for projects that will improve reading, math, skills, science projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2390)|
| 0:40:02| I know that in one middle school, Gresham Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| the public is going to put $200,000 in to a science lab that the school system should be supplying for those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:16| But the parents themselves are going to use their own money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| So I can't see using this money just to move one office from another office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| And the deal may sound good, but it sure doesn't look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I have a question for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| Chris, we've heard a lot of numbers thrown out today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| $20 million, $30 million out of pocket to be sent off to Neverland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| What is the true yearly cost of the difference if the schools were to move to TVA Towers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:58| So going back to the presentation we did a couple of weeks ago, I'm trying to find the exact page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:08| We did a comparison of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| So currently operating expense to occupy the A.J. building is right at $885,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:27| When you look at what it's going to cost to occupy the East Tower, which is right at $840,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| and you take off the net revenue from UT for their top six floors, the parking revenue for UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:45| and the parking revenue for schools or county parkers, that annual savings alone is $400,000 just by making the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:58| It's a savings of $400,000 annually just by the added income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| And so I know there's a lot of numbers getting thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| So the cost of some replaces $1.6 million to purchase, as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| We estimate $2 million to renovate what we need it for, which includes a chiller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| And then there isn't a cost to get the easement off of the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:28| What we do is we have an easement amount of 37.5 cents a square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| and then we estimate that to occupy that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| So build out, which is demolition, FF&E, all the packages, is right at $10 million, 9.975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:53| So that is the total cost to get in the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And we even showed, if you'll remember a couple weeks ago, a projected cost on present value that showed over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:08| that basically we were making $4 million a year to do this transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| My next question is for Mr. Mametoff, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| Mr. Mametoff, we have discussed this at length on multiple occasions in meetings and publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| and I've had meetings probably with the mayor's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Do any attorneys, you know, TVA's looked at it, UT's looked at it, you've looked at it on behalf of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| Do you have the same issues that our law director has, or has anybody else found the same issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:50| Certainly in identification, there's attorney general opinion that says generally that the county can't identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| There's no real case law and there's no real statute, but there is an attorney general opinion on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| As I've said before this body several times, it's been very helpful that the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| has taken a very firm stand against identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| And there is an identification provision from TVA in favor of digital crossing in the lease that we would be assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| However, the resolution that you have specifically says we can't close and cannot assume that lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| unless that identification provision is removed, and TVA has been negotiating with them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| TVA doesn't want to obviously cut a final written deal with them and pay them money to give up the identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| unless they know that we're wanting to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| It would be like saying, hey, I've got two aces or two kings or whatever in playing poker until you're ready to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| So as soon as this is approved or disapproved, then they know whether to finalize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| But with consultation with the law director's office, we've added specific language in this resolution to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| your approval is subject to us getting that identification language removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| The thing that I think the big issue that the law director and I, I guess if there is a disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| is that will an easement work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And I came in front of you two weeks ago and I told you that I firmly believe that it essentially is acting like a lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| that you'll have all the protections that if you did a lease, it's just a lease by another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| You'll have the same possessory rights as a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| I've run this by as many good real estate lawyers as I have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| Am I making a bad judgment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| I certainly am not so arrogant to believe that I can't make a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| but I certainly have run it by a lot of people I respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| I brought in front of you all who I consider the best title attorney in the area to look at it for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| and I've had some of my other coworkers look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| And I feel very comfortable in the use of an easement versus a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| We have, and I'll hand out a copy to you, we're getting a clean opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| I do tons of transactional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| We're getting an opinion from TVA's general counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| She's looked it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| She signed off on it that we would get when we close that says that this is a legal instrument entered in by TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| does not conflict with anything else, any other laws, and that it will be enforceable against TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| That is, to me, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Again, I give credit to the law director's office for pushing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| I don't think, though, we're going to get anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| We're not going to get something that says an easement works from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| It's a judgment called to they're not going to pine that an easement is the same thing as a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| Again, in my judgment, you're getting what you need to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| and it's going to give you the protections you need to use the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| and I guess that may be where we slightly disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| But on the vast majority of issues, I think we do disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| and we've really worked hard, I think, to address, as the law director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| We've addressed the indemnity issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| The UT issue is really not a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| It's do you vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I mean, if I were the president and the CFO of UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| I wouldn't want to spend too much more time talking to me to negotiate a sub-easement unless I knew that we were moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| And so I think they have told me unequivocally at the law department, at the legal counsel's office at TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| that they've looked over the easement, that they are ready to sign essentially identical documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| to what we're signing with TVA for their six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| And so I don't know much more what I can ask for from them at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| Again, I'm glad to try to address any of the other legal issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| but I will sleep fine tonight, whatever you all decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| but I certainly will sleep fine from a legal perspective if you all proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| that I've done the best job I can to adequately protect the county as a citizen of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| I just wanted to make a statement that I think that a lot of work has been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| and I appreciate that President Boyd has come to us today to kind of affirm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| and also a potential with OR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| I don't know that we understand what we have the potential to have all of our educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| from the top scientists in the world down to our local school board sitting in the same building collaborating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| I don't think we could pay for that, and I think it's a great thing to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:26| Even some of the commissioners that are voting no have already said it's too good to be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| and I think that that's a sure sign that we're moving in the right direction with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| I'd like to yield to Commissioner Beeler for just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Commissioner Beeler, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Well, I usually preface my remarks at these meetings by saying I don't say much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| That may or may not be true after tonight, but assuming that we are probably going to vote on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| I do feel it necessary to clarify my position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| There's been a lot of speculation about what my position is since I have never stated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| I'm a processor by nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| I tend to not do a lot of talking but a lot of listening and a lot of research, processing, and praying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:25| For that reason, I don't often speak my mind in the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| I often process until I've made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| Perhaps the unfortunate thing is that I am, by personality, an agreeable person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| and so in the course of conversations where I am gathering information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| I may tend to speak agreement with the person who's talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| only to find later after processing that I don't agree with them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| I do want to say this before I speak to my position on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the phone calls I've received from some constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| just some friends that have told me that they're praying for me as I make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| This is a difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| It's a complex decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| We have wrestled with this for a number of months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| but I cannot tell you how that feels to know that you're being prayed for when you sit as a public official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:24| It reminded me of a scripture passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| and I know I don't have the devotional tonight, but I do need to say this before I make the rest of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| It reminded me of one of my favorite and one of the most profound passages in scriptures in the fifth chapter of Joshua.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| The Israelites have gone into the promised land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| and they're getting ready to have to take the city of Jericho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| And the night before the battle, Joshua walks out to kind of survey the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| survey what's going to be the battlefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| and he runs into a figure that turns out to be an angelic figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| the commander of the armies of the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| And Joshua asks him a question, and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Are you with us or our enemies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| Whose side are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| And the commander of the Lord's army answers, Neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| I find that quite interesting, that even to his covenant chosen people, Israel, the Lord said, Neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| I'm not on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| I'm not on your enemy's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| And that's what occurred to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| The Lord does not take sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| The Lord is a side, all his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| He calls all people to his side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| And for that reason, the Lord's got people on all sides of a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| The Lord's got people on both sides of the ocean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| The Lord's got people on both sides of the political aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| The Lord's got people on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| And I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| And I believe it's up to us, at least to me anyway, to seek his face and to seek peace about the decision that I make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| And there may be those who will not believe that that peace came from the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| They won't be the first to believe that something I said did not come from the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| When this issue first came to us back in, I guess it was September, October, it essentially had three components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| There was the TVA summer place easement, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| Then there was the potential sale of the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| And then there was, of course, the subsequent and potential move of the school system to the TVA East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:34| When all of those issues were lumped together, my first reaction was that I had issues with the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| My major issues had to do with two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| One was for this body to essentially vote to move the school system without their consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| I had a big problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| And the second problem, honestly, was whether or not we were getting the best possible price for the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| Still wrestling with that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| To his credit, our superintendent, Mr. Thomas, expressed some concerns that perhaps if the schools were asked to make this move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:09| what would be in it for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| If the schools, who had spent a lot of money on the AJ building over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| if they were asked to move to the TVA East Tower, would there be a savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| And if there were a savings, would the school system realize any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| And so to his credit, Mr. Thomas got with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| To the mayor's credit and his staff's credit, they worked out an arrangement where savings would be passed along to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| to their benefit, after which I believe I'm correct in saying Mr. Thomas expressed support for the deal and support for the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:45| And so where we are today is those issues have been separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| We're voting tonight on the TVA summer place easement, which I have come to believe is a fiscal savings for the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3230)|
| 0:54:00| I believe that's been well presented and documented by the mayor's staff, by all of those putting together the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| Our superintendent has stated that he supports moving the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| That'll be up to the school board, as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| We're not voting on that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Selling the AJ, I'm still processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| We're not voting on that tonight either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| So that's my position, and that's how I've arrived at it, and that's how I intend to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| As always with you, I always remind you, iron sharpens iron, and I thank you for being one of our irons here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Mr. Caldwell, if I could have a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Is there anything brought up tonight that hasn't been discussed, exhaustively reviewed, analyzed, answered, researched, done our due diligence on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:59| or has any further conversation that we haven't already been presented with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| You know, I sit back and think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| You know, we have been going through this process for many, many months, and we have examined contractual issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:25| You know, I commend Charlie's turkey and Bud's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| He's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| He and Mark have had really good talks with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| and I think both sides would tell you that these documents are better now because of both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| You know, our ability to have the mayor have conversations with President Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| and us forming a relationship there to, as Brad said, to have a chance at an unbelievable collaboration in one building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3349)|
| 0:56:01| I think it's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I think for us, the ability to get summer place parking garage with the square footage for $1.6 billion is really advantageous for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:19| and I think so much so that TVA was often contacted by the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| and maybe even the city of Knoxville about, oh, if the county doesn't do that deal, we'd like to have that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| I get that, Brad, and so that shows you that it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| So I think everything that we've examined has made this deal better, and everybody has worked hard and well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:45| Our team has worked hard on that, and I commend them because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| we've put together a great plan for a better ADA access and into the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| and we'll be working with Visit Knoxville on the Fritz lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| So it's a team effort, and I think it's better because of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| And I think, to answer your question, yes, I think every T has been crossed and I has been dotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| I don't know of anything else to this point that has not been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I have a question for Mr. Owings, if you wouldn't mind joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| I want to tee this up as to why I'm asking this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| I was in the Pension and Retirement Board meeting this afternoon with some of my fellow colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| and this topic came up in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And you might wonder why that topic is cross-pollinated with the Pension and Retirement Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| But what we learned and discussed was the Pension and Retirement Board rents space in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| just as a sublease would in any other building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| And if, for some reason, we were to move forward with this and the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| that was not resolved for the school system to go over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| and there were other offices that were looked to fill that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| that the Pension and Retirement Board and the staff there might be an entity that would likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| or have the potential to move over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| And so we have legal counsel on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| That is a separate independent entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| And one of our legal counsel is represented by Mr. Owings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| who was the former Knox County Law Director at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| And I would like for you to just essentially repeat our question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| We asked, do you find this in legal order and do you find this in legal form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| And I just would like for you to repeat what you presented to our board this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| I probably want to state your name for the record here as well, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Yes, it's John Owings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| I'm with Owings, Wilson & Coleman at 800 Riverview Tower here in Knoxville, just across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| I've been an attorney for 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| I entered the Knox County Law Director's Office with Richard Beeler back in 1990| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| when the charter was brand new, day one of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| So we reviewed a number, and I was with the Knox County Law Director's Office for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| We reviewed a number of contracts, certainly, during that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| two or three hundred a year, four hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| Bud, you're probably 450 or five by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| Believe it or not, John, we're up to almost 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| And I have a great deal of respect for Bud Armstrong as well as for Mark Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| Mark Mamentoff and I, we work out of the same building, and we share a lot of the same clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| We do a lot of bond issues together in different capacities, and I respect his opinion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| In reviewing these contracts for the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:06| which has long looked at space outside of the confines of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| to which the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board leases space from Knox County, from PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| just like other outside entities might, the credit union comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| We have long looked at other space, other more accessible space, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| So this issue has come up quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| In reviewing these contracts, first of all, the indemnity and hold harmless provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:45| they shout at us municipal-type attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| It's Tennessee Attorney General Opinion 93-01, and the Attorney General for the state said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| thou shalt not agree to indemnify and hold harmless if you're a governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| We long had that opinion before the Attorney General came out with his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| So we have lived with that through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| and I understand there's a provision within these documents that has that clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| But in looking at these, if that provision is struck from these agreements and taking them as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:35| given my experience with these documents, with these type agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| I don't find that there's a legal issue where I could advise my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| that these leases aren't legally suitable for the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board to lease space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| or to sublease space, so long as those issues are fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| And so that was my advice today, very publicly, to the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| After review of these documents, of course, the documents that I reviewed were the documents intended for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| I reviewed those as if they were intended for the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| Thank you, Mr. Ewings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:35| You mentioned something very quickly I'd like for you to go back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| You mentioned that in this resolution that is under a motion and second as presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:46| that there are some safeguards that have to do with if what seems to be the last little thing isn't resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:56| we can't move forward, or if there's a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| There's a couple of sort of safeguards of moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| If you could just please explain those real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Well, the key one is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| And bring your microphone down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| I'm not as tall as some, particularly the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| I think the one, it's funny how identification has become such a big issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| but the one place that identification appears is not in any of our agreements with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| It's in the Digital Crossing lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Digital Crossing, legal name is Nexus something, but everyone knows it as Digital Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| For some inexplicable reason, TVA, and probably slipped by some attorney there at TVA who's had his hand slapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| or her hand slapped, TVA agreed to cross-identify Digital Crossing for certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| It's in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| And when we all looked it over, we said, whoa, what's that doing in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| And they said, whoa, we don't know what it's doing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| We need to get that out of there, even if we don't do this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| And they said, well, but we're not going to pursue that while you all decide to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| And then we said, well, we're not going to close until you get that out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| And they said, okay, we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| We have to get that out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| So they've been working on it, as I mentioned before, and it's basically coming down to money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| Okay, how much are you going to pay us to take it out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| And so TVA is going to have to do that to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| and your resolution specifically says that we will not close until that is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| So that identification issue in my mind is resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| because you are not authorizing us to close as long as that identification language is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| And so the mayor is not authorized to sign the documents until that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| Also, another safeguard we put in there, as the law director mentioned, is there is a ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| and the digital crossing lease was originally five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| and I thought it was a great question, the law director and Charlie Sturkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| who I can't say enough nice things about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| I mean, Charlie is my new BFF, as they say, because we spend so much time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| They said, well, how did they ‑‑ why can't they lease to us just like they did to digital crossing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| And so I said, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Let's go ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| And so they said, well, we did what we don't want to do for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| is we had to put it up for public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| So they actually put up that space in that building for public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| They sent us a copy of the notice, and it was for a five‑year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| Again, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| Charlie and Bud said, well, where does it say that they can extend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Well, it was in the print below that it said that it will be a five‑year lease plus three five‑year options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| And so TVA did give notice in the auction that that would be a five‑year lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| plus three five‑year options when they put that up for public bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| And digital crossing, as you might guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| there's not a ton of bidders for Class C office space in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| and digital crossing won the bid, and they took that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| The problem with here is why we can't do that is they can't put the garage up for public bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| separately from the space in the TVA east tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| You're going to have tons of people bidding lots of money for the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| and then you're going to have no one wanting to bid on the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| That's why they're willing to give it to us for 37.5 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| And so you can't pair the two together using leases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and that's why they're wanting to use the easement route instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| Do you have any indication that TVA and digital crossing will not be able to resolve that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| I have no indication whatsoever they won't be able to resolve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| and we won't move ahead without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| And sort of as a fail safe measure, and this was not because Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| was promoting this resolution, I want to be clear about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| but I thought he made an excellent suggestion to put a sunset provision in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| So we also put a September 30th sunset in this resolution to keep the feet to the fire on TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| to say, look, we want to get this closed up, buttoned up as quickly as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| but we can't wait around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| You need to get this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| The reason we use September 30th is that's the end of their fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| and basically, look, if you can't get this resolved during your current fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| So we put the September 30th sunset date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| I originally put June 30th in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Commissioner Gill and I talked about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| I'm confident it will be resolved well before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| but that gives us plenty of time to get a response from the Attorney General's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| so we know what's going on with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| It gives us plenty of time to address that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| which I really am confident that we're going to resolve any custody and control issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| We've talked to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| They don't seem to have a problem with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| It's purely a legal one, and I do believe that we're going to get that resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| So we have two fail safes in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Last question I have for you, Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| In your legal opinion, is this resolution before us and properly motioned and second in legal order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| In my opinion, it is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| I mean, it is, and I think the form of the resolution is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| I think, again, the law director can speak for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| I think his main reservation still is the easement versus the lease concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| We've done all we can on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| We have a safeguard in there that allows this resolution to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| and if that is not resolved, it cannot move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Well, that's what I want to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| The easement for the lease issue, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| We're going to get an easement, and if you don't want an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| there's nothing we can do about it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| I mean, that is what you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| I believe it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| I believe it gives you what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| But I certainly greatly, for example, respect Commissioner Bussler's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| If you don't believe an easement gives you what you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| then I understand that it's a friendly disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| As Commissioner Buehler said, this is not about enemies and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| I feel like I've gotten no bud so much better as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I feel like I've developed a new friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| We just respectfully disagree on this one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you, Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| I've said very publicly for a long time during this process that I think that this is an excellent opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| for us to save the taxpayers in Knox County a tremendous amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| to move things forward in a way that's smart, fiscally responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| and to allow us an opportunity to build, really begin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| really tackling some of the much, much bigger issues in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| I think this is a tremendous, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| I know the tremendous amount of work that's been put in by everyone involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| And I'm going to yield to Commissioner Smith, who I don't believe has talked on this subject yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| Actually, Commissioner Jay, I haven't weighed in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| So Smith has spoken earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Well, I'm going to yield, but I would encourage my—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Commissioner Smith will be next, and then I'm going to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| and then both Gil and Bussler have expressed an interest in speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| but they had already spoken, so we'll circle back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| So just everybody's on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| I will yield to Mr. Bussler first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| bearing in mind that Robert's rules of time allowed to speak on the second round, and to you as well, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| So Commissioner Smith yields the floor to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| I was going to make an ending statement, but I'm going to yield back to you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| We've had numerous meetings and discussions about this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| We've met individually with the members of the finance team, purchasing, everybody that can meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| Personally, in my analysis, this is a very good deal that gives us a lot of different opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| for the future of Knox County and a way to save taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| With that being said, Mr. Chairman, I call for a vote on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| The question has been called with a second, so we have the vote called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| For those of you who may be watching for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| according to Robert's rules of order, when the question gets called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| we do have a vote on the question being called, and then if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| then after that we will proceed immediately to the vote on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| So just to clarify that, so we have a call to question from Commissioner Smith with a second that was from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| sorry, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| So we'll now proceed with the, so to clarify on what you're voting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| if you vote for yes and this passes with a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| then the question is successfully called and the next vote will be to vote on the resolution at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| and the discussion is cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Does everybody understand and does everybody in the audience understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| So for those of you who may be watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| So I'm going to make this a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| So, Madam Clerk, where are we starting on our roll call order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4291)|

| 1:18:54| Mr. Gill, that's got all the attachments right into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| I also want to clarify for those in the audience, Mr. Mametoff asked me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| Mark, would you kind of restate what you said to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| If I'm incorrect, please feel free to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| I believe Ms. Gill made the motion to substitute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| I believe Mr. Smith seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| But this vote, I think, is even is on the substitution, not the actual motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| So I just want to make sure that everyone understood what I thought was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| And since this is such an important issue to everyone, I just want to make sure that procedurally we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| getting it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| So I think this is the vote to accept Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| And I got to recognize Ms. Gill spent a couple of hours with me helping me try to write this into plain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4773)|

| 1:19:39| To clarify, at least in my point of order on this for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| I think this should be handled like any other substitute motion that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4787)|

| 1:19:55| But to clarify, back to your point, is the motion that is before us is a substitute motion presented by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4801)|

| 1:20:52| So that is, I just want to get clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| So we voted in the affirmative for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| So back to Mr. Mametoff's question, I mean, are we done on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| Do we now need to vote again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| That was Mark's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| The question was called for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| The substitute motion on the resolution was voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| The announcement was 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| It passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| So just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| So thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Just, Mark, you threw me off with that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| Madam clerk, next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| We appreciate your work, Mark, on that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Thank you for your help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| As well as Mr. Caldwell's, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Madam clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| Would it be possible, while the crowd dissipates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| that we could take a five-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| We've got a short presentation real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Yeah, we've got a short presentation next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| I also, before everyone leaves, Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| I'm just trying to get Biggs out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| I want to get Biggs out of here, and he's welcome to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| But I also want to thank, there's a lot of elected officials that came out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| I, first of all, want to thank President Randy Boyd from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Randy, you're being recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| I also want to thank, recognize Tom Spangler, Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Thank you for joining us at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Super Bob Thomas from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| Thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Let's see, who else do I see in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| Nick McBride, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| My glasses are for only up-close stuff, so if I miss you, you're in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| I saw Virginia Babb earlier from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you for being here, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| If there's any other elected officials that I've failed to recognize, just wave me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| So, the next item on our agenda, we have a brief presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Mr. Chairman, sorry, just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| I just want to make sure, we voted on accepting the substitute motion instead of the original item 34 motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| But do we not now have to vote on, we just voted to accept the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| It replaced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| It replaced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| It replaced it automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| That was that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| That is the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| A substitute motion, when voted for and accepted, becomes the motion that we are voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| I just want to make sure we clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| If you wanted to amend the motion, you can do an amendment and vote to amend the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| and then you have to go back and vote on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| But that was a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| So, moving on, the next item on our agenda is a presentation from the Community Coalition on Human Trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| and it should be a brief presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Commissioner Anders, would you like to introduce us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| Natalie is our new, and I'm a new board member actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| but I've been involved in combating human trafficking for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| But Natalie is our new Executive Director of Community Coalition Against Human Trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| so I'll let Natalie kind of go through her spiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| We just wanted to take the opportunity to thank Knox County for their support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| and help in our work fighting human trafficking here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| We're the Community Coalition Against Human Trafficking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| We serve all of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| We have 33 counties in our service region, but we have a safe house here based in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| which is one of the only safe houses for victims of trafficking to receive emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| So Knox County is a safe home and a place of peace and stability for the folks that we serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| and we're only able to do that through the support of Knox County and our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| And we just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| and so we thought it was an opportunity to make sure that we are thanking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| and appreciating the support that we get here locally at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| and hope that we understand the support and stability that we provide to traffickers all throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Any additional insights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Were they building any new things going on with the program, any new facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| No, I mean, you know, the state provides three or four different providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| or support wraparound services, and they've done a really great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| And, of course, the safe house is a big step in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| So hopefully Knox County can continue to help them on the capital side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| We'll have transitional housing opening in 2020, which will open six more beds for survivors of trafficking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| to provide kind of that in-between support system for individuals who are leaving emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| but are looking towards stability and, you know, kind of independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| Yeah, that was kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| I knew there was a new facility kind of in the pipeline, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Madam Clerk, we're starting to miss a few people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| but we do need to move on the agenda before we have zoning at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| But, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| Let's go education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5163)|

| 1:26:06| I pulled two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| Get them to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Then I'll come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Let's go through the normal agenda, starting with educational consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| Do an educational consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| That'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5176)|

| 1:36:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| All right, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Jay, and I believe the second came from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| All right, so discussion-wise, the Chair recognizes Commissioner Anders' light first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| and then I recall from the work session, Commissioner Gill, you had a question that your light's not on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| but I remember you asking that question from the work session, so I'll get back to you if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| Go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| I'm totally in support of everything that they presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| It was well done, well documented, but I would like for us as a commission and the Mayor's Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| to consider funding, incrementally funding this over the next five to ten years in the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| because I think it's important and I think it makes our community better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| and so I hope that we don't just take this study and sit it on a shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you for those comments, and if I might weigh in on this one, I did a deep dive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| and I remember I was somewhat, I'll admit I was inspired by Commissioner Gill's question at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| Her question was fiscally kind of how do we work our way through this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| and one thing I might call my fellow commissioners' attention to, this is, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| when you sit down with this document, and for those of you who weren't at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| what we're referring to is a fairly large document that references all of the potential greenways for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:23| but there was one of the questions that were proposed in this document was really how do you prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| and how do you move forward, because each region of the county had multiple items that were suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:38| on how to create this connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| However, if you go to page 58 and look at chart 10-2, that, yes, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| Could you gavel to the audience, everyone to be quiet so we can hear, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| Yeah, Commissioner Daley has called for everyone in the audience, please be quiet so we can hear ourselves think on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| This is a very important item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| But the study, which we had a lot of folks put a lot of time and energy into this, it's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| I participated in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| My folks on North Shore went to some of the sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| But it was, when you first get this big document, it's a lot to swallow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| especially when you see the numbers and how do you figure out how we prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| So what I want to reference, and I'll do a very brief summary because I know we'll need to go into zoning at 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| but on page 58 in that deck on chart 10-2, the question the authors proposed was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:34| how do we move forward and start to prioritize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| And they also of consideration was, how are you fair when you look at the different regions in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| and how, when you start checking off these items, are you going to get your most bang for your buck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| where it creates a favorable outcome and starts to make some change in terms of connectivity and access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| Very briefly, you had three areas identified in the Beaver Creek West area for a total of roughly 4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5934)|
| 1:39:02| Beaver Creek East, you had three connections that were identified for roughly, I believe it was almost 6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| North Shore Drive, you had two big connectors that were identified for about 4.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| Governor John Sevier, you had two connectors identified that works out to, let's see here, about 1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:22| In Chapman Highway area, you had two connectors identified, and that was about 3.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| all told what, in my words, not the words from the study, about 20 million in low-hanging fruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:36| that was identified as priorities that would probably want to be addressed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| So my point is I wanted to bring that area to your attention, and back to what Commissioner Anders had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| this is something that you put in a five-year plan, a ten-year plan that we can start working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| Secondly, the funding is not just going to come from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| The TPO, this is something for that area to consider, which allocates federal monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| and some state monies that are passed through towards projects in the greater region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| You also have opportunities to apply for grants to help with some of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| And there could be grassroots efforts, community by community, to raise money to pay for some of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| But in order to be efficient and effective, the survey did anticipate our questions about where do you start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| and has identified by region the most low-hanging fruit in the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| So for the public, we'll need to make sure that this is available in a digital form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| to make sure that the public has access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| It's probably registered as our meeting, but I'll make sure that it's out there and easy to get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| through either scanning, now that the chair recognizes Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| And that was part of the conversation as we moved to fund these options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| a public process to have the information in a digital format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| as well as people within the community that may want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| But this plan also needs to be connected to our sector plans as they are updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| and making sure as we move through that process, we are looking at one of these factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| And I think that was also the other component that was missing from this process that we needed to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| Ms. Godleski, can I just ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| As you're coming down, I want to commend you and your team at Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| as well as with Engineering and Public Works and everybody that we worked with on the Gresham Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| for a great, real spectacular effort to put this project together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| How will you make this public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Because you did have a dedicated website to the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Is this final report going to end up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| That website is, I don't think, any online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| Ma'am, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| Shauna Godleski, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| So that website was just for the process of making this document happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| so it's no longer going to be in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| But as projects come up, we'll make determinations of projects that we can afford at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| and it will be a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| Well, I think to what Commissioner Jay is saying and what I just said, to be very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| and if anything, to give you specific direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| I think this body wants to make sure that this document, which is the plan, I know its size is awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| We want to see, and I'm speaking on behalf of my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| a digital version of this that is easily accessed by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| And I can't speak for the TPO usually puts these planning guides on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| I imagine they'll probably have a link for it on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| We have it cross-pollinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| You know, TPO is big and awkward, and it's a whole lot of moving parts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| This should be in the parks area, say, this is our aspirational goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Yeah, and it'll probably be on our website also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| Paul, where's the birthday boy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| I don't think they're here at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Anyhow, I was going to say this is something he should take some ownership on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| This item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| It's with a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Madam Clerk, what's the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| On page 7, item number 33, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| Tennessee, regarding the assurance of not to exceed $43 million general obligation refunding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| bonds of Knox County, Tennessee, Resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| Mr. Caldwell, could you please approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| We passed out a report for you, and we're going to do a refunding with your approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| of three bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| And I'm going to let Chris Bessler speak from Cumberland Securities, and he'll speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| you about what the savings are by the refunding, depending on the interest rate that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| and what those bonds are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| Chris Bessler with Cumberland Securities, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Thank you, all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| In front of you, I have a resolution approving the issuance of not to exceed $43 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| in a new refunding bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| This refunding will take out a refund debt that was previously issued by Knox County in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:29| There were two issues, one in June of 2010 and another one in December of 2010, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| additionally another bond issue in 2012, March of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| All three of those bond issues are now callable in the next few months, and we have submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| a request for a report on the plan of refunding to the state, and that is the additional exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| that Chris just handed out a few minutes ago that's in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| It is anticipated right now that, based upon current market conditions, that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| save in excess of $5 million gross on refunding these three prior bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| The Chair recognizes that two commissioners have questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| Frankly, Randy, I'm not sure which came in first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Randy, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Yes, was it Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Chris, you said this was three issues, two in 2010 and one in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| What were the terms of those bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| The length?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Both of the 2010 bonds were issued for a period of 25 years, so from 2010 to 2035.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:37| The 2012 bond issue was a 20-year amortization, so a little bit shorter, and that one matures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| in 2032.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| The refunding of all three of those will keep the amortization schedule the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:53| 15 and 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| I believe that was 15 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Oh, yes, 15 and 8, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| And what is the perceived rate that we're looking at that you base the cost savings off of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| The rate that you're expecting for what you've based the cost savings off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| Right now we're estimating the rate somewhere in the low 2% range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| How long were the, Chris, the last issues we made, what were the terms of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| The ones we just did, the 20s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Yes, I believe it was about 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| So roughly the same amount, and what we actually got on those were somewhere about 1.26, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| 1.31 or 1.33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| It was about 1.33, and the structure of it had a little bit more principal paid in the earlier years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| just due to what we took out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Gentlemen, I just was reviewing your document here, and by going through with this refinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| I just want to make sure I'm reading it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Less the cost of doing the refinance, you will save county taxpayers approximately $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| $3.9 million, and then you've got some closing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| The 3.9 is the net present value, and that is after costs are taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| Oh, that's already taken into account with costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| So by doing this refinance, you're going to save almost $4 million for the Knox County taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| And present value dollars, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| I just want to point that out, because a lot of times we talk about bond issues, we talk about finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| it makes a lot of people's eyes glaze over, but it's the hard work of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| and by managing the money well, you guys are saving taxpayers a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| and I really commend you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| I hope everybody supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| This comment is for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Thank you for providing the documents from the Comptroller of the Treasury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Why do you think the Comptroller's Office is creating a new division of local government finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| I don't know if I should answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| You know, I'll tell you this, and we can find, and I can get this to you, and this may be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| You're quick, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| So I am hosting an East Tennessee Finance Director's Roundtable on Thursday, and we'll answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:52| But Mark's got an answer for you, so there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| So historically the local finance was separate from state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| and then they thought they could save money by aggregating them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| but what they found is selling state debt was so different than basically keeping an eye on the local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| And so they realized they were not providing, and I'm saying this very respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| as good service to the local governments as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| And so they decided not only to create a new department of local finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| they brought back the General Secretary of the Board of Equalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| who had been the General Counsel to the Comptroller, back to run this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| She's super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| And they hired three new analysts to buttress their staff to six and assign them to different geographic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:37| And so it's a major reshuffling, and I think we're going to see a lot better service, a lot prompter service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:45| The people they have there are great right now, but it's going to really be great to have more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| But I talked a lot to Betsy, who's now in charge, and that's what she explained to me is the reason she did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| and she sees it as a really great opportunity to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| And she's going to be here this Thursday to speak to our finance directors in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| so we're excited that she's able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Good question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Are there any other questions or discussion items on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| It is bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you for the reminder, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| As this is a bond issuance, we do need to have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| So, Madam Clerk, would you please begin the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127businesspart1?start=6620)|
