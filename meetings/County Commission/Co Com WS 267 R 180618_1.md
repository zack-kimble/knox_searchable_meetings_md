| 1:46:46| that the Health Department can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| force a cleanup and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| we can charge back the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| private property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I shouldn't speak for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Health Department, Mr. Chairman. I could speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| to it from a zoning standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| We had talked about the possibility that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| if the closure does not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| forward, we'd want to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| So we would start by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| cleaning the area that's public right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| and then noticing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| owners that they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| needed to consider cleanup efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| but giving them an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| say a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| with which to complete those because it's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| big and substantial expense as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Commissioner Daly has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| referenced. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| for us as a governmental entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| we're prepared to take that on. But as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| private property owner, you start talking about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| cleanup cost that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| know may nudge up against 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| percent or more of the appraised value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| property. That puts people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| a difficult position, so we'd want to give them a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| of notice. How the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| would approach it, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I just don't have any insight there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| to share with you. I just want to be very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| that we don't move down a slippery slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| where people that have problems allow that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| to grow, thinking at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| the county's going to come through and rescue me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Yes, sir. And again, that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| we don't want to set the precedent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| any kind of cleanup effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| If we haven't created conditions where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| the problem can't reoccur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Would you like your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Well, prior to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| this is private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| property. This is what's getting me right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| now. You're talking about private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| and this dumping's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Have we ever cleaned it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| before? Yes, sir. There have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| some various cleanup efforts in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| I can't give you a whole lot of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| on those, but there have. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| should mention, Commissioner Bussard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| that the right-of-way also needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| to be cleaned. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| wouldn't want to leave this commission with the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| that the area of right-of-way is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| pristine and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| adjacent private properties need cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| because that's not the case. The whole thing needs cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| We just thought it best to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| this question before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| The right-of-way on that road is how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| Do you know? Is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| to the edge of the asphalt or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| is it... Do you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| 15, 20-foot buffer or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| You know, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Twin Creek is such an old road, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| if Jim's familiar with it, but I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| be surprised if it's just outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| the edge of pavement. Our standard right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| would probably not apply to a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| that's this old. It may very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| be edge of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| But if we go ahead and clean it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| up as Mr. Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| says and... Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| says and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| you leave the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| open, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| then it would become the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| Well, even now, it's probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| responsibility of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| in itself to have it cleaned up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| if people are illegally dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| on it. So it's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| responsibility to protect their own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| is what you're saying? Yes, sir. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| we just thought this was a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| approach to try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| the issues that are out there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| give the folks there that live some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| but have a permanent solution so that we're not simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| back every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| going through this exercise over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| But the problem if the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| department gets involved and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| call it a hazardous...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| They can also...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Is there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| What...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| what was it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| If it becomes a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| health issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| could declare it a public hazardous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| situation for the public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| they could order it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| If the property owner doesn't clean it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| then Knox County comes in and cleans it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| and that's a whole different financial process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| back on the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| But the same is true with codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| I mean there's a lot of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| to address this issue and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| Mr. Vandeveid is trying to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| with the least impact on these property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| And what I'm hearing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| the county will be generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| if we close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| If we don't close the road the county is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| mitigate what is our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| and look at getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| the rest of it cleaned up through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| some other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| I'm not going to put words in your mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| but that's kind of what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| That's absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| accurate Mr. Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| but can I say for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| this is important to me personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| it's important to the staff personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| this isn't a matter of us approaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| people with an ultimatum or anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| but we take very seriously every dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| that we spend is someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| else's money and it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| from every one of the nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| commission districts and we never forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| that and so when we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| at something in one district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| if it's a drainage problem in Commissioner Schoonmaker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| district and we think are we going to take public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| money to fix it? We always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| look at this through the lens of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| if I went to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| constituent in Commissioner Gill's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| or a constituent in Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Daly's district and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| we propose to do this on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| of your fellow constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| in West Knox County would they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| it a fair and reasonable thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| And so if we can get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| where we say yes we think a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| in East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| and a constituent in South Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| and a constituent in North Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| would think we're doing the right thing on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| of that citizen in West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| then we feel comfortable with where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| that is the lens with which we view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| this. If we're going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| this kind of money to abate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| this problem and I think that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| we only want to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| if we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| with reasonable certainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| that we can prevent the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| from occurring again because it is a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| fairly confident, in fact highly confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| we can say with a high level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| certainty that if we do go forward with the cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| go forward with the road closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| we think it's likely that the problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| 50 years of history is simply going to reoccur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| So that's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| framework, that's been the basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| through which we've approached this thing but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| Mr. Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| has said it very eloquently but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| don't want to approach it from the standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| of people feeling like we're giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| an ultimatum because that is not our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| at all. I mean these are our constituents as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| as anyone in this county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| we're just trying to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| with the best possible solution we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| with what feels like a series of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| pretty poor choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| So we have two choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| and one could affect the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| owner the other way we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| I mean about financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| because if we don't close the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| we clean it up and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| becomes an issue again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| it could become a health issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| and the property owner could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| impacted that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| If we close it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| and it stops the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| the property owner does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| have to face the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| I guess the health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| But what happens if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| do close the road and the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| persists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| some other place on that road which it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| could, what then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| do we do? That's a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| question Commissioner and what we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| is that people will utilize a convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| center that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| two, three miles away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| readily accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| We really think what we're fighting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| generational habit. It has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| been and Commissioner Daly can speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| this, he's a South Knoxby and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| but we see this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| and time again where people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| observed a practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| and I actually think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| Doug can speak to this too in park facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| where people have observed a practice for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| it's simply very hard to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| and this is our solution to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| Will we displace it? I suppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| it's a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| but the conditions at Twin Creek are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| pretty unique with the really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| steep two to one slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| The fact that it's dark and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| isolated and you do have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| to stop and just shove something out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| of the back of your truck and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| to the bottom of the ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| Those conditions don't exist in that many places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| so we would like to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| we wouldn't see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| displacement that you're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| Thank you sir for your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| Commissioner Wright. Thank you Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| This has turned out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| to be more of a thorny issue than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| uncovered, get it uncovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6940)|
| 1:55:48| in previous discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| I had really had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| real issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| in my mind about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| there are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| separate issues. One is access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| to a public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| is an issue of dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| having a problem connecting those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| two points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| but as we begin to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| further into what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| excuse me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| speaking of code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| now I do not want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| it's a health issue I just want to say it's a code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| problem and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| think of two separate issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| one on Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| and one on Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| where Knox County has become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| with code issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| and if the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| property owner has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| unable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| rectify a problem the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| has had to step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| and the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| owner has become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| That kind of breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| down to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| the question of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| do you connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| a trash problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| with a private property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| and access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| road in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| I believe the community has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| to face the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| that something has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| be done and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| the solid waste people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| administration is offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| that probably should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| accepted by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| community. That's not to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| which way I might ultimately vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| on closing the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| but I believe we shed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| a lot of light on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| this afternoon. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| clarify in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| and on what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| so if we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| closing the road and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| we end up closing the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| with the amount that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| Commissioner Daley gave us $115,997.57| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| what is the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| thinking they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| spend of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| I believe there was a fence out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| to begin with which I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| the county put that fence up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| several years ago when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| cleaned it up at one time. Is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| I remember the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| discussion Commissioner Carringer but the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| predates me and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| that's the case but I don't have any first hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| knowledge of it. And then according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| what I heard when I was out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| there looking at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| and all that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| storm came through or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| but a tree fell over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| on the fence and knocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| a lot of it down and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| the fence was never put back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| and then that's what started more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| and more of the trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| being dumped out. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| then we go back and we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| about the right of way and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| the payment on the street. So what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| I'm trying to clarify is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| we close the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| the county is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| spending what amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| Up to the $115,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| or so that was in the estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| That is even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| if we close the road we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| do all in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| $115,997.57| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| Even by closing the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| essentially committing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| to spend that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| Is that correct? No ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Legislatively I think these would be two separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| items. I think you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| vote the road closure up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| depending on where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| land on the issue. The cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| would be a separate scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| of work that we would bring to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| in a separate legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| action. But my point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| that what we want to do is leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| the property owners in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| the most whole and best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| condition that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| So if the point of closing the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| is to mitigate the problem with dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| it seems unfair to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| to simply close the road and then leave them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| with a mess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| bluntly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| most property owners aren't going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| $115,000 in funds available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| to clean up their property and remediate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| So if we are going to close the road in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| correct the dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| we would want to remediate that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| leave the property owners in the best possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| shape that we can and then hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| we have left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| everybody as well situated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| Well it already looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| from the pictures from when we were out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| with the road being closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| that a lot of the brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| and all that is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| into the road and all. And what I'm trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| out here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| we close it, we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| X amount of dollars or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| we leave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| road open and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| spend that X amount of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| it does go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| passage of a property owner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| responsibility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| if it's having to go out and clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| I mean in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| well yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| if it's clean will the fence go back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| I mean I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| if we go in there and if we close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| the road then we're going to go in there and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| up all the pavement or are we just going to let it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| grow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| or are we going to put a fence at the end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| I mean how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| We'd permanently barricade the road as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| whether or not we'd scarify the asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| we would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| want to talk to the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| if we close the road our standard practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| and close the right of way is simply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| deed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| area that's taken up by the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| to the adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| if the road has a separate property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| owner on both sides we split it down the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| and convey half of it to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| property owner and half to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| if the property owner owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| both sides then we simply convey all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| of the right of way to that property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| in the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| that the road stays open I cannot tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| particularly and Jim was telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| that the deeds vary but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| if right of way is inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| I don't know that I think a fence would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| a good idea it didn't really serve our interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| very well last time and I'm not sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| can put one up and stay outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| the mandated clear zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| it can become a safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| so I think we'd probably just clean to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| limits of the right of way and then try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| a better solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| But I think you said we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| no right of way just the edge of pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| Well you know as old as Twin Creek is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| I mean if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| before since this is actually just being moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| we'll get you the right of way limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| before next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| Monday as old as Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| is though it's hard to say some of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| deeds may call to the center of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| that's not unusual in Knox County we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| property deeds that call to the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| of the road we have property deeds that call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| to the edge of the road we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| you know the variation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| it's wide and inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| Yeah I know the city's more like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| center of the road over but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| I don't know it's still really hard to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| either way not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| what the cost is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| really if we close it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| what the cost is going to be down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| for the county if we leave it open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| what the cost is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| and I mean it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| really up to the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| to keep their property up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| it's hard to vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| when we don't really know what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| going to do about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| and how much money is going to be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| when on all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| Thank you I agree with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| Carringer it is the property owner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| responsibility to clean up the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| Dwight has come up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| great compromise so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| up to Dwight come back up if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| You have talked to Chief Harnish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| Could you elaborate on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| from fire and ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| what he told you and also about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| in case there's a fire I hate to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| this word because the worst thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| could happen is somebody go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| and start a fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| That property owner is going to be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| We did email Chief Harnish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| and I can provide that to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| as to whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| the closure would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| negative implications for Rural Metro's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| ability to deliver fire engines and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| ambulances to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| the houses on Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| He indicated it would not that the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| in question would not be the approach they'd use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| I assume that's due to the steepness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| of the grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| In fact he thought it mitigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| or might help abate the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| of a landfill fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| or a brush and trash fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| along the affected area of the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| Rural Metro didn't have any objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| to it and I think it'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| unfair for me to say that he endorsed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| I just think he said from a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| standpoint that they would not be negatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7537)|
| 2:05:45| Okay the motion before us is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7547)|

| 2:06:17| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| Hey Chris, is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| Transferring funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7581)|

| 2:06:25| to Shod Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7585)|

| 2:06:33| I'm asking him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| The budget in FY18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| if you look at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| of that note, we had to buy those radios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| We bought those radios early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| at a discount and so we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| take it from a capital account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| We took it from Shod Road so we put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| the budget we would just transfer that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| in fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7611)|

| 2:07:35| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| they were talking about the amount of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| that you would need to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| sports fields like softball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7661)|

| 2:07:47| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| We do have some property that's close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| in to town that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| repurposed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| what's on that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| be sent to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| and you'd have your 35 acres and part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| of that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7683)|

| 2:08:09| It's costing the county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| but we could move that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| to 3 ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| take that facility and put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7695)|

| 2:08:33| that kind of facility there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| put directional lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| also make green ways and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| to keep it as a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| and then like I said move that other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| where it could be maintained to a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| level the Par 3 course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| out to the 3 ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| that's about repurposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| that would bring in the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| capital and people in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| that would spend money, tax dollars here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| You're talking about 3 miles down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| to the 3 ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| for that Par 3 course and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| you have opened up a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| space and other things where you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| have a lot of field use in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| and I think that was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| things I think that we could look at to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| discuss to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| repurposing of land and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| need some time to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| all the land that we do own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| that the county has possession of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| where we might repurpose it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| to an income type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| property but this is just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| idea I'm just throwing an idea out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| there about looking to repurpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| a property like that to go along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| our sports program plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| and I just wanted to mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Thank you Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| and to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| along with what Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| was talking about, Par 3 Beverly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Hill, out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| Beverly, by Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| out on Tazeville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| is in my district and I have been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| our mayor, I mentioned this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| with our mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| there is some property up by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Three Ridges Golf Course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| on the other corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| processes that have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| take place before doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| some other steps to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| that particular property though on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Tazeville Pike in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| of it being more of a sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| the traffic is so bad on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| Tazeville Pike right now Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| and it is right at that curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| one of my main things was for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| maybe trying to relocate Par| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| 3 there is because of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| a little thin little wooden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| fence separates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| that Par 3 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| Tazeville Pike right there on the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| but I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| I am about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| moving that Par 3 if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| to be I think it ought to tie in with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| our Knox County Golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| Course and all but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| there are some more steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| through on with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| I just wanted to make that comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| that I am aware of all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| and maybe transferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| all that with our district and our mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| is definitely aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| Well yeah I think we have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| that in previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| years about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| moving that Par 3 up there it makes a whole lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| do we have enough land up there to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| Oh yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| I know it is on the other side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Maloneyville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| It is actually on the other side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Wise Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| Yeah the road that goes up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| Yeah I share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| I think it is a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| but do we have the money or the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| in this little block to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| put that Par 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| I think it is a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| to look at I don't know that you put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| I share Michelle's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| with the traffic there but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| I certainly think putting those two programs together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| is better for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| The reason why I was talking about moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| Oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| The reason why I was talking about moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| that sports park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| to the one out at Three Ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| and put it with another park I have been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| a number of times that that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| was given to Knox County and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| was to stay as a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| whatever we do with it if that is the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| we have got to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| where Beverly Park is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| if we move the golf course up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| we have got to put it into another park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| form and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| it could be moved farther enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| off the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| whatever we want to use it for that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| make the access to that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| a little bit better because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| there is 83 acres there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| and we are only talking about 30 something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| to use so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| make it into some sort of income and that is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| the only way I was mentioning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| I know it is in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| but we have other pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| all through the county that we might be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| things like that so anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| I know what you are saying about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| it supposed to be used as a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| but there has never been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| anything that anybody has been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| to find anywhere on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| that that has to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| there on Tassel Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| and there is some things going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| with one of the subdivisions and about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8026)|

| 2:15:10| junior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| pro golf tournament we have which is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| the tri-star| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| we will have the tri-star this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| we will have it next year and then we will have along with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| that will be almost two or three weeks in a row| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| and if you look through the booklet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| it tells how we can raise money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| sponsorship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| but the main sponsorship that is paying for the pros| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| to be here is already taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| given us a little bit of authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| we can go ahead and accept this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| type of program here because it is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| costing us any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| so anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| just take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| that is what is coming in next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| I want to thank Mark Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| the pro out at three ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| the mayor for his listening to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| strange ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| and hopefully this will continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| talk to the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| and see what we can do to maybe get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| from this tournament to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| and look at the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| bring some animals out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| I just thought you ought to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| what is coming out next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| Item 63| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| is discussion item to set the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| in September for the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| reorganization and swearing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| of elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| well we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| that during the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| but what I was thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| is we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| we explained that through the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| committee and get them to do their report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| part of the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| but they had a good discussion on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| we know that every two years we are going to have an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| that we are going to be sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| on the first and we take office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| on the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| and then when we have our pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| taken or whatever like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| whoever is reelected or elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| will have pictures taken sworn in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| and get all that going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| but see this year it felt kind of strangely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| it felt first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| was on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| of September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| so that kind of threw us off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| and there are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| offices that has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| but we can be sworn in but not take office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| anybody else from what I have discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| and what he said during that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| but we could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| calendars made up to give people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| plenty of time to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| because that time of the year is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| some of the times that a lot of us take a vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| so we could plan for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| and plan around those dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| to have those set in at the first part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| of the year of those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| that we are going to have an election and that is the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| that I was bringing up to discuss that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| let's have a year schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| school boards do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| we have a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| we meet certain days but there are other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| that comes up odd times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| every two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| so I just thought I would bring that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| to see what your thoughts were on this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| Commissioner David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| yeah just to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| on Commissioner Bussler's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| did make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| the commission only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| this is for commission only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| not swearing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| commission will reorganize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| September 1st or the next business day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| so September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| is on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| and we will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| this reorganization on the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| Monday unless it is Labor Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| and if it is Labor Day we will do it on the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| so that is coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| for the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| next month so just to give you a little information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| on that. That is only reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| only that is not the swearing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| ceremony I believe that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| set by the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| is that correct Mr. Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| yes but when you set a reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| date those officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| on commission have got to be sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| before you reorganize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| it will affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| the mayor's choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| of reorganization dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| under that scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| I mean it will affect it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| they will either have to swear you in on the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| or in front of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| of your reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| meeting if it happens to be the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| business day after the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| or they will have to have a swearing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| sometime prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| after the certification of the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| but before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| the reorganization that could even be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| that way you have the dates you can be sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| in and then say okay we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| you are already sworn in so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| you don't have to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| when you do your reorganization and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| make sure I mean you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| 17 days what is it 10 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| 17 days after 10 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| after the election I think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| commission certifies the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| but the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| question that will impact your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| choice of when you reorganize is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| when is the mayor going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| schedule the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| swearing in if you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| for example the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| that it will be the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| bit September the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| or the first business day after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| September the first if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| the first is on a holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| then that means the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| has got to schedule the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| swearing in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| of the first or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| morning of the first business day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| after the holiday so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| you all can be sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| to actually have a real meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| with the quorum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| or you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| be sworn in and have the ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| at some later date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| I was just going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| we are confusing two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| the reorganization you have to be sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| in yes but the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| swearing in ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| is purely ceremonial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| because everybody's already been sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| I hate to blow it for everybody on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| but everybody's already been sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| but I mean so that's just if you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| reorganize at nine you swear in at eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| if you haven't been sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| it's not that difficult we're making this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| we're making this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| bigger than it really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| it'll come before you next month and the rules change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| Do you want to set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| day and time now or wait till just next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| week that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| No but I mean you could say September the 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| at 4 o'clock or something because that's the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| it's June let's wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| till we get to July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| August maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| Did they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| they had announced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| August 31st was the official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| swearing in that is the ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| that is the ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| Michael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| Go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| Not quite as tall as the previous speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| Michael Grider 400 Main Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| Director of Communications for Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| So yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| so typically we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| do a ceremonial swearing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| ceremony for some officials it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| the official oath for some they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| swear in before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| but we try to do that as close to September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| 1st as possible this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| we had kind of started planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| in mid winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| early spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| toward a September 1 event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| some early feedback that we got from some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| commissioners and a football schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| indicated that maybe September 1st wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| the best day to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| as you may be aware UT plays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| on September 1st the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| opener for the season I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| so we started looking at August 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| I went to Law Director Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| and asked him is there an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| with swearing in early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| I believe your guidance was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| nothing wrong with swearing in early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| so long as officials know that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| don't officially take office until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| September 1 per the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| so all of those are things that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| kind of taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| an email did go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| last week or the week before last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| to everyone on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| ballot so if you're not on the ballot you likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| did not receive that email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| but everyone on the ballot did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| or should have received an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| for the general election saying hey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| if you are in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| elected during the general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| this is the proposed date or the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| date for the swearing in ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| incidentally August 31st 9am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8632)|

| 2:23:56| sir there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| one question kind of make this simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| we didn't bring it up in the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| this rule can we make this rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| go into effect for the 2020 election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| Mr. Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| I know if we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| next month and the month after it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| August so the rule would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| in effect in August or September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| so if we think if we next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| discuss it if we go it's 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| we'll be covered for whatever we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| to do this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| it would be effective immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| if you vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS267R180618?start=8668)|
