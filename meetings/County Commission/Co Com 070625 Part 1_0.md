| 0:03:31| Mr. Chairman, I just got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Kind of in light of what Commissioner Hammond was talking about, when this new policy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| was just explained to us, it might be a good idea if they don't already have it, when a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| new applicant comes, we hand them a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| I'm sure they'll get one from ABC, but they're not going to get that until all the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| goes to Nashville, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Or maybe it needs to be in our package we give out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| And we'll make sure that in the letter that I send, we include these applicants that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| coming before the board today on the list, so they'll get notified of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| It may be that we want to have a copy, we can have a copy of my letter along with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:17| With your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| With the application, so they can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=258)|

| 0:04:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| It seems like the earlier they get it, they could go ahead and get a jump start, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| on getting these people certified and trained and such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=270)|

| 0:14:35| and the heart that they have for our county and for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Father, I pray that today you'd give them wisdom beyond measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Your word says that if anyone lacks wisdom, let him ask of God who gives to all men liberally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Father, your word says blessed is the city whose builder is the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| Father, we thank you for our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=890)|

| 0:15:02| For when it prospers, then we too will prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| So I pray today, God, that you would give us spiritual eyes to see and spiritual ears to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| the things that you would have us to be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Father, I pray that you would tear down walls of division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Lord, that you would bring us together as one heart and one body, one city, Father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| one county that could glorify and lift up your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| Lord, I pray that today, above all things, that we would be men and women of holiness and purity and of integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| that we would be great servants of yours throughout all the days of our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| We give this meeting to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I ask, Father, that you would crown it with your presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| In Jesus' name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| If everyone will remain standing, Commissioner Tony Norman will lead us to the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=956)|
| 0:16:06| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Commissioner Strickland would like to have just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| I'd like to recognize a group of kids, the Youth Action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| Grant Rosenbaum and myself are advisors to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| These are some very, very sharp kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| These kids will probably be, one day, will be sitting where we're sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| And I'd like for them to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| And, Aaliyah, if you would like to say something briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Anyway, these, they, well, could you explain just a little bit about what they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:55| These are about half of your Youth Action Council members this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| And we have about 26 different high school students from 15 different high schools this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| representing students from all across the county, all walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Their purpose for existing is really to be a voice for youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| So, if you're looking for youth opinions or you'd like to have a youth opinion on different issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| or policies that might affect teenagers in the community, this would be the group to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| We're really proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| These are some of the best and brightest of our county, and they're ready to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| So, anytime you need teenagers or a teen opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1044)|

| 0:25:21| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1521)|

| 0:25:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| The man that's standing here before us, Mr. Barnes, I believe we can say as much as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| I can say a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| I just want to say that I have known a lot of men that lived in Knox County going on 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| But as a young man, my father was a police reporter for the Knoxville Journal for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| I remember when I was a little boy, one of the first people he introduced me to as a young man was Jack Barnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| And I remember how kind he was to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| And I don't believe I know anybody that I know of that knows or is friends with as many policemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| and as many firemen and as well thought of as Jack Barnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Jack, we are just so glad to have you as a constituent of the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| And we wish you the very best in your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Mr. Barnes, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| I talked to Jack just before I came in here, and Jack didn't want to be interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| So, please, don't interrupt him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Jack Barnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Well, all I really want to say is I do really appreciate the county recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| I worked for the city for over 27 years, and I guess they forgot me, but that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| I'm glad they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Because I'm well satisfied with my retiring and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| I worked under some real fine mayors, and I worked under one or two that wasn't all that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| But I will say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Most of them were sensible, but sometimes you run across people in this day and time who don't seem to know what school they're from, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:27| I think they need to get out and learn something themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| I mean, they may not learn enough from me, but I could teach them a few things, how to treat people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| And some of them still don't know how to treat people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| I don't have any money to speak of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| But I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I've got a lot more friends than maybe the local mayor's got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| You're talking about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| No, I'm not talking about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| I'm talking about the one that's going to give me all them respect and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| I don't want no respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| I've got all the respect I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| And the respect I get, I tell people like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| And that's a problem, I think, with him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| His father is one of the best men I ever met in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| I went to Washington with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| He treated me like a human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| And Jim, his daddy, is really a top-notch man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And while he hasn't learned him something, I also told his son they need to get inside and talk to him a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| because they need to learn him a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| But evidently they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| But I'll tell you, if he'll speak to 80% of city employees, they'd tell him that he don't know how to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| So I just want to get that off my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| I just want to let him know how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| I don't know where he got his word from, but his father told him when I had an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| that he could talk to me every once in a while, but he didn't seem to want to for about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| I know I'm mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| I've done everything, robbed banks and everything else, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| So I'm glad that they think that well of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| But I'll tell him one thing, and I want him to understand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| because I know some of his celebrities here are going to go tell him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I've still got a lot of friends, and I'll just put it straight, for a punk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| I've got more friends than anybody in Knox County because I treat people right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and they treat me right, and they know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1756)|

| 0:29:39| I mean, and I still like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1779)|

| 0:30:11| I want to kind of get that off my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1811)|

| 0:30:45| You can work things out if you'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| But if you don't try, it ain't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| I don't care if you graduated from Yale or Harvard or where you graduated from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| That ain't got nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| You got to have a little common sense, and a lot of people don't have that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| They forgot where they come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=1860)|

| 0:40:10| So Resolution 410 on Page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Mr. Chairman, I make a motion we approve all these except for 410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| We defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Second by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Chairman, I want to comment on this 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| I think, Mr. Moore, we asked last time whether they put a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| So whoever did that, we want to thank you for doing that so we can put these things together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| and know exactly what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| So I guess purchasing did that or administration did it or Mr. Moore, I don't know if you did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| but I appreciate having a map in there so we can see where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2444)|

| 0:43:21| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Let me indicate that several concerns I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| One is, first of all, this site was the one that basically was purchased in negotiation with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:42| in its property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| It was basically traded to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| This was the site that Mayor Ragsdale recommended that we build a main library on two or three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| That never came through, but we still haven't located a site for that or even indicated another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2635)|
| 0:44:05| But by this sale, we would forfeit that as a possible site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| But I would really like to talk about tax increment financing, or I'd indicate really tax financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| It is true there is no government bond-backed loan, but there is a government loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:26| And it's right there in the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| It's $8.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| And that loan is paid by tax dollars that is paid in by the City of Knoxville and Knox County for a duration of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| on this thing, of 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Now, it's true that if revenues come in a little faster, it could be paid off a shorter time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| but we're still talking about 17 years and a loan would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| While it's true that the developer would have to back it up, but the county would be in pretty sorry shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| if we didn't have the revenue for that to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Yes, it is a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| But what amounts to is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| And I know the City of Knoxville would be involved in this TIF program, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| But our revenues, by their own calculations, are $54,000 a year at the present tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| and value of what they think go on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| That is really not very much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| It's only, I don't know, 13%, 14% of the taxes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| All the money for education is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| All the money is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Indirectly, as we, because it does go on the tax rolls, people do pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| It's just where the money goes, is to pay off this TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| The State of Tennessee and the Better Educational Program takes into consideration your sales tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| and your property tax base for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| So I don't know what the effect is, but we know that we will lose some revenue because, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| as you add things to the tax roll, they give you less money back for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| So, indirectly, we lose money in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| Now, this creates some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| So it's not a net figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| The price of the land is under $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| On the State Street site that we bought, the county bought to build a justice center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| it's about three-and-a-half acres, and we put in $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| So, you know, if you look at the thing of what we have acquired in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| we basically have from three-and-a-half to $4 million an acre of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| It's cleared land, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Just like this is cleared land, that is cleared land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| So my view is that, first of all, that's sort of a low figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| Now, if you go back and look at when it was on the new Sentinel site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| the tax assessor puts value on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| They put land on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| This is basically land on the land, not the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| And the city acquired the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| So to say that we're getting back the money for that, that is a low price, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:25| And, second, the amount of revenue that we would get for the payment of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| We have about $60 million a year in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Less than half of that comes directly from the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| The other is by transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| And so it amounts to, by that method of the way we funded Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| we're giving up another $50,000 a year by just the method of funding our tax rates from debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:54| The city has 70-some cents in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| We have less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Now, other than this, it really makes no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| It's a transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| It all comes out in the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| But in this case, it does make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| Am I against this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| No, I'd love to see this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| But this is basically subsidized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| And I don't know what those condos will sell for, but if I take a hazard of guess, half a million, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| You could give me a correct number of what you think you can get for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| I just don't think people in the community who live in $100,000 homes or $200,000 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| whose taxes go in to the government and operate the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| I'm not sure that they appreciate subsidized expensive condos downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| And it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| It's for 17 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| We're really not going to receive much revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| Even though that length of time, that's a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| and the price of land ought to be two or three million in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| So it's a project I cannot support for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| It's not that we don't have good developers because they're good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| They're good developers for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| But I don't think this is an appropriate use of TIF program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| I really struggled with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| I'm generally, you know, very much in favor of TIFs when they're dilapidated old buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| And I really struggled with this one at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| So I studied the situation very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| And what I discovered was is that there's not a high-rise building in this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| or in any town nearby that I found that hasn't been built without some form of government subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| Now, I understand we're giving them a reasonable deal on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| although they're paying what it's assessed at on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| And we're also using a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| And a TIF is, for folks out in the audience who may not understand the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| it's basically a tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| What we're saying is that government is going to help you invest in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| by giving you a rebate on your taxes for the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| So if you look at it, if there's not a big building built on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| we're not going to get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| In fact, we may not even be able to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| That's a pretty nice piece of property, and it needs to have a big project on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| So I look at what's it cost in Knox County to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| It's really not costing us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| What we're getting in return for giving these folks a decent rate on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| I wouldn't call this bargain basement prices, but I would call it quite reasonable prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| We're certainly not gouging them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| What we get in return is we get a viable structure downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| that's going to have a huge economic impact on this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| We're going to have folks living in these condominiums on the upper floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| that are going to be spending their money in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| We're also going to bring new businesses to the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| Another thing that I looked at was the environmental impact of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Now, I'm not a tree hugger by nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| but it's certainly an added bonus if something's going to be done in an environmentally friendly way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| This is the first building that Knox County is going to have that's actually going to have green roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| Now, what I mean by green roofs is we're actually going to have things growing up in the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| on top of the roofs of these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| There's going to be terraces with gardens that are up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| These are typically the type of things you see in a Chicago, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| or some of these big major cities throughout the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| and we're going to have a building like that in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| I also spoke with Mr. Gibran about LEED standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| LEED standards are environmental standards, leadership and environmental design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| They're really going to be incorporating a lot of this new environmentally friendly technology into this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| so that this building is going to use a lot less energy than other buildings that are a lot smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| Now, this is a substantial investment that the county will be making in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| but look at what we're going to get in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| We're going to have folks living downtown, having an economic impact on their downtown area where it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| We're going to have new business downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Literally, this building is going to bring new life into this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| and when I look at what it cost us, well, we're going to give them a good deal on their taxes for the first few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| At the end of the 20-year period, and I actually think it will be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| I think this TIF will be paid off probably in about 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| At the end of that time, then Knox County and Knoxville City is going to get a windfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| when the full tax rate is assessed on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| I'm going to vote for this project, and I can't wait to see it finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| I think this is going to be one of the nicest buildings in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Okay, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| I appreciate the studied work of both Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| and especially Commissioner Frank Luthold for his numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| Both of you have contributed extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| I urge all of you to take a look at the most recent editions of Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| the Journal of the American Planning Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| I did, and it has good news and bad news for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| The good news is that this is not the most abusive kind of TIF that there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| There are some really bad TIFs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| In one case, there was a TIF actually where a trout stream was declared blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| so a Walmart could be put in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| There are abuses of TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| One of my favorite quotes from the article was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| tax increment financing subsidies are like development credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| Buy a project now and pay it off with future revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| But anyone who has a credit card knows the temptation to misuse it can be strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| We don't have to talk about misusing credit cards again, but we do have to talk about TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| This is not about big box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| This is not about low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| But this is also about precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Are we going to be establishing a precedent that everyone who wants to put up a nice condo downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| is going to request a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Are we going to give an unfair advantage to one particular group over its competitors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| Also, there's the question of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| If downtown is strong and developing, as we all have heard, why do we need this TIF to push it further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| In some ways, it sort of amounts to a reverse Robin Hood the way Commissioner Luthol was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| taking small amounts from the schools in the short term, and that's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| I also question the length and the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| In many communities, a TIF has to be done by either declaring an area blighted or with an only-if statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| That is, only if this TIF is granted is there any likelihood that a tax-generating property will go up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| And I'm not sure we can honestly make that statement, even if we're not required to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| I'm amazed to find that Kansas City recently elected a mayor on an anti-TIF platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| and he's imposed a moratorium on TIFs on his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| It's a tough call, and I can see people going one way or the other on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| But based on the length and the amount, I think it's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| I think it verges on something called corporate welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| So I hope balancing it, we will balance against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Commissioner Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| A couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| One, if you look around downtown, and I've been in this business a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| you cannot find a tower downtown anywhere that has not had a subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| We would have none of these big buildings downtown without some type of subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| Now, the subsidy the city chose in those days was to write a check, cash out of pocket, and pay for the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| They built the garage on every single tower downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| They built the garage at the Hyatt region, so they built the one at the Hilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| and I believe they built the one where the former Radisson is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| These buildings do not work without some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| The thing is what this group has asked is for us not to write a check, no cash out of pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| simply forego collecting our taxes for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| I think that happens to be well worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| And as far as the precedent, I don't know exactly what the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| My guess would be that a garage might cost about $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| I don't remember what the last one's cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I'm not exactly sure if you run the numbers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| The truth is this is not corporate welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| It's not a giveaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| It's part of a financing package that in today's economic structure simply has to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| It does not work without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| I, for one, am not willing to sit here and wait another five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| and hope somebody comes in and buys that site and puts a fully tax-generating property on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| I simply don't believe it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I simply don't believe it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| And if everybody with the Devon Group would stay seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| I'd like for everybody else to stand up that's willing to spend $58 million of their money in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| The sales tax on that alone will make up for all the losses we've talked about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| and that money goes directly to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| The 200 jobs that will be created, I think, is a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| The people that are going to live downtown, I am 100% in support of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| and I hope everybody will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| Well, I never have been one much for TIS, but looking this year, we're forgetting that this is not just condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| It's mixed office buildings, condos, and retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| Looking at the figures we have here, and I think we have to look a little bit further than this, Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| I mean Harmon, you know, we don't want to grant everybody TIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| but I'm hoping this will jumpstart Knoxville City to where these other things will come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| and generate business where we don't have to give them a TIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| But looking at the figures here, the day of the land sale, the taxes go to $8,570.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:54| After the project is completed, which is approximately three years, I believe, we're going to generate $54,856.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| After the TIS, and I do hate for it to go 20 years, but that's the only way the figures can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| we're going to get $447,156.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Now, that is not a lot of money compared to what our budget is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| but when you get to thinking what this might bring to downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| when these other businesses develop up here on Gay Street and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| we're going to create a larger tax base for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| and Lord knows we're going to need it with what all we've got on us with this pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| and the stormwater and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| I'm going to have to vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| and we're going to be looking at these other deals up here on Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| and we don't have to vote for them if they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| But this may be the jumpstart that Knoxville City needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| And we're all up here, and all of us represent the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| and we're not going to lose the revenue the county is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Now, I'm against going out here and building projects and granting TIFs and RFE, RFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| and all that, and RSFs on it, request for proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| and then the city coming out and annexing and taking our sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| But you've got to realize this isn't going to affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| As a matter of fact, this is going to give us 28 cents, I believe, out of every sales tax dollar to go to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| if I'm not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| So I think this would be good for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| I think it would be especially good for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| But I think it would also be good for Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| And I hope it creates something up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| I keep hearing about how hot it is uptown, the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| But I took a walk the other day up there, and I still see these buildings boarded up and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| Maybe there's something going on behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| But let's try to help the people of the city of Knoxville and Knox County both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| First, I want to start off by saying I have a great deal of respect for the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| for the architects and everybody involved with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| I have no doubt that they will build the best tower that's downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| But that's not my problem with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| My problem with the project has to do with the foregoing of over $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| maybe as much as $500,000 in property taxes for the next 17 to 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| depending on how quickly the project pays for the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| We're giving up the $1.23 in property tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| and we're only keeping the 33 cents that goes towards debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| We have 53,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| We're trying to provide them the best education system that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| while we're, at the same time, trying to keep the tax rate down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| And I understand that it will generate business downtown and generate some sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| but I just don't see where the net is because I still see people are going to be buying their groceries somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| They're going to be buying their clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| They're going to be buying whatever else they buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| They're going to buy it somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| And if it's bought inside Knox County, 72 cents still goes to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| And as much as I would like to see this go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| and I wish there was another way we could work this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| I just honestly can't vote for it because of the foregoing of all of how much money we would forego in the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:33| And, you know, every time you make a decision, there's opportunity costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| And I just think it's just a little bit too great on this one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| But if it does go forward, I certainly hope and wish them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| This is for Commissioner Frank Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Frank, I highly respect you and value your judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| You've got my curiosity here with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| I'm for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| I think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| But, Frank, have you got another way, another way of tweaking this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| or that we can do sort of what you're wanting to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| You know, I'm sort of like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| I don't like to see it take so many years for it to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| But I don't know if you have another idea, another way to skin this cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| I don't know there's another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I mean, they're the ones that made the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| It's not for me to suggest for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| I proposed some in committee the other day that basically the county give them the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| and give them some money and forego the lease the TIF for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| They still ask for the TIF for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| That didn't seem to ring any bells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| which means that this proposal is better than if we gave them the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| and gave them some money to boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| But they have to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| They made their proposal for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| So it's not really the commission's job to say you all do it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| They have their way of proposing and it's on the floor and people vote for it and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| But I just think that we can't continue to try to rebuild downtown by foregoing taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:20| because people have to pay taxes and they have to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| And what it amounts to, this gets to the place where we're adding money to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| I know they're taking a risk for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| All developers take risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| But this one here is saying government, if you allow the tax revenues to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| we can make this project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Now, that's going to help them or they're going to pass on the cost to those who buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| You know, they may lower the price of the condo some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| They may make more profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| I have no idea about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| And I'm not against individuals making profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| I'm for them making profit and making deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| But I don't think it's good government to give long terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| Now, if we're talking short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| we have done that in Knox County for some business to come in and create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| And we say we forego taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| We help them with the land at lower costs and they put it on the tax rolls, increasing employment directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| I'm for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| I've been for those for years where we make some investments where we get jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| We get them spending the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| I just think this is a big chunk to bite off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| It's not as small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| The numbers are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| I mean, it's not hidden about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| It's right out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| But there is a government loan that government pays back between the city and the county for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| And we're still, remember, we're still servicing those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| They still get county services and city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| Let me ask the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| Is this the average TIF length of year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| What did we do for the Tim Graham thing up there in South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| What's an average length on these TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| It depends upon the size of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Graham's TIF was less, but it was a much smaller project, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| So it just depends on what typically makes the numbers work and how large the project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| But I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| I think that this will be paid off much quicker than in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| Is there anybody from the Devon group that can speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| Can you all shorten that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| I'd like to hear a response from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| My name is John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| My address is 800 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| I am an attorney who represents the Devon group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| We have here with us the members of the Devon group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| Bob Talbot, who could, if you choose to ask them the questions, can give you the overview of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| Rajaj Jibran, who's here, who can speak to the construction aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| Jill Van Beek can speak to the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| I can speak to the TIF some, and I may give it a run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| Kelly Hedren, who works for Barbara McVurie, who can speak to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Joe Petri, you can speak to anybody's questions about marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| And then, of course, if anybody has any questions about the process the county followed, you have Matt Myers and Hugh Hull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| With regard to this TIF, the TIF is not a loan from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| What the developer is doing is he's spending all the money on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| Right now, this piece of property is on the county tax rolls at zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| It's generating zero amount of taxes for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| So if they don't do this project, you're not foregoing taxes over the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| You're getting none now, and you'll get none over the next four, five, or however many years that land stays there vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:56| They're paying $790-something thousand dollars, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| The figure is in the late $700,000, which is exactly what the county has had this property appraised for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:10| All that happens is, is after this $58 million structure is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| they are going to be able to recapture $8.2 million of the money they spent toward the infrastructure or the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:27| and other items, in-ground items, I suppose, mostly, to put this huge building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:35| It's not like you're giving this project $8.2 million and then they're paying you back with tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| That's not the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| The investors are putting the money up, and they're recapturing $8.2 million in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| You'll still get taxes on the building, which you're not getting now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| and they will increase as each phase is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| And when the TIF is over, it will balloon out to a rather substantial amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| What this brings to the downtown is it's going to float the value of the properties downtown upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:15| Everything that's downtown is going to benefit from this because the property will become more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| Now, I ask you, how many people, when they went through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| and I forgot, they advertised it in seven different publications, 14 different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| They had meetings and public meetings to see what the public wanted to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| And when all was said and done, there wasn't anybody with this group that was interested in pursuing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| How many projects do you think or how many people do you think are going to come to downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| and put up a 21-story building that meets the criteria of this one with the green roofs on top of the condos and this nice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4195)|
| 1:10:07| Sure, you might be able to sell the property to somebody in five years, ten years, or however many years out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| and you might be able to get more money for it, but they also might want to put a two-story parking garage on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| that has very little value or significance to the betterment of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:28| So this is a very good deal for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| These folks are not asking you for any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| The developers are putting up the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| And so it's a no-lose deal for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| Let me ask the mayor a question back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Mayor, is this the longest tip in your history that you know that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and is this the largest project that we've done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4254)|
| 1:11:05| This is the longest one we've done in this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| The legislation will let you go 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Obviously, they haven't asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| This is for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| And, again, Commissioner, I think you'll be paid off for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| Mr. Baggins is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Right now it's just sitting dusty and we're not collecting a single penny off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| But is this the biggest project that Knox County has gone on a tip on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| In my tenure, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Well, that makes me feel better to know that we're getting that bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| As I was doing my research on this, one question came to mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| and that was when was the last time we saw a facility like this built in the downtown area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| Not renovated, but built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| So I contacted Central Business Improvement District and they gave me the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| And the answer was Century Square, which is where the statue, I guess, of the rowboat is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| And they said that was in the early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| So we have an opportunity to do something here that hadn't been done in 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| and that is see a structure actually built in that area of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| I think that this is something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| We do not need to wait another five, maybe ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| We have an opportunity now to do something we haven't done in about 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| How do you put a price on the vibrancy of a downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| I don't know how you look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| But I do know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| It wasn't but just a few years ago that you could come downtown and you could shoot a cannon down the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| And you could go to Market Square and there wasn't anyone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| No one wanted to come downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Now they tell me that approximately 2,000 people make their homes in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| I can tell you if I were 30 years younger, I probably would buy one of those lofts and move downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| because I just like the idea of being in a downtown type of environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| You look at Market Square and the renovations that have gone on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| You look at the Tennessee Theater renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| You just look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Regal is going to open up a movie theater here in just a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| This adds to the vibrancy of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| And when we look at this project and we look at what it's going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| yes, it's going to provide employment for hundreds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| It's going to provide sales tax and materials being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| But as people buy these condos and as they come in and as they get these offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| and as they move into these offices, they're going to be buying things for those offices and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| But that adds to the vibrancy of a downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| The more vibrant your downtown, the more money you get in taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| the more businesses are going to want to locate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And to me, this just makes good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| So I will be voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| You know, I would just like to say this and then I'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| You know, we've done a lot of things here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| and probably wasted the taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| But, you know, some things you have to look at that we do are a great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| And we went down here and went in partnership with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| and built a road down through Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| We put money up and paid for that right out of our bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| And I think it's paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| I don't believe anybody can argue that it hadn't paid off tremendously for everybody in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| and Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| And I just think this is a good deal overall for the city of Knoxville especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| but also Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| And like I say, we represent citizens in the city and the county both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| And I think we need to try to do everything we can to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| I know the city needs the revenue and I certainly know Knox County needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| And sometimes, fellas, you just have to as a businessman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| you just have to roll the dice and hope these deals work out like they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| And I think this is one that will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| I think the odds are in our favor of it working out in helping promote all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| We've got a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| Do we want them to finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| You allow me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| John Banyan or whoever would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| This is an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| I was just meandering back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| I didn't know this was like school I called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| Well, I'm not going to wrap you on my fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| The garage, will it be open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| or will it be just to the folks that have business down in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| It will be probably open to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| At least originally I would suspect it would be open to the people who are in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| the tenants and the people who are renting units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| So it won't be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| So if someone is trying to find somewhere to park to go to the theater or shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| they won't be able to park there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| Well, there would be a limited amount of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| I guess the way these things work, Commissioner, just like in Plaza Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| they give each tenant so many parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| And usually the tenants want more than they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| And then what's available after the tenants have leased their space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| and the retail people have leased their space, then there would be a limited amount of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| Whatever is left would be subject to being rented by the members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| It would be just like the rest of the garages that are under these towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| Let me try to look at this one more way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| Let's say we're going to start a business and we put up our personal money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| and we go to the bank and we're a little bit short on how much we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| Well, you can go to the Small Business Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| You can go to THDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| You could locate an empowerment zone and get help that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| You could go to a venture capital group and get help that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| You could go to a revolving loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| A TIF is nothing more than a part of an overall financing package on a project this big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| And it's a needed part of the financial package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| And it's something, it's one of the few things that will make something like this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| The other, there were some comments about sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| I agree that the people that work here would spend sales tax anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| but the million dollars in sales tax that will be generated off the building material we would not get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| So that's certainly a net positive for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| We don't know what the people that work here would spend sales tax anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| because we don't know what's going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| There may be things going in there that they can't buy on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| So, you know, we'll get it if this building is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| I'm talking about the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Another thing, adding the number of jobs that this is going to add to this community is going to raise the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| So there's going to be a significant increase in sales tax when you've got this many high-level jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| It's going to raise the wage level throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| We've had a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| Mr. Valiant, to clarify one thing, did you all agree to take Exhibit A out or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| I thought you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Exhibit A was covenants for special warranty deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| And what it does is it gives the grantee, it gives the Devin Group an additional 24 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:40| from the date of closing on the property to commence construction and to meet other deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| But if they fail to do that, then Knox County would, could pay back the $796,000 and receive the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:59| And the way I understand it, and certainly it's better for the county from a legal perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| because we may end up with some liens on the property that we are unaware of at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:14| But we would be better off without providing a special warranty deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| and, in fact, providing a quick claim deed as we do all other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| From what I understand, Mr. Valiant has confirmed they've agreed to strike Exhibit A from the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Is that fine, Mr. Valiant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| We'll try it with voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| Commissioner Harmon, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| Is there any other noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:06| Fifteen ayes, three noes, and one absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| I really think this is going to be good for downtown and for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Just to clarify, it's been approved with the change of taking Exhibit A out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| We're on 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| This is a consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| requiring Knox County to accurately report Knox County employees' social security earnings records according to law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Intergovernmental voted 6-1 and two absents to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| Finance Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| Finance Committee voted 10-0 to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Make a motion we defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Seconded by Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| I introduced the original motion, and I think it's stronger and better if we act now rather than wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| I hate to think that we were going to end up in a situation of government by being sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| So if the majority is willing to take that risk, fine, but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| We've got a motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| We have Barbara Cook here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| She wanted to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| Do you wish to speak or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4898)|
| 1:22:05| My name is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| I live at 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| I believe that each of you commissioners received a communication from me prior to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| and I appreciate the consideration that you're giving by deferring this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| There are some questions, however, that I think should be answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| and I don't think that the law director would object to finding out what the plans are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:44| for the implementation of this FICA withholding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| When is it going to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Is it going to include all of the wages for 2007?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| And how that information is going to be communicated to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| because if the plans that I have heard rumored are to implement this in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:14| it will be very difficult to determine whether with the pay raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| and other changes to salaries, whether this indeed has been effectuated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| So if at least you could ask the question, is it going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| When is it going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Is 2007 going to be included for the entire year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| And how will the employees be notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| That much I would like to believe you could maybe not defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Commissioner Farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| I had checked with a person who I think should know, and the answer I got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5037)|
| 1:24:07| because this was about the whole issue that you have brought up, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| And it is correct that this has been a reduction in salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| and with that reduction in salary, Social Security has been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| and paid to Social Security for those individuals on that part, other part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| It was my understanding that starting July 1, from then on, they may be taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| And to hear that this is the plan to start, this is really what it amounts to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| is governments across the United States have had the opportunity or right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| or allowance to, in fact, have a salary reduction for that part that they take out for a pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:56| and would not be counted in Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| But you're not paying in Social Security, and you're not using it to draw out Social Security, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:06| Individuals can be on both sides of that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| because what it amounts to is that if we start taking out on that six percent that's taken out of their pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| they're paying Social Security part to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Of course, that goes into the Social Security and adds to their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| But in terms of rectoactive, I don't think there can be anything rectoactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| It's just a matter of are governments anymore across the United States under the tax codes in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:35| and that's what we're talking about is national law here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| of the recommendation is that we should start doing this practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| And I don't think it's been clearly settled in all the courts to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| but that's been the recommendation of the attorneys that deal with the pension board that that practice start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5151)|
| 1:26:00| And, of course, that would change things, as you well pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| because it changes what has been in there, the accumulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| but also changes in terms of how much money you're going to be taking out of your salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| because you're not going to be paying Social Security on your part that goes to pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| which I think the rest of the world has already been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| It's just that governments have been allowed that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Somebody wants to add to that, but that's what I had heard, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| I think there's a lot of speculation and a lot of people have heard a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| That's why I think it's very important to get it clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| I really believe that one should not have to depend upon the courts to decide whether the law is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:52| And while this hasn't been tried in the 6th District, it certainly has been tried in other courts in this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5212)|
| 1:27:00| this particular issue, and it has been determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| And I really would not like to see us have to go through a process where the employees have to take it upon themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:14| to appeal to the IRS to get this taken care of, because that wouldn't be pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| either in the press or in reality, because there could be a lot of fines and penalties associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:29| You all know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| I come to you truthfully to try to let you get out in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| It's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Thank you, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Okay, Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| Mayor, Ms. Cook had asked, you know, how would this be communicated to the employees of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:56| I assume you'll put out a memo and have that distributed throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| Could you tell us the process of how this would be implemented if it had to be implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| In the way that we normally communicate with our employees through e-mail, faxes, our employee newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| it will be in all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Mr. Chor, you may want to comment on where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| We have worked with Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I know that we've had conflicting legal opinions on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| and Human Resources has put together some proposed wording, and I think that would be very helpful to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:34| I also think, you know, how quickly could this be, how quickly is this going to be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| and how quickly will we be able to get the word out to the employees that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| your check is going to be less this time around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| We'll have a recommendation for you in 30 days where we want to go, what we think you should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| We'll work with the law department, as we always do, to try and get that determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| And one other way we always communicate with the employees is through their pay, as you're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| through the pay stubs, through the paychecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Most everybody looks at those pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| I just want to make sure that, you know, we don't want any surprises on our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| All in favor to defer 30 days say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| Alert 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| This is a resolution requiring all real property owned by Knox County to be sold at public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Intergovernmental voted no recommendation on a five, two and two absent vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Finance committee approved 10-0 with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Do you know what the amendment was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| I think it was changing it to an ordinance, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| The reason that I put this in here for commission, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| is the fact that these RFPs that we're getting, you know, this last one we just voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| was sprung on us all at once here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| We didn't know anything about it until just here a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| And we've either got to have some kind of checks and balance on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| where we're informed where we can do a study on it to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| You know, I'd like to know when they put the bids out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| I think we should be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| I think we should be notified how many people see the bids ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| since we're the ones that have to vote on it and we're responsible for the tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| So that's why I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Yeah, I want to do the same thing as I mentioned earlier before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| I want to know what's going on in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| You know, if there's something being sold in my district, you know, I want to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| And, you know, I don't care about everybody else's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| but I think we need to know everything, like Mr. Pinkston's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| especially in our individual districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| I think we need to be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| Commissioner Cate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I'm just wondering if, and maybe this is a question, I don't know if Hugh Holt's still here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| if we ought to leave ourselves some latitude here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| if we ought to either make a decision whether to send out an RFP or do public option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| I'm not sure we want to say everything for sure will be sold by public option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| Maybe we want to have that option and maybe we want to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| That's my only thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| I can go along with that if you can amend it some way to where we have some say so on what the RFP is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| We know who turns these in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| But, you know, I went back through the school since 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| We've auctioned off all school property with the exception of Brownlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| Brownlow, we sent out an RFP on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| There was a 36-month occupancy in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| They didn't abide to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| They turned around and sold this building for $125,000 profit, and nothing has been done to it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| So it looks like with an RFP that we don't even have any control over it like we would on deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| So that's my thinking on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| We've got to do something to protect the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| Now, if the purchasing department wants to come up with something on these RFPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| to where we're notified maybe 30 days before they even put it out and what the stipulations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| show us how they're advertising it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| When you're auctioning off a piece of property or putting an RFP on a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| like when you sent them up there for $800,000, we need to run something besides a $49 or $50 ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:41| There needs to be several ads in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| They need to be a substantial size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| And if they don't have the money to do it in the purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| we need to furnish some of the money on that particular event somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| But I'd be willing to go along with some RFPs if we've got some kind of control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| I don't disagree with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Do we want to send it to purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Wait, if I may suggest something, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:09| I think they've put it in a, John Owens has put it down to an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:16| It's on page 104 on page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| So if you would like maybe recommend withdrawing 908,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| and then we'll take it up at 104 in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| And I think it addresses that issue you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| I'll make a motion to withdraw 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Commissioner Cate, catch your light on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| All in favor to withdraw this say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| We're on 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| This is a resolution instructing the Knox County Auditor to release reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| to all Knox County Commissioners when they are ready for release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| I'll make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Second by Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| If I might speak to this since this was why I put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| A few years ago I was part of an efficiency panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| which was appointed by this body to look at efficiencies in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| And one of my roles in that was to look at the Office of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| And as I looked around at other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| and other governmental entities that had a Department of Internal Audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| it seemed like a good thing for Knox County to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| And I believe that that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| I believe we've got a good person who really is passionate about his job in that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| and Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| And one of the things about this office is it must be independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| and it must operate with integrity if it is to work at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| And I believe Mr. Walls has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| He does a lot that a lot of people are not even aware of in terms of things that he does for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| So, number one, I want to commend Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| The reason I put this on is I was watching TV the other night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| and I saw where a report had been released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| and it was intended for the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| And in order for me to get a copy, I had to go to an Internet website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| and download it from a totally different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| and quite frankly that upset me that a report intended for this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| I had to download from an Internet website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| So what this resolution does, frankly, is it asks our auditor to release to all of us as county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:37| any reports that are intended for us to be released at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| In other words, if he's going to release that report to anyone, if it's intended for this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| that we all get it at the same time and we don't have to download it from an Internet site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| The second thing is that Mr. Walls in his memo to us earlier is suggesting that as a part of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5752)|
| 1:36:00| that we ask Knox County employees to work with him in a timely and expeditiously manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:08| I guess to work with you directly and expeditiously are the words that he's using in his memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| And so I would like to include that as part of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| is to ask the county employees that if, indeed, he does ask them for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| that they be required to work with him to get that information to him directly and expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:28| Is that your wording there, Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| So you have asked that I include that, and I'm pleased to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| So with that, I will ask that you vote in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| Does the second accept the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| That was from Mr. Huddleston instead of Pinkerton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| I just wonder if that wording that you're talking about is a little bit too nebulous to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:58| These are the words that Mr. Walls had suggested we put in, so I was following his lead on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| Mr. Law Director, can you come up with any other words that if Mr. Walls goes into any department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:11| that he gets full access without being hindered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:19| Expeditiously and what was the other word, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| Expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| He suggested that the wording be that we require Knox County employees to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| and provide information requested directly and expeditiously to the Knox County auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| You could put, you know, a time frame in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| I mean, it does require some urgency with the word expeditiously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| but you could put in by no later than five days from the day of the request, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:51| there to make a communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| But what, you know, it depends on the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| It depends on the nature of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| It depends on how involved it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| The county employees that may be providing the information may be busy with a number of other matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:13| We can put in any timeline that this commission, this body would like to place in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| Require immediate attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| I'm just concerned that this wording, we could not enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| Well, I mean, there's, what could you do to enforce even a five-day requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:39| This body could bring it, it could come back to the attention of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| that a certain official hasn't complied with a resolution of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:50| But ultimately, I think you have to just rely on the cooperation of the officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| And if they don't provide the information expeditiously, then bring it back up before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5936)|
| 1:39:04| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| There's some information that we can get to Mr. Walls in a matter of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| Other times, as Mr. Owings mentioned, we're doing other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| and it just won't be able to respond that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| But my suggestion would be that Richard make his request and I can give him a time frame that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| And if he doesn't think that's reasonable, then we'll communicate it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| But I think in every case that we're going to be able to oblige.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| He's dealt with us long enough to know that if he tells us he needs something by a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| we'll tell him we can either do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Most of the time we do, if there's an extenuating circumstance, we'll let him know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| So we want to be fully cooperative in this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| However, I think you do have to realize some things take longer than others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| and to try and just put a time line on everything that encompasses every request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| might not be the most practical thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| But we're going to work with Richard to give him everything he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| But I think the question is if Mr. Walls needs access to something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| a human resource or a finance department, I think in the past we have to go through you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| He's never gone through me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| He's gone directly to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Mr. Walls, I mean, the last thing that we asked for, did it not have to go to Dwight or something first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| or did you get it directly from the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| The credit card information and the reimbursements and payroll came through Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| All you have to do is call me any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| I've never gotten a communique from you that we haven't immediately jumped on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| So I'm here and those people work for me and I'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| Just send it straight to me and I'll be glad to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| All right. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| I'm not saying you, you know, I think you'll do what you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| but I think the auditor ought to be independent and have some kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| if he goes to finance and needs something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| that they ought to be able to give it to him as quickly as possible without going through somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| In any office, he ought to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| If he needs to go into the sheriff's office or if he needs to go into the registrar's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| or he needs to go into the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| he ought to have full authority to do that without being hindered by an office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| And he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| I will not hinder him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| But on the other hand, before I went down to county commission and asked for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| I would come to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| They basically work for the chairman, those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| All I'm asking is the courtesy of letting me know and not to hinder it but to expedite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| And we'll give him a time frame and if he doesn't think that's reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| we'll work with him to shorten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| And I think we want to work with him any way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Okay. Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| It seems like we may have had a problem getting some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Am I right, Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| We've had some problems getting information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| Well, on the latest request, we got it after you guys addressed it last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| And, Mr. Mayor, do you still have a parallel investigation going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| And that may be some of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| We've got two different people trying to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| What I would suggest is let the internal auditor do his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| and let your parallel investigation kind of cease and desist right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| That's an internal investigation that you're running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| but this is the one that commission has asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| And they may be trying to look at the same stuff at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| and that would be probably tough for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| So maybe we should give Mr. Walls, afford him some manner in which he can get it a little faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:28| Okay. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| The mayor basically covered my questions, which were addressed to Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| and so now do you feel that satisfactory in terms of the kinds of information that you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| Is it timely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Is it expeditious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| Is it going to be expeditious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| Are you satisfied now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| I think most of you all know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| I can work with just about anybody on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| And I believe directly and expeditiously will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| And, you know, if I have problems, I'll bring it to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| Just to clarify the resolution, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| We're not just after, you're not just wanting to go after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| It's any office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| No, it's any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Any report, whether it's, regardless of who it is, any report that is ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| whether it's a draft report or anything that's going to be released to anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| and it's intended for this commission, be released to all commissioners at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| Because we, again, I don't want to have to go to an Internet website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| and download a report that was issued for this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| I just feel that that's the right, that's a good way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| It's going to be hard to get it to all commissioners at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| Some of us may be out of town or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| As long as it's made available, it can be faxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| They can get a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| I would say it just needs to go to the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| and for them to fax you and tell you that it's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| and if you want to pick it up, okay, and if you don't, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| Whatever means would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| So it is made available to everybody at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Everybody should just be notified of it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| And it passes unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:34| I think we're on ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| First reading, 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| making it unlawful for a non-Knox County resident to utilize Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| convenience centers for the purpose of disposing of solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| This is ordinance 101 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6293)|

| 1:46:27| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| For those of you who missed the intergovernmental meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| the law director and I had a very interesting discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| and I just want to make sure that the points raised there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| that I have them correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| is that this involves the fact that our charter and our ordinances set up at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| the fee offices, sheriff, trustee, et cetera, register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| had a little noticed limit of either you get a county vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| or $300 a month for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| It's not just the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| It is any county official may either be assigned a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| or they may receive a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| And that routinely that was not observed and that many times these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| persons or these offices went by some amount in their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| and were significantly over the $300 amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| No, I would not say that it was routine, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| Did it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| As far as I know, yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| And I just wanted to put out sort of a general public irony alert here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| After all of the grief we gave the mayor properly over travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| we are now looking back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| and discovered that we screwed up in a whole bunch of areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| and that we're not only going to correct it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| but we're going to backdate it to September 10th, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| We're going to sort of backdate this policy that we're going to do it by the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| rather than by this $300 or vehicle rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| Is that the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| Not pro-tunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| It goes back to the date of beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Which would be September 10th, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| September 10th, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| Quite frankly, we're not sure which official may have budgeted more in their account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:22| than the code section allows and back to what date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:29| What I do know is that the budgets are approved by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| and have been for the last 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| And salary suits for which the fee offices are subject to for their salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| are approved by both the used to be the county executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| Now it's the county mayor and they are approved by a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| I don't see a problem with changing the rules, but I do have a problem with the backdating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| It seems like we could be covering a large overage with not even knowing that in our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| So for that reason, I'm going to oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6552)|

| 1:49:24| amending Knox County procurement codes, section 2-712,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| as previously adopted by ordinance 0-05-4-101 on May 23rd, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| This is ordinance on first reading 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Seconded by Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| What does this do for situations where we want to have request RFPs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6590)|
| 1:50:00| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| I'm on the wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| I think I'm on the wrong ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| Mr. Owens, do you want to explain what it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Ordinance number 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| You will look in your book what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| We've italicized the change to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| We set out section 3 of the ordinance that is codified as section 2-712 of the Knox County Code, section B3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:41| And what I've done in the first instance, I have italicized the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| and then following our enactment language, I have set out the ordinance as it will read if it is approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:57| Basically, what it does is it changes the ordinance to allow for the commission to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| The commission actually must approve the method of disposition prior to the sale of real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:12| So it accomplishes, I believe, what Commissioner Pinkston had requested through the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| Let me just make a, I think in the caption it says consideration of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| I think it needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| It should read ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Commissioner Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| I think part of Paul's question was that we received notice at the time the bid process goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:42| Would that be accomplished by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Yes, it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| Do you want to speak to it, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Go ahead, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| I was just thinking Commissioner Pinkston wanted, the way I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| he wanted the commission to make the decision if we send out RFP or if we sell it at a public sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| or a sealed bid sale, whatever decision is made, it comes from this commission first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| So now, Mr. Mayor, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Just a couple of points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Let's use the Sentinel site for an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| We sent each of you the notice of public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| We sent each of you the notice of the meeting with the developers to talk about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| Along the way, there have been at least probably three or four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| You've gotten that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| We've thought, well, maybe we've messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| We went back and looked and, no, you did get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| And, ultimately, the decision on how we dispose of anything is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| All we can do is simply make a recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| But if we haven't communicated as thoroughly as we should have, we'll do a better job going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| because we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| And I view this as a partnership, not an isolation thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| And I think I appreciate the way you approved the Sentinel site today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| And those of you who voted no, I thought that your arguments were very substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| And I'm grateful for those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| But we'll work with you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| And we went back and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| And if we need to send something out in some bolder letters or bolder type or whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Commissioner Pinkston, I don't know if, you know, this is what we just did with the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| That's a lot of high profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Can you maybe add an amendment on there that we'd be notified with maps and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| so we know what we're looking at and stuff that's in our district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| Or is that going to come natural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| Commissioner Smith, I think the ordinance is that you're going to see it before they even start doing anything with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| because we're going to approve either we're going to sell it, we're not going to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| or we're going to tell them to send out an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| But we'll be notified in our districts as to what's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| We'll be voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| It will be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| And it passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| amending Section 2-478A of the Knox County Code, Ordinance 0-03-4-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6837)|

| 1:54:09| This is on First Reading 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| And this one, too, I think the caption should read ordinance instead of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| And that's because we had it originally set up as a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| but it's more properly an ordinance because what we're doing is we're changing our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6866)|

| 1:54:30| Second by Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to recuse myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6880)|

| 1:55:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6915)|

| 1:55:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6922)|

| 1:55:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| I think that concludes everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Mr. Mayor, I've got one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| You sent out a letter earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| In that letter, you've asked to start a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:15| And you've got Mr. Walz on your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| I think maybe it might be an appropriate thing to have Mr. Walz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:27| finish his audit without being hindered with a committee overseeing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| If that's whatever you'd like to do is okay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| We were just trying to be inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| It might be up to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I mean, if you all have any ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| I mean, I think Mr. Walz needs to have the independence to conduct this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| audit throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Whoever you would like to replace with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Well, I mean, does the mayor, I mean, could Mr. Walz just not do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| and you just not have a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| We're going to have a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| We're going to get this purchasing thing straightened out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| and I'm going to take the lead in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| I'm not happy about what's going on in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| I've made no secret about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| But I can tell you going forward, it's going to be fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| and we're going to have some outside eyes to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| So Mr. Walz is more than welcome to be a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| but we're going to go forward and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| The draft that I got from Mr. Walz today, he's got a lot more work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| and he has recommendations in here that I think we need to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| And I say we need to hold up on any committees, let Mr. Walz get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| and then when we get done and get all the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| let's get together to see how we can keep this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| But right now, I think we just need to go one step at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| and everybody just slow down and take it easy and let him get his work done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| and then we can put steps in place to ensure that this kind of stuff doesn't happen anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| And I don't think it would serve any purpose right now having a committee to look at what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7075)|
| 1:58:03| Let's let him finish his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| He's good at what he does and report to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| We'll get together with the mayor, and, Mayor, you and this body right here can sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| and come together and make some necessary adjustments that need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:21| I believe we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| Mr. Walz, addressing Commissioner Trammell's suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| what amount of time do you see is necessary for you to do your job here on the PCART?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:41| The first step was issuing the draft today on the allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| And so now we're going to wait for a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| And, you know, if there's items in that that need to be corrected, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| So I gave everybody a week, or basically end of the week, to look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| and let us know, you know, what their responses are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| and if there's any changes or any additions, you know, that need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| And the next step, I'll be better able probably after tomorrow or Wednesday or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| to let you know, you know, what we do have and what we're lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| And, you know, I would hope within a month, possibly roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| that we could, you know, have our work done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| and have a draft out for review at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| But probably by, say, Wednesday or by the end of the week, we'll have a much better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| And so we'll be getting, the commission will be getting a report via fax, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| when you're finished with your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| Mike, is it, Mayor, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| would it be satisfactory for you to compose this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| without Mr. Walls with the remaining people on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| Maybe I'm wrong, but Commissioner Trammell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| didn't you mention earlier there about this investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| and how it would interfere with maybe things that Richard Walls was needing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| our auditor, how it would be a conflict, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| that he couldn't get the information because this committee is looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| It seems so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| It seems so, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| I mean, we've got two investigations paralleling each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| We need to let Mr. Walls do what he's paid to do first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| and then we can bring out anybody from the outside that wants to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| and see what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| I mean, you know, let's be very transparent and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| But, first of all, let's let the investigation run its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| You know, when you start doing these side things, it can distract from what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| and we need to stay focused on the task at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| and that is letting Mr. Walls do his job, which he's very capable of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| Well, I'm going to have to agree with you on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| because I think we ran into a problem, Mr. Walls did, during this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| He went up to get some information, and somebody else was looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| and we couldn't get it at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| And he is the county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| and I think we need to put a lot of faith in him and open up every avenue that he has to do it first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| and then we can go to these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| Mr. Mayor, there are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| Mr. Walls is going to get anything he needs as quickly as we can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| This is a separate group to just look at guidelines and things going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| We'll certainly take into consideration any and all of his recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| but he will be the number one priority in getting the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| Mr. Chairman, guidelines and things going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| We already have things in place, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| Well, they're working everywhere else, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| You know, we have procurement codes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| We have things that are in place right now throughout the county to keep people from spending money they're not supposed to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| So, you know, here again, let's just let Mr. Walls do his job and back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| and then we can, you know, I'm sure this commission can make any necessary adjustments that need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| whether it be by committee or this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Mr. Walls, is there any reason why the mayor could not proceed with this committee that he is looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| Is it going to interfere with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Will you not be able to get your information in a timely fashion if he has this committee looking at guidelines and procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:30| I think it was a good suggestion probably at this time that I not be on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| That I support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| Going forward, probably not, as long as we're able to get our records that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:47| And you've already stated that if you're not, you're going to come back to us and tell us that you can't get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| and we can help you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| As far as you're concerned, having another committee look at these is not going to hinder what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| The only other thing I just want to understand, if you have this committee in, it might be a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| but are you all going to issue reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| I mean, if we get Mr. Walls saying one thing and we get a committee saying something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| is that what this situation is about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| So this committee will issue no reports other than to yourself and to your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| It will look at procedures going forward, but it's completely separate from what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| The only thing I want to be sure that he gets his information in a timely fashion, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| if they're looking at things that he needs, he should have top priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| and they need to stop looking and give them to him right then if he goes up there and asks for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| He is the county auditor, and we have to rely on him to make sure everything is all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| So I would like any committee that he makes, I would like them to agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| if he comes up there and asks for the information and they're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| they quit looking and give it to him, and then when he gets through with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| he gives it back and they can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| We need to get this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| I think the mayor agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| Oh, no, Fred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| Making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| We're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| Fred Sisk, Knox County trustee, has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| Fred, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| Maybe you don't want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Your name is here for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| I've got something for you and for Mr. Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| Could you please come down for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| It's what everybody loves, money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7494)|
| 2:05:02| Several months ago I came before this commission asking the commission to expand the attorney fees for this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:10| And with the understanding that the increased attorney fees would be turned over to Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:16| and specifically earmarked for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| At this time I would like to present two checks for the April and May collections of our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7520)|
| 2:05:28| And the collections total $111,000, just over $111,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:35| So it is with much pride that I give these checks to Mayor Ragsdale and to Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| And I want to thank you for having the courage to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:53| Fred, we want to thank you for doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| It takes a lot of work at the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| and we have an awful lot of people up there that are doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Next on the public forum is Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| I'm Mike Arms, 11913 West Fox Chase Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| Not here as a county employee but as a citizen who used to be a previous county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| And I want to say this many times when I was on commission and never got around to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| I saw an article yesterday in the New Sentinel that was not inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| It just wasn't complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| It compared city council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| And I think it's just important for our citizens to realize that the county budget is three-and-a-half times the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:41| I think at MPC Fact Sheet, I looked at, as of 2006, the city was 103 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| The county was 526, which is five times bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| The city is in the core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| The county is basically a whole lot bigger than the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| When you talk about the issues the county commission has to deal with, complex issues, jail, health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7618)|
| 2:07:05| one of the biggest school systems in the state, I think it's important that our county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| and I know you are, stay in touch with what's going on in Nashville through Tennessee County Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| what's going on in NACO with national issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| And I know many areas are, and I just want to encourage you to stay on top of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| This last year alone, we had jail funding issues in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| We had the TV franchise local battle in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| We had BEP reform in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| I know many of you went to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| And, you know, at our national conferences, I saw a quote yesterday by a city councilman that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:47| I guess I don't see anything beneficial to the citizens referring to our national conventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| And I went through the NACO, and I know some of you are going to NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| I went through the NACO program for this year and the ones for the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| and I've seen the county row in foster care, community block grant funding, air quality non-attainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:08| homeland security regional approaches and federal grant opportunities, brownfield development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| siting industrial parks, workforce development to compete in a global economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| lowering juvenile detention, prescription drug discount cards, which I think we brought from NACO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:23| and brought it back here to Knox County through the county commission, West Nile virus prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| community approaches to pandemic preparation, franchising of cable TV, ensuring citizen service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| computer technology and public libraries, managing jail overcrowding, new approaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| emergency disaster management as your county prepared, managing criminal court justice costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| school construction project management, renewable energy, fueling your county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| and this list could go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| I just want to encourage county commissioners, and I know many of us do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| to stay engaged with those state and national issues because it's important to your citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| and it's something I wanted to say when I was commissioned and never got up to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| Thank you, Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:16| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| A group of citizens met with the engineering department and also with AMET consulting firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070625part1?start=7760)|
